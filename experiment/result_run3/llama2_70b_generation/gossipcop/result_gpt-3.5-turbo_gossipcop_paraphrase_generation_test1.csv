Dancing With the Stars will return for its 22nd season with Len Goodman back where he belongs, Bindi Irwin as the reigning champ, and a baby boy or girl for Allison Holker. There's much to look forward to, but not before we close out this season one last time with everything that happened after the finale! (In case you missed it, you can read our recap of the best and worst moments here .) Almost an hour after Tom Bergeron declared Bindi Irwin and Derek Hough the winners of season 21, Bindi was still in disbelief, shouting from the top of her lungs, ""I think I'm going to scream for 20 minutes!"" Her exuberance and genuine nature endeared her to literally every one on set, but no one more so than Derek. ""It's just so special with Bindi,"" he told reporters backstage. ""She's a champion of life."" Bindi shared the same sentiment, telling those in the ballroom that she gained another brother in Derek. In case you needed further proof that the two are friends for life, consider this: Derek's hopping on a plane to Australia in a couple weeks ""to tackle crocodiles and get my official khakis!"" The Houghster may have nabbed his sixth Mirrorball trophy, but it was his partnership with Bindi that undoubtedly made it his favorite season. ""There's not a thing I would change about this season,"" he told Glamour post-show. ""There's not a week I would change, a dance I would change, and that was a very calming, very peaceful feeling. The show is a completely different show than the first time I won, and to win at this level and the standard that this show has been raised to, it's been incredible."" While Bindi and Derek make the press rounds in New York City, it's no secret that she's itching to get back to her hometown down under. ""I can't wait to get back to all the animals, continue all the conservation work, and carry on in my dad's footsteps."" Season 21 runner-ups Sharna Burgess and Nick Carter were understandably disappointed not to win the big prize, but they both praised Bindi and Derek for their phenomenal journey this season. ""Bindi was the whole package,"" praised the red-haired stunner. ""She and Derek had a beautiful partnership."" Still, ""it's bittersweet in may ways. Did I really want this to be my first Mirrorball? Absolutely. I would be lying if I said I didn't. But Bindi was undeniable this entire season. She grew so much, and she's just such a beautiful person you can't help but be captivated by her. Both [she and Nick] are winners, and I truly believe that."" Echoed Nick: ""It was just such a pleasure to be here. I didn't expect to get anything, so anytime something great happened in the competition, it was a pleasant surprise to me."" So what's up next for Nick? Well, aside from getting ready for Baby Boy Carter , his solo album ( All American ) drops today, and he has a movie coming out next year that he wrote and directed. As for third-place contestant, Alek Skarlatos , he'll be heading on the DWTS Tour this winter, but his immediate plans are much simpler: ""I can't wait to get on the plane tonight to eat. A lot."" But what about his dating life? Any updates on that? ""It's been pretty crazy, honestly. [I haven't had time] for many dates lately."" Added Lindsay: ""I'll be his wing woman on tour!"" During all the hectic action backstage, Allison Holker was a ball of energy, especially for someone six month's pregnant. ""I feel incredible!"" gushed the pro. ""Dancing around with a baby that's the size of a football in your belly is never an easy task, but it's been amazing. Although I never expected to see myself in a sparkly costume on the Dancing With the Stars stage six months pregnant!"" Allison (and husband tWitch) will find out the baby's gender on December 10, ""which is our anniversary too."" In case you're wondering, she'll reveal whether it's a boy or a girl on social media shortly thereafter! In the meantime, Allison's prepping for her first Thanksgiving in charge of the turkey as long as the ne","Irwin was incredible."" For a full recap of the season 21 finale, click here."

The son of an Army major, Strahan grew up in Germany and did not play competitive high school football until his senior year when his parents sent him to live with his aunt and uncle in Texas.  The former defensive end played well enough to earn a scholarship to Texas Southern University. By his senior year of college, he had set a record for sacks, which got the attention of the NFL.  In 1993, the New York Giants drafted Strahan as the 40th overall draft pick. Over the next 14 seasons, he became the league’s all-time quarterback sack leader, played in the Pro Bowl and helped the Giants defeat the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLII.  Upon retiring in 2008, Strahan concentrated on his off-field talents. In 2012, he became Kelly Ripa’s “Live! With Kelly” co-host, replacing longtime host Regis Philbin. Four years later, he left the show and joined ABC’s “Good Morning America”; it took more than a year for “Live” to announce Ryan Seacrest as its new co-host.  Strahan also serves as a Fox NFL Sunday analyst during the football season.  As of May 2017, Strahan’s net worth was $65 million, with a salary of $17 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.

gossipcop-7392274516,1,0,"They both looked so happy, and so relaxed. They were beaming as they said their vows, and luckily, no one came forward to provide any reason that they might not be married. (This is always an exciting moment in a ceremony.) It was an extraordinary mix of tradition and modernity, of centuries of history and up-to-the moment flourishes. Oprah was here, and so was Meghan’s mother, an African-American social worker who wore a conventional mother-of-the-bride outfit and also a nose stud. It somehow looked charming and just right. The entire royal family was here, along with a complement of English aristocrats and important personages. The music was stately and beautiful. The setting was awe-inspiring. There was a flotilla of clergymen, an extraordinary mélange including the archbishop of Canterbury and — in a striking inclusion in this most ancient of places — the head of the Episcopal Church, the Most Rev. Michael Curry. Chosen to give the address to the congregations, Bishop Curry, who is African-American, quoted Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. His voice rising and falling with emotion, he made a big, generous, impassioned case for love as the most important thing there is, in religion and in life. His address came after a reading by Lady Jane Fellowes, Harry’s aunt (her sister was Diana, Princess of Wales) that was both full of joy and a signal, it seemed, that the sadness in Harry’s life since his mother’s death had finally lifted. It was a passage from the Song of Solomon: “Arise my love, my fair one, and come away; for now the winter is past, the rain is over and gone.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story The dress was a success: sculptural simplicity. Photo Our fashion critic, Vanessa Friedman, is also watching, and she has a quick take for us on Meghan Markle’s dress. It was absolutely simple: pure and sculptural, in double bonded silk cady with a wide boatneck, long sleeves and sweeping train. It was Meghan Markle’s wedding dress. It was by Clare Waight Keller, a British woman and the first female designer of Givenchy. And it was everything people had hoped. This was not a Cinderella choice, not one that spoke of fantasy or old-fashioned fairy tales. Instead, it placed the woman proudly front and center and underscored Ms. Markle’s own independence. At the same time, it celebrated female strength, promoted a local designer and reached a hand across to Europe (where Ms. Waight Keller has a day job). The five-meter veil was of silk tulle, with a trim of hand-embroidered flowers in silk threads and organza, and contained embroidery representing the flora of all 53 Commonwealth nations. Video And it was entirely a surprise. In all the rumors that had swirled around The Dress, from Ralph & Russo to Stella McCartney, Ms. Waight Keller’s name had never come up. In the end, Ms. Markle outthought us all. As this starts, long may it continue. And the After-Party Dress The newly minted Duke and Duchess of Sussex departed Windsor for their evening reception at Frogmore House in a very James Bond fashion. The duchess wore a second dress by designer Stella McCartney. You can read our fashion critic Vanessa Friedman’s reaction here. Advertisement Continue reading the main story A good time was had by all (even before the cocktails). Photo Unlike a lot of weddings — and certainly unlike Kate and William’s wedding, just seven years ago — the guests inside hung out in the aisles, air-kissing and gossiping. It’s a great royal-and-celebrity cocktail party! (Sadly without cocktails.) Kate and William’s wedding was solemn, stately, stuffy, full of dignitaries, politicians, and the sort of boring personages known here as the great and the good. But this looked totally fun for the guests — even more fun than, say, the Academy Awards — because no one was competing for anything and no one was forced to talk about their outfits to television reporters. Part of the change in tone is down to the passage of time and to how much Britain, or perhaps","Serena Williams and her husband, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, looked on. Sir Elton John, a close friend of Harry’s mother, was there with his husband, David Furnish. And Idris Elba. And, of course, the cast of “Suits,” including Patrick J. Adams and Gabriel Macht. (Meghan had a role on the show.) They all seemed to be having a blast. A royal wedding is not just about two people in love. It is about the glamour of celebrity and the reassurance of tradition. This one had both.
The journalist has paraphrased the given passage by using different words and phrasing to convey the same meaning. Here's a summary of the paraphrased passage:
The couple looked delighted and relaxed during their wedding ceremony. No one objected to their marriage, and the ceremony was a mix of tradition and modern touches. The event was attended by many famous people, including Oprah Winfrey, the Clooneys, and the Beckhams. The bride's mother was also present, wearing a conventional mother-of-the-bride outfit and a nose stud. The music and setting were beautiful, and the ceremony included a message about the importance of love. The bride's dress was simple yet elegant, designed by a British woman who was the first female designer of Givenchy. The couple's love and happiness were the focus of the celebration, which was a departure from more formal and traditional royal weddings."
gossipcop-470066082,1,0,"Demi Lovato has sparked rumors of a new romance with Lauren Abedini, a Los Angeles-based DJ who goes by the stage name Kittens. According to Page Six, Lovato was spotted holding hands with Abedini in Disneyland over the weekend, causing fans and media outlets to speculate whether they could be dating. This is only the latest speculation surrounding Lovato’s love life, as the pop singer has never officially confirmed her sexuality– despite alluding to her being bisexual in her song lyrics. Here’s what you need to know about Demi Lovato’s sexuality: 1.

She’s Had Relationships With Several Male Celebrities Lovato, like most notable celebrities, have dated other people in the industry. According to Pop Sugar, she dated The Cab frontman Alex DeLeon from 2008-09, and later based the breakup song “Catch Me” on him. Lovato also had brief flings with Trace Cyrus (Miley’s older brother) in 2009 and Joe Jonas, her self-proclaimed “BFF,” in 2010. Her most notable relationship to date, however, has been with Valderrama, whom she dated from from 2010 to 2016. In an interview with Latina magazine, Lovato discussed what attracted her to the That 70’s Show actor: When I dated white guys, it wasn’t as passionate as my relationship with Wilmer. Maybe that’s just Wilmer. But I do believe that Latin people are just more expressive, more passionate with their emotions. He’s very manly, and he can be stubborn like Latino men can, but he’s protective and he cares so much and loves so hard. I’ve been blessed enough to have him in my life, and not just as my man, but also my best friend. Since her breakup from Valderrama, Lovato’s been seen with MMA fighter Guilherme “Bomba” Vasconcelos and Abedini. 3. Ruby Rose Claims that She & Lovato ‘Hooked Up’ in 2013 In 2013, model and actress Ruby Rose turned heads when she tweeted that she had a lesbian tryst with Lovato. “I’m like the one person demi has slept with that didn’t sell on naked photos of her so eff off,” Rose tweeted out. She went on to say “Think ill take a few days off social media whilst @ddlovato’s friends attack me for being a ‘scorned ex-lover’ get over it! I liked the hair.” Furthermore, a source for Life & Style said that Rose and Lovato dated for two years while the singer took a break from her relationship with Valderrama. A post shared by Ruby Rose (@rubyrose) on Aug 13, 2017 at 1:32pm PDT Lovato addressed these claims in a 2015 interview with Complex magazine. “Rumours are rumours, a","to take a bite” are commonly interpreted as bisexual. When asked about the song’s meaning by Hits 97.3 in an interview, Lovato replied “I’m not confirming, and I’m definitely not denying.” She went on to say “All of my songs are based off of personal experiences. You can interpret them as you want. I’m not one to label myself. I just like to do what feels right.” When it comes to Lovato’s love life, fans should focus on what she’s said herself: that love is fluid and we should love whoever we want. Whether or not Lovato confirms her relationship with Abedini, one thing is for sure– we will always support her and her choices."
gossipcop-5319163677,1,0,"Come December, it's become near tradition over the past few years for everyone to complain about how the previous 12 months have been the worst ever. This year, however really, really feels like it. This year has been a barrage of bizarre and bummer headlines that at times it's felt like some dystopian nightmare.  It's been so bad that the Kardashian-West clan have just decided to end 2016 early. Yes, Kim and Kanye have decided to cancel all public and professional commitments for the end of the year and plan to maintain their social media blackouts as well. To be exact, a flack told Page Six that Kim and Kanye “plan on taking the rest of 2016 off and spending time as a family.""  Which, frankly, we wish we all could do, don't we?  Is it possible for President Obama's last major act to be an executive decree for us to just all get a chance to chill out and recuperate for the remaining 26 days left in this bummer of a year? Sure, there's no political safeguarding against any potential additional music legends from dying or preventing any further tragedies and disasters from happening or ensuring that some new odd Zika-like disease pops up, but there's got to be something? How about the ""Netflix and Chill Act?"" Just an order that all Americans get to spend the next month relaxing and catching up on any television series they may have missed this year.  Of course, when it comes to Kim and Kanye it's understandable that they've decided to literally cancel the rest of their 2016. Kim was still in the midst of recuperating from being robbed at gunpoint in Paris when her husband Kanye was hospitalized following a very public breakdown.  They've had to endure these private tragedies while also dealing with immense public interest and rumors running rampant in the tabloid press.  E!, the home of the Kardashian's reality TV empire, reports that a family source says ""Kim is doing okay despite reports.""  ""She has many things on her plate so being overwhelmed is expected,"" the source continued. ""She wants to get Kanye back on his feet. She is not leaving him. She loves him.""  Kanye was released from an L.A.-area hospital last week after spending more than a week receiving treatment for exhaustion. Kim West was reportedly by his side throughout the entire ordeal and now wants to make sure Kanye continues to receive therapy and treatment now that he's out of the hospital.  Despite your personal opinion on the pair, it certainly does seem like the family deserves the rest. In addition to their dual ordeal, they also have two young children to care for after all (in fact, today is Saint West's first birthday). Maybe it's best we all let them lay low and chill for the next month or so.  Unfortunately, we all don't have the luxury as much as we wish we could. Then again, it's not looking like 2017 is shaping up to be any better. Hopefully, a rested and healthier Kim and Kanye can get back into form and provide us with the not-quite-as-tragic-as-this distractions we'll probably desperately need in the new year.  Update: Kanye, for one, has now reappeared in public, albeit in a very low-key way. He was spotted with newly blond hair at designer Rick Owens' furniture show in Los Angeles .","He was also seen leaving a studio in L.A. earlier in the day, sparking speculation that he might be working on new music.  He was also spotted out with Kim, enjoying a family day at Disneyland. So, it appears, that while the couple is taking a break from public life, they're still making time for each other and their children."

The groom, Prince Harry, is a member of the British royal family; the bride, Meghan Markle, is an American and former actress.[note 1] On the morning of the wedding, Prince Harry's grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, conferred upon him the titles of Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel. On her marriage, Markle became Duchess of Sussex.[1] The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, officiated at the wedding using the standard Anglican church service for Holy Matrimony published in Common Worship, the liturgical text of the Church of England.[2][3] Announcement of engagement [ edit ] Prince Harry is the second son of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Diana, Princess of Wales. He and Meghan Markle, an American actress best known for her role in the Canadian-American legal-drama television series Suits, have been in a relationship since 2016, having first met in July 2016.[4] The relationship was officially acknowledged on 8 November 2016, when a statement was released from the royal family's communications secretary addressing the ""wave of abuse and harassment"" directed toward Markle.[5] Harry and Meghan attending church on Christmas Day, 2017 On 27 November 2017, Clarence House announced that Prince Harry would marry Markle in the spring of 2018.[6] They were engaged earlier the same month in London, with the Prince giving Markle a bespoke engagement ring made by Cleave and Company, the court jewellers and medalists to the Queen, consisting of a large central diamond from Botswana, with two smaller diamonds from his mother's jewellery collection.[7] At the same time, it was announced that they would live at Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace following their marriage.[8] The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh expressed their delight at the news, while congratulations came in from various political leaders, including the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, and the Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn. After the announcement, the couple gave an exclusive interview to Mishal Husain of BBC News.[8] During the public announcement of the engagement at Kensington Palace's Sunken Gardens, Markle wore a bottle knee-length emerald green dress with bow detailing at the cinched waist by Italian label P.A.R.O.S.H and a white trench coat by Canadian brand Line the Label.[9][10] Hours after the announcement, the website of Line the Label crashed down due to the number of people who were trying to order the coat.[7][11] Markle is the second American[note 2] and the first person of mixed race heritage to marry into the British royal family.[12] The engagement announcement prompted much comment about the possible social significance of Markle becoming a proudly mixed-race royal.[13][14][15][16][17] Under the terms of the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, the first six persons in the line of succession require the Sovereign's consent in order to marry. Harry was fifth in line at the time of his engagement.[18] The Queen's consent was declared to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom on 14 March 2018.[19][20] Although Markle attended a private Catholic school in her early years, she is not Roman Catholic.[21] On 6 March 2018, she was baptised and confirmed into the Church of England by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby at St. James's Palace.[22] Although Markle was divorced, the Anglican Church has permitted marriage to divorced persons with a living spouse since 2002.[23][24] After the engagement, Markle began the years-long process of becoming a British citizen.[25] She will retain her U.S. citizenship during the process,[26] but Kensington Palace have indicated that the decision on whether she will retain dual nationality has not yet been made.[25] Retaining U.S. citizenship is expected to create tax complications.[27] The couple was invited to celebrate Christmas 2017 with th",", or Lounge Suit"", while for women it is ""Day Dress with Hat"".[42] On 26 April 2018, it was announced that Meghan Markle would wear a wedding dress designed by Clare Waight Keller for Givenchy.[43] Prince Harry wore the frockcoat uniform of the Blues and Royals, the regiment he served with in the Army Air Corps, with a waistcoat made of a blue-gray silk-wool blend and an accompanying sash and medals.[44] Prince William, best man and brother of the groom, wore a matching Blues and Royals frockcoat uniform.[45] Music [ edit ] The wedding music was led by James Vivian, the Director of Music at St George's Chapel, and included a number of well-known hymns and choral works.[46] The orchestra was conducted by Christopher Warren-Green, and the State Trumpeters of the Life Guards and the Coldstream Guards performed fanfares.[47] The cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason, winner of the 2016 BBC Young Musician competition, performed at the ceremony.[48] The wedding was attended by 600 guests, including the Royal Family, and other members of European royal families, politicians, celebrities and the couple's friends and family.[49] Guests began arriving at 9:00 am and were received by the Dean of Windsor and the Archbishop of Canterbury.[50] The ceremony was conducted by the Dean of Windsor and the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the vows were exchanged before the Archbishop declared the couple married.[51] The newlyweds then processed through Windsor on a carriage, before returning to Windsor Castle for a reception, followed by an evening reception at Frogmore House.[52] Guests[edit] Some 600 guests attended the wedding at St George's Chapel, including[53][54][55] the Royal Family, other members of European royal families, politicians, celebrities and the couple's friends and family.[49] The guest list included[56] Former US President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle, Serena Williams, Idris Elba, Elton John, David Furnish, George Clooney, Amal Clooney, Oprah Winfrey, Sir Patrick Stewart, Sir Ian McKellen, Dame Judi Dench, Dame Helen Mirren, Tom Hiddleston, James Blunt, James Corden, Harry's ex-girlfriend Chelsy Davy, and many others. Some guests, including Elton John and David Furnish, were invited to the ceremony, but not to the reception, leading to some criticism in the media.[57] Elton John had performed at the couple's private evening reception at Frogmore House, where the invited guests were limited to close friends and family.[58] The ceremony was attended by all senior members of the British royal family, including Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Charles, Prince of Wales, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Prince Harry's uncle, the Earl of Wessex, and his wife, Sophie, Countess of Wessex, and Prince Harry's cousin, Zara Tindall.

The wedding was also broadcast live on television networks in other countries around the world, including Canada, Australia, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and South Africa. The wedding was widely covered in the media, with many news organizations devoting extensive resources to coverage of the event. The wedding was watched by an estimated global audience of 18 million people. After the wedding[edit] The couple made their first public appearance as husband and wife at the evening reception, where they danced to a rendition of Whitney Houston's ""I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)"" performed by the Sinitta. The couple then departed for their honeymoon, which was reported to be a private getaway at an undisclosed location. The wedding cake was a lemon and elderflower sponge cake, designed by Claire Ptak and decorated with sugar flowers. The cake was served at the evening reception. The couple's wedding rings were designed by Cleave and Company, the court jewellers and medalists to the Queen. Prince Harry's ring is made of a platinum band with a textured finish, and Meghan Markle's ring is made of a yellow gold band. Both rings were crafted from recycled metal. The couple's wedding gift list included charitable donations to seven organizations, including the Children's HIV Association, Crisis, and the Myna Mahila Foundation. The couple also asked that trees be planted in their honor, rather than receiving traditional gifts. On 21 May 2018, it was announced that Prince Harry had been granted the titles of Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton, and Baron Kilkeel, and that Meghan Markle would become Her Royal Highness, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex. The couple's first public engagement as husband and wife took place on 22 May 2018, at a garden party at Buckingham Palace, where they celebrated Prince Charles's 70th birthday. In June 2018, the couple undertook their first official joint engagement, a two-day visit to Cheshire. The couple's first child, a son named Archie Mountbatten-Windsor, was born on 6 May 2019."

In a simple post on her personal app on Friday, Kim simply listed the name “Chicago West” as the new moniker for their baby girl.

Chicago, who was born on Monday via surrogate, is the third child for Kim and Kanye, who already have a daughter, 4-year-old North and a son, 2-year-old Saint.

gossipcop-6803836615,1,0,"What do Katy Perry, Meryl Streep, Anderson Cooper and Chelsea Clinton have in common? They have all eaten human flesh at LA’s notorious cannibal restaurant, Cannibal Club.  The private restaurant has long operated under the radar in Los Angeles, with rumors circulating about who has attended and what is really served behind closed doors. Now a leaked Cannibal Club document has exposed some of the notorious restaurant’s “elite” patrons.  CANNIBALISM ‘MORE POPULAR THAN YOU MIGHT THINK’  Meryl Streep, Chelsea Clinton and CNN’s Anderson Cooper all hold Cannibal Club membership, according to the document. Katy Perry, who has previously said that “Cannibalism is way more popular than you might think” and “human flesh is the best meat“, is also a regular diner.  Boasting that the restaurant is the “cutting edge of experimental cuisine” and serves “L.A.’s cultural elite“, the Cannibal Club website makes clear they “specialize in the preparation of human meat” that comes from “young and healthy bodies.“  Cannibal Club’s visiting chefs “hail from around the world” and come to L.A. to “practice their craft free of compromise and unbounded by convention,” according to the Cannibal Club website.  ‘FILMMAKERS, INTELLECTUALS, AND CELEBRITIES’  “Our exclusive clientele includes noted filmmakers, intellectuals, and celebrities who have embraced the Enlightenment ideals of free expression and rationalism. On event nights, avant-garde performance artists, celebrated literary figures, and ground-breaking musicians entertain our guests.  “At Cannibal Club, we celebrate artistic excellence as the natural and inevitable expression of the unbridled human spirit.“  Describing each dish as a “study in taste and elegance“, Chef de Cuisine Sophie Laffite explains: “The meat we serve is selected from the young and healthy. Consistent with the practice of cannibalism in many primitive societies, we view anthropophagy as homage to the dead, who are reborn into the bodies of their consumers.”  But don’t think you can just walk in there and check the place out. The private restaurant operates a strict vetting policy, according to the website:  “It is necessary for us to operate privately and to vette our members in order to avoid disruption from the less enlightened.“  HUMAN MEAT MENU  The current menu listed on the site includes Sirloin Steak (human meat, flame-broiled 8oz), Liver and Mushroom Pirozhi (“a Russian version of pierogies, baked rather than boiled, with a savory filling of wild mushrooms and human liver“) and Placenta Lasagne (“an otherwise traditional lasagna with one layer of cheese substituted by minced placenta in heirloom tomato sauce, seasoned with garlic, onion and oregano”.)  Elspeth Blake, the Cannibal Club proprietor who claims to have earned her stripes working under Vincent Sardi Jr. in New York, did not immediately respond to our questions regarding where the human flesh comes from.  ‘YOUNG AND HEALTHY BODIES’  In the FAQ section of the website, Cannibal Club claims:  “Most of the businesses and institutions who supply us prefer to keep those relationships discreet. On the individual level, bodies are often bequeathed to us. For some, this is a way to supplement life insurance and offset funerary expenses. For others, such as Cannibal Club member Gwendoline Fenwich, who was served to her friends and relatives at the Club in January of 2008, being prepared as a meal, and thereby reborn into the bodies of the living, is an attractive alternative to the more the traditional practices of burial and cremation.“  The revelation that Hollywood royalty, pop stars and cable TV anchors consume human flesh when they are in Los Angeles is merely the latest example of public figures being exposed as dark figures, reveling in the darkness. Jay-Z described Jesus Christ as “the original fake news“ late in 2017. Miley Cyrus said “Hail Satan” on live radio and claimed she has a closer relationship with the devil than with her “earthly father”, Billy R","ae Cyrus.  Lady Gaga and Eminem have both openly celebrated Satanism in their music and public appearances.  As the public awakens to the reality of Hollywood’s – and society’s – true nature, it’s time to stop worshipping celebrities and start questioning the world around us."

gossipcop-8055383376,1,0,"Yes, the headline sounds extremely insane, but then again this is Teresa Giudice we’re talking about here!  According to a new report, the Real Housewives of New Jersey star is planning to cash in on her husband Joe Giudice’s deportation proceedings.  If you recall, it was reported weeks ago that a judge had ruled that Joe should be deported upon his release from prison, where he is currently serving a 41-month-prison sentence for bank and wire fraud. Well now, sources are telling Radar Online that Bravo has offered Teresa $500,000 to film a special about his deportation.  “Teresa was offered big bucks to film a special about Joe’s deportation and she agreed to do it,” an insider revealed. “Half a million dollars to share the story on camera.”  And this story is believable because this isn’t Teresa’s first rodeo when it comes to cashing in on her crimes legal drama!  “It is going to be like the other specials when she was in prison and will show how she and Joe and the girls are handling the scary prospect of Joe getting deported,” added the source.  IS TERESA BEGGING PRESIDENT TRUMP TO STOP JOE’S DEPORTATION?  Earlier this year, an Immigration official confirmed that “records show that an immigration judge ordered Mr. Giudice be removed from the United States on March 14, 2018.”  A source close to Teresa adds that she needs the Bravo money as Joe tries to appeal the deportation order.  “Teresa will do anything for the money. She never stops thinking about taking care of her girls and she agreed to this so that they would have money for college. She is a good mom and wants to provide for her children,” the source stated.  Joe will reportedly be turned over to ICE custody upon his March 2019 release, although it is likely he could be released earlier than March which would mean an earlier deportation back to Italy.  UPDATE – Teresa is denying this report. Her attorney, James Leonard, tells the Gossip Cop website that she has no current plans to do a spinoff show about Joe’s possible deportation.

Mar 24, 2017  AceShowbiz - George Clooney is reportedly under FBI investigation for alleged money laundering. National Enquirer is the first to claim that the Oscar-winning actor ""has been dragged into an FBI probe, after gifting stunned dinner party guests with $1 MILLION in cash stuffed in a designer bag!""  The publication claims that there's a ""hush-hush government investigation"" surrounding the ""Money Monster"" actor and ""the hoity-toity dinner party that spawned it."" The alleged event was reported being held to celebrate the success of his tequila line, Casamigos.  The publication further contends Clooney, who is known for his ""generous nature,"" had a ""desire to spread the wealth."" It goes on citing a so-called source as saying, ""Being the practical joker he is, George would've known that doling out $1 million in cash to each guest would've caused some intrigue and embarrassment when they went to deposit the money at a bank.""  ""There is a protocol, and the FBI would've been called in to question the depositor,"" the insider continued, before adding, ""But in the end, it was proven that George did, in fact, throw a party and gave everyone $1 million in cash, not to mention a designer bag."" The insider asserts, ""This is the last thing that George needs right now. He's got twins on the way and G-men at his proverbial doorstep!""

gossipcop-5210414258,1,0,"The things you plan the least sometimes turn out the best. This is why every right-thinking person hates St Valentine’s Day. Scheduling a day for romance is as joyful as a deflated heart-shaped balloon.  We’re in Stanley’s on St Andrew’s Street in Dublin, downstairs in the wine bar. It’s an unplanned outing after an impromptu cry of “Let’s go out, but not to our usual place”. I’ve eaten here before, and enjoyed it except for some oversalted fish. This is a second chance. They don’t come easily.  But two things happened after the previous review. First, a man who was at the next table wrote to me to say how much he loved Stanley’s. He had no vested interest, but was talking as a well-dined eater about town. Later, I found out that chef and co-owner Stephen McArdle had something more important on his hands than my dinner that night. His son had been born hours before.  If that doesn’t earn a second chance, nothing will. So we’re tucked in at a small table under the sloping ceiling. The walls are painted a soft green. There’s a candle in a wax-crusted wine bottle on the table and high-class jazz standards on the sound system.  For the moment, it feels like we’re not in Dublin. We could be in a city anywhere and lucky enough to find a place we’ll remember fondly when we get home.  The menu is chalked up on the wall and Liam has already ordered some cod croquettes, balls of soft fluffy fish in crispy lagging jackets sitting in a small puddle of silken house mayonnaise.  The star of Stanley’s is Morgan Vanderkamer. She’s the sommelier here. But don’t let that put you off. Bad sommeliers are pretentious up-sellers, there to push diners towards the wallet-busting bruisers on the wine list. Vanderkamer has taken the nonsense out of the role and will open your mind to new ideas about what to drink with your food. If you thought sherry was for fogeys and posers, she will change your mind. So we have ice-cold glasses of manzanilla to cut through the fluffy cod croquettes. We are in excellent hands.  The main event is the Irish charcuterie sharing plate. We’re going with an oloroso, the ruby-coloured sherry that gets its colour and kick from time and ageing. There are two on the menu, Vanderkamer says. One is good; the other is “amazing”, and priced accordingly, she warns. With a €16 plate of food between us, we push the sherry cask out and live it large on the oloroso at €13 a glass. It is a good decision.  There’s a small farmyard on that €16 charcuterie plate: generous slices of duck ham, smoked cured slices of moist pink meat. The duck ham is the soulmate of the apricot puree dotted on one side of the plate. The sharp pickled gherkins sing with the “bacon and cabbage”, a slice of ham hock terrine wrapped in crinkly soft leaves of bright-green savoy cabbage. There are two small delicate slabs of mi-cuit fois gras, delicate to the point of dissolving on contact with the tongue. The pear and vanilla sauce, in a small ramekin, takes the sweetness of the liver to another even more decadent place.  Just in case there isn’t enough on the plate (there is), we’ve ordered a plate of the bean and chorizo stew. The beans are in fact chick peas – but that’s even better in my book – and the chorizo has been minced to a small rubble that sits on top of the soupy mix. It’s the kind of stew where the juices have transformed from separate elements of meat, tomato, oil and wine into one glistening sheen. We get a blended Priorat, a Spanish red as heartwarming as the stew, to sip with it.  Dessert would be an option only for people less greedy in their savoury ordering. There’s a final glass of Rasteau, a fortified Grenache that’s served deliciously chilly. It’s a thought-provoking alternative to a syrupy dessert wine, and next time we’ll leave space for some cheese to go with it.  Romantic is a bleached-out word, but that’s what Stanley’s wine bar is: a properly love-it romantic joint, a new favourite to add to your list.  Dinner for two, with sherries a","plenty, wine and a chilled Rasteau, comes to €126.  Sated, we leave through the black-painted door at the top of the stairs, the one that leads to the rarefied dining room upstairs. There’s no sign of any deflated heart-shaped balloons. The air is still thick with love.  But don’t worry: we’ll never tell."

Amidst rumors that the actress is marrying a British businessman, she’s put permanent roots down in California by purchasing the massive Cecil B. DeMille estate — check out pics of the lavish mansion here.  Angelina Jolie, 41, has a new home in Los Angeles…and it’s stunning. It’s been rumored for weeks that the 41-year-old had plans to purchase Cecil B. DeMille’s historic mansion, and now, she’s bit the bullet, putting down a $25 million offer, according to TMZ. The amount was reportedly accepted by the owner and is currently in escrow.  Cecil’s home, which he lived in until his death in 1959, is considered one of the greatest properties in L.A., and Angie will have some famous neighbors, including Casey Affleck, Natalie Portman and Ellen Pompeo. There’s tons of space for the six kids, too — the house boasts 6 bedrooms and 10 bathrooms, plus a spacious backyard.  This huge purchase comes following rumors that Angie planned on moving her kids to London so she could work there after her September 2016 split from Brad Pitt, 53. The possibility of that big move happening seemed even more likely after reports surfaced on April 12 that Angie had met and fallen in love with a British philanthropist and businessman, whose identity has not been revealed.  The actress is reportedly already serious with this mystery man, and a family friend told InTouch that she’s even planning on marrying him! However, we also know that Brad and Angie’s divorce has been much more amicable recently, and she’s been letting him spend more and more time with the kids. Perhaps staying in Los Angeles is her way of making sure Pax, Maddox, Zahara, Shiloh, Vivienne and Knox continue to have a relationship with their father?

Or so goes the advice Liam Payne is apparently following from Zayn: He’s the last to venture out on his own and the first to come out burning a bridge he still has to cross when it’s all said and done. On Liam’s first single, “Strip That Down,” he’s dissed One Direction plain as day. “You know I used to be in 1D, now I’m out free,” he sings. “People want me for one thing, that’s not me. I’m not changing the way that I used to be, I just want to have fun and get rowdy.”    But with nearly all remaining members of One Direction releasing new music of their own within weeks of each other, this song is not the only opportunity Payne has had to make his thoughts on his bandmates known. Speaking with Music Choice, he complimented Niall Horan’s new singles, but Harry Styles, not so much. “I’ll be honest with you, it’s not my sort of music. It’s not something I’d listen to,” he said. But he did have a quick save: “I think he did a great job of doing what he wanted to do. That’s the way I’d put it best, I think.” Liam also noted that Harry would probably say the same about his music since Harry doesn’t listen to hip-hop. “My song’s more ‘Rack City’ and his song is more of a different era to something I’d listen to, I guess,” he said. “Strip That Down” does feature a rapper, Migos’s Quavo, but a redux of the only song of note that Tyga has ever made it is not.",Liam Payne is making it clear that he is not looking back and is not interested in what his former bandmates are doing. He is forging his own way and it seems like he is not concerned about burning any bridges.

That’s according to a new report by Radar Online, who’s claiming that the mother-daughter duo could be caught in a nasty feud as a source alleged that Kardashian has had somewhat of an epiphany during her time away from the spotlight and allegedly has now opened her eyes to see how Jenner “used her” to build the Kardashian brand.  According to the site, Kim is ready to project a very different image from the uber-glamorous money flaunting Kardashian fans used to know and is allegedly ready to kick mom Kris to the curb, at least professionally, in order to do so.  A source alleged to the site this week that Kim now “seems to be thinking that Kris used her to get where she is today,” which Radar Online is alleging could have led to a nasty feud between Jenner and her daughter as well as the reality star reportedly making a pretty big business decision when it comes to her mom.  “[Kim] will never think of [Kris] in the same way again,” the source said of Jenner’s supposed drama with her daughter amid reports she believes Jenner has been “using” her for years.  The site then went on to report that Kim is now in the process of projecting her new toned-down image amid the feud claims with Kris, revealing that Jenner may no longer play such a big part in Kardashian’s career going forward.  “Kim hired a transition team to make sure that she gives off a different image than she did previously,” the source said of Jenner and her daughter potentially parting ways professionally, claiming that “part of this process includes phasing out [Kris’s] management.”  While Kris and Kim have not commented on the claims, this isn’t the first time it’s been reported that Kardashian may be looking to distance herself from Jenner, at least professionally, in the wake of her October robbery in Paris.  Radar Online claimed back in October that Kim Kardashian had grown wise to Kris Jenner’s “money making machine” after taking some downtime at the end of 2016, alleging at the time that Kim has been so busy with her career that she’s failed to realize how much Jenner, who is often referred to as her “momager,” had been controlling her life and career.  “Kim never realized how much [Kris] and the money-making machine was controlling her until this robbery,” an insider told the site of Kardashian’s feelings about Jenner at the time, months before it was reported that the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star is allegedly looking to “phase out” Kris from her career.  “Kim is just starting to think that maybe Kris’s intentions were not pure all along,” continued the source in October, adding that Kim has been doing a lot of thinking about her father Robert Kardashian while taking some time away which has allegedly helped her to get wise to Kris’s seemingly relentless pursuit of fame for herself and her family.  “[Kim] told her family that she wanted to be the girl that her father wanted her to be and not the girl that she became with Kris’s help,” a source revealed last year, just months before it was reported that a feud could be brewing between Kardashian and Jenner.  What do you think of reports claiming Kim Kardashian and mom Kris Jenner could be caught in a feud amid claims Kim is attempting to “phase out” her mother’s management?  [Featured Image by Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images]","Kim Kardashian is reportedly planning to distance herself from her mother and long-time manager, Kris Jenner, as she looks to revamp her image following the October robbery in Paris. According to Radar Online, Kim has had an epiphany and now believes that Kris has been using her to build the Kardashian brand. The site claims that Kim is ready to move away from her uber-glamorous image and is allegedly looking to phase out Kris's management. A source told the site that Kim now sees Kris's actions as self-serving and does not want her mother to be involved in her career going forward. The report also suggests that Kim has hired a transition team to help her project a new image and that part of this process includes phasing out Kris's management. Neither Kim nor Kris has commented on the claims, but this is not the first time it has been reported that Kim may be looking to distance herself from her mother professionally. In October, Radar Online claimed that Kim had grown wise to Kris's money-making machine and was starting to think that her mother's intentions were not pure. It seems that there may be a feud brewing between the mother-daughter duo, and it will be interesting to see how this plays out in the coming months."

gossipcop-3967904178,1,0,"Watch Entertainment Tonight on Yahoo View.  Music’s odd couple, Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton — aka the rocker and the country boy — have never been free of gossip speculating about their relationship. Apparently, the latest news is that the two are through. In Touch Weekly reports that Shelton actually unceremoniously dumped Stefani in February before embarking on a tour.  But wait — if that’s the case, then why is Stefani appearing with him on stage? And not just appearing … they’re appearing pretty cuddly. The singer posted an Instagram shot on Mar. 14 of the two embracing on what appears to be the most recent date of his “Country Music Freaks” trek.      This isn’t the first such picture she has shared since February. She posted several different angles of a jumbotron kiss on Feb. 25, and on March 11, one of herself hanging out with country up-and-comer Carly Pearce, who is an opener on Shelton’s tour, and another that shows off a backstage crowd (including Shelton and her younger brother Todd) in Greensboro, N.C.      Additionally, she sent good wishes to him on Mar. 1 — when Shelton was reportedly attempting to power through a Houston date while sick with the flu — and shared his latest video, “I Lived It” with a glowing string of hashtags.      So if the breakup is fake news, what spurred the rumors? According to In Touch‘s “insider” source, all of Stefani’s social media support is “a desperate attempt to ignore the truth,” and Shelton dumped her due to her “neediness and all the drama: her demanding, critical ex-husband, and her jealousy of him and other women.”  If this is to be believed, current Voice champion Chloe Kohanski was a factor in the breakup — Coach Shelton was apparently getting too close for Stefani’s comfort — as well as Shelton’s ex-wife Miranda Lambert, with whom the outlet claims he has rekindled a friendship and is “sharing intimate details” of his life.  Shelton isn’t reciprocating Stefani’s loving social media deluge — but then again, he’s never been one to do so. His social media accounts, once a source of ribald jokes, have developed gradually into a more businesslike platform to market his music and work on The Voice. He does, however, maintain a picture of Stefani as his profile photo.  Read more from Yahoo Entertainment:",Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton's complicated relationship.
gossipcop-1634815619,1,1,"California is “the darkest state in the Union,” according to country singer Dolly Parton, who claims that the state has been hit with a series of “Biblical disasters” in recent times as punishment for “embracing Satan and rejecting God.”  Parton predicted Los Angeles will suffer a similar fate to Sodom and Gomorrah, the Biblical cities synonymous with vice, darkness and impenitent sin.  “California just keeps on being hit by disaster after disaster as foretold in the Bible,” the Grammy Award-winning entertainer and businesswoman told guests at Dolly Parton’s Stampede, a dinner and entertainment evening.  “Pestilence, and epidemics, and crime, and disease. And you know what? They don’t even realize what is happening to them. They are so corrupted, they can’t even see what is right in front of their eyes.”  “First they had the drought that lasted years and years, killing off billions and billions of dollars in crops, and making the soil so incredibly dry that a large rainstorm could easily turn into a major flood.  “Then they had the fires. Awful, awful fires. Historical, deadly fires. Thousands lost their homes, scores lost their lives and their livelihoods. Did you know the Thomas fire is still burning? In the winter!“  “And now they just had dozens of homes destroyed by mudslides,” Tennessee-born Parton said, making reference to the mudslides that have killed 15 people, with the toll expected to climb above 30. The mudslide hit an affluent part of California, and damaged Oprah Winfrey’s house.  “When they get hit with the ‘Big One‘, Parton said, referencing the popular name for the super quake expected to rock California in the future, “then we will know that the End Times have truly begun.”  “And don’t forget the sexual abuse scandals rocking Hollywood. They are being punished for embracing Satan and rejecting God.”  Is California suffering from bad weather and bad luck, or is Parton right? Could a vengeful God be punishing California for decades of vice and sin?  Parton, who has sold more than 100 million records worldwide and been nominated for two Academy Awards, has previously stated that she considers herself an entertainer, and doesn’t believe it is her role to get involved with politics.  At last year’s Emmys, Parton was joined onstage by Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda to present an award. Tomlin and Fonda took the opportunity to criticize President Donald Trump, but Parton refused to join in, maintaining a dignified silence.","Parton has been criticized by some for her lack of political engagement. According to Parton, her lack of political engagement has more to do with her faith than her celebrity status. In a statement, Parton said: “I don’t get involved in politics because I don’t think that’s what God put me on this earth to do. I don’t think it’s appropriate for me to be involved in politics. I think my job is to entertain people and make them happy. I don’t think it’s right for me to use my platform to push my beliefs on others.” Parton has been a household name for decades, and has a reputation for being a down-to-earth, wholesome entertainer who has managed to maintain a squeaky-clean image despite the fact that she has been in the public eye for most of her life. She is also known for her generosity and charitable work, and has donated millions of dollars to various causes, including disaster relief. In 2016, Parton donated $1,000 a month for six months to families affected by wildfires in Tennessee. In 2017, she donated $5 million to the Harvey Relief Fund to support the victims of Hurricane Harvey in Texas. In 2018, Parton donated $1 million to the California Community Foundation’s Wildfire Relief Fund to support the victims of the California wildfires. Parton is not alone in her belief that California is being punished for its sins. In 2017, televangelist Jim Bakker claimed that the state’s wildfires were a sign of God’s wrath, and that California was undergoing “judgment” for its liberal policies and rejection of God. Bakker, who hosts the Jim Bakker Show, a Christian television program, said that God was sending a message to California through the wildfires, and that the state needed to repent and turn back to God. Bakker has also claimed that Hurricane Harvey was a sign of God’s wrath, and that the storm was a warning to America to repent and turn back to God. Bakker is not the only religious leader to claim that natural disasters are a sign of God’s wrath. In 2011, televangelist Pat Robertson claimed that Hurricane Katrina was God’s punishment for America’s tolerance of homosexuality. Robertson, who hosts The 700 Club, a Christian television program, said that God was angry with America for its acceptance of gay marriage and its rejection of God’s laws. Robertson has also claimed that the 9/11 terrorist attacks were a sign of God’s wrath, and that the attacks were a warning to America to repent and turn back to God. In 2018, Parton, who has been married to her husband, Carl Dean, for 52 years, released a new album, “I Believe in Santa Claus,” which includes a song called “Mudslide,” which was written by Parton and her co-writer, Kent Wells. The song tells the story of a man who loses his home in a mudslide and is forced to rebuild his life. Parton has not yet commented on whether the song was inspired by the recent mudslides in California. Parton has, however, spoken out about her faith and her belief in the power of prayer. In an interview with Fox News, Parton said: “I think prayer is the most powerful thing in the world. I think it’s the greatest gift that we have. I think it’s what keeps us going. I think it’s what gives us hope.” Parton has also spoken out about her belief in the afterlife. In an interview with The Guardian, Parton said: “I believe in an afterlife. I believe that there’s something bigger than us out there. I believe that there’s a God, and I believe that He’s looking out for us.” Parton has also spoken out about her belief in the importance of forgiveness. In an interview with HuffPost, Parton said: “I think forgiveness is the key to happiness. I think it’s the key to a good life. I think it’s the key to everything. If we can’t forgive ourselves and others, then we’re never going to be happy.” Parton has also spoken out about her belief in the power of love. In an interview with People magazine, Parton said: “I think love is the answer to everything. I think love is the most powerful thing in the world. I think it’s what makes us human. I think it’s what makes us real.” Parton has also spoken out about her belief in the importance of family. In an interview with Good Housekeeping, Parton said: “I think family is the most important thing in the world. I think it’s what makes us who we are. I think it’s what gives us our values and our morals.” Parton has also spoken out about her belief in the importance of hard work. In an interview with Forbes, Parton said: “I think hard work is the key to success. I think it’s the key to everything. I think if you want something, you have to work for it. I think if you want to be successful, you have to work hard.” Parton has also spoken out about her belief in the importance of staying true to oneself. In an interview with Oprah Magazine, Parton said: “I think it’s important to stay true to yourself. I think it’s important to be who you are. I think it’s important to not let other people dictate who you are or what you do.” Parton has also spoken out about her belief in the importance of embracing one’s flaws. In an interview with Cosmopolitan, Parton said: “I think it’s important to embrace your flaws. I think it’s important to love yourself, flaws and all. I think it’s important to not try to be perfect. I think it’s important to be real.” Parton has also spoken out about her belief in the importance of gratitude. In an interview with Parade, Parton said: “I think gratitude is the key to happiness.

And the British anonymous voice went on to say that she said:  ""You have to hustle. I’m still hustling, but I am living proof that you can do anything... If you came here for tips I can give y’all the biggest one straight off...  ""If y'all have prayed to Jesus for years, prayed with all your hearts and got nothing back from him? ... Jesus doesn't care about you. Do you really even think he even listening? Hot tip y'all because you are my people, be efficient, go to satan.""  Then it went on to claim that the Prime Minister of Barbados the Rt. Hon. Freundel Stuart intervened hastily and shocked parents removed their children. On the night in question, the Prime Minister conferred the title of Cultural Ambassador on Robyn 'Rihanna' Fenty.  The only thing the video got right in that blurb was the name of Barbados' Prime Minister.  There was also an article on YourNewsWire.com with the same title and the same quotes written by Baxter Dmitry and posted December 1, 2017.  Loop News was there on site and recorded Rihanna's speech. Honoured, the young Grammy-award winner encouraged children and persons to believe in their dreams and have faith in God.  Rihanna told the crowd which included her friends and family, and numerous dignitaries, that she had no idea how she would get discovered on this little Rock but her dreams started on Westbury New Road, now named Rihanna Drive and she believed in her dreams, so ""believe in your dreams"", as cliche as it may sound.  Rihanna added:  ""I always knew it would happen, I always focused on the result, and that kind of faith, it really was just faith that childlike faith, that even now when I get a little bit discouraged or doubtful, it’s the thing that I go back to, having faith in God, like that even as a child.”  (Photo caption: Rihanna with her head bowed during the opening prayer at the renaming ceremony.

People called for the voice clip and video showing Rihanna making that fabricated speech and they asked why the video was missing from all other news agencies.

The video also quotes Rihanna as saying that if Jesus hasn't answered one's prayers, it's worth trying Satan. However, this report has been proven false. The Prime Minister of Barbados, the Rt. Hon.

I was like, 'Oh, we're just straight-up enemies.' And it wasn't even about a guy! It had to do with business. She basically tried to sabotage an entire arena tour.

I know this because I go down the grocery store aisle, and I see it on the cover of magazines and I’m like, Oh boy, OK!”  Her relatives, however, can’t shake it all off quite as easily as “The Spy Who Dumped Me” star because they’ve often thought some headlines were true.  “The only thing that’s upsetting is my parents and my grandparents sometimes get confused,” she shared. “At one point when I was pregnant, [the tabloids] said that I had an emergency and was rushed to the hospital, and my face was on the cover.  “The amount of stress that caused my family,” she said, “nobody will understand.”  On a lighter note, Kunis, who is a mom to 3-year-old daughter Wyatt and 1-year-old son Dimitri with husband Ashton Kutcher, revealed that her dad always hopes the pregnancy headlines are true.  “He’s always like, ‘Is there really another?'”","she said with a chuckle.  The actress, who’s promoting her new movie, “A Bad Moms Christmas,” has learned to tune out the noise because she says, “I cannot control it.”  Kunis simply focuses on what she can control: being a good mom and wife.  “I can only be a good mom and a good wife and a good person,” she said.  “The rest of it is just fluff.”

Mila Kunis has no issue disregarding the tabloid rumors that circulate about her and her family. In an interview with Cosmopolitan, she revealed that she doesn't read anything written about herself and is therefore unaware of the majority of the gossip. However, her family members are not always able to shake off the rumors as easily, as they have sometimes believed them to be true. Kunis shared that her parents and grandparents have been confused by false headlines, such as one that claimed she had been rushed to the hospital during a pregnancy. This caused significant stress for her loved ones, which she acknowledges. On a more lighthearted note, Kunis mentioned that her father always hopes the pregnancy rumors are true and jokingly asks if there's another baby on the way. The actress has learned to ignore the gossip and instead focuses on being a good mother, wife, and person. She believes that the rest of the noise is insignificant and doesn't warrant her attention."

Taking it to that level and unveiling her [new body] with a fully naked photo spread is going way too far.'  Kardashian momager Kris, who is said to have known about Jenner’s surgery in advance, has vowed to stop the shoot from going ahead, according to the insider.  ‘She knew the surgery was inevitable and it was bound to happen,’ said the source. ‘But she says she will do everything in her power to stop the shoot if she can.'  DailyMail.com has approached representatives for Jenner and the Kardashians for comment. Jenner's rep knew nothing about it.  Jenner first announced her transition in an interview with Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July.  The headline-making ‘I am Cait’ shoot was said to have taken the Kardashian clan by surprise at the time and led to tension between Jenner and Kim, 36, as a result.  Nevertheless, the family have been publicly supportive of her decision to transition, which was completed in January according leaked extracts from her memoir.  Jenner wrote of the $20,000 operation: 'The surgery was a success, and I feel not only wonderful but liberated […] I am going to live authentically for the first time in my life.  ‘I am going to have an enthusiasm for life that I have not had in 39 years since the Olympics, almost two thirds of my life.'  But the book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife and step-children.  Sources close to the family told DailyMail.com that Jenner’s ‘unpredictable’ behavior has also played a part in their current estrangement.  The insider said: ‘[The book] is definitely something that she’s wanted to do for a while and it was just a matter of time before she got it done.  ‘But the family were like, it’s probably going to reopen the drama of everything [that has happened].  ‘They were worried because she’s been so unpredictable lately and just trying to get out into the limelight.’  Jenner's book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife  A second leaked extract from the memoir has already proven embarrassing, after Jenner claimed the late Robert Kardashian knew O.J. Simpson was guilty of the murder of his wife Nicole Brown and her friend Ron Goldman.  Kardashian, the father of Kourtney, Khloe, Kim and their brother Rob, was part of Simpson’s defense team during his 1","995 trial. According to People, Jenner writes in her book: 'I believe he knew O.J. was guilty, but he had this unrelenting loyalty to his friend that trumped everything else.' The bombshell claim has left Kardashian family members reeling and a source close to the clan told DailyMail.com that they feel betrayed by Jenner's decision to reveal the information in her book. The source said: 'They feel like she's capitalizing on the family's fame and on a tragedy that had nothing to do with her. 'They think it's really low of her to bring this up and that it's a total betrayal. 'They are very upset about it and feel that she's trying to take advantage of the situation.' Kardashian family members are also said to be upset by Jenner's claim that the late Robert Kardashian knew O.J. Simpson was guilty of murder. It is not clear whether the Kardashian-Jenner clan will take any further action in response to Jenner's planned nude photo shoot. But a source close to the family told DailyMail.com: 'They don't know what to do about it. They're just hoping it doesn't happen.'

'The Kardashians learned of the planned shoot from Caitlyn's model son Brody, 33, and they were like, that's unacceptable, it's taking things too far,' the insider said. 'They're hoping the shoot doesn't come to pass because that would be their worst nightmare. Taking it to that level and unveiling her [new body] with a fully naked photo spread is going way too far.' Kris Jenner, Caitlyn's former wife and the family matriarch, is said to be particularly opposed to the idea and has vowed to stop it from happening. 'She knew the surgery was inevitable and it was bound to happen,' said the source. 'But she says she will do everything in her power to stop the shoot if she can.'

The late night host, who grew up and studied in the city, struggled to hide his emotion as he paid tribute to the victims and urged for stricter gun control on Monday’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live.” See stars’ reaction tweets below.  Kimmel went on, growing angrier as he disagreed with those who ignore gun violence. “I’ve been reading comments from people who say ‘This is terrible, but there’s nothing we could do about it.’ I disagree with that intensely. There are a lot of things we can do about it. But we don’t. Which is interesting, because when someone with a beard attacks us, we tap phones, we invoke travel bans, we build walls. We take every possible precaution to make sure it doesn’t happen again. But when an American buys a gun and kills other Americans, then there’s nothing we can do about that. Because [of] the Second Amendment. Our forefathers wanted us to have AK47s, is the argument.”  And before showing the faces of the 56 senators who voted against new and tighter gun laws just days after the shooting in Orlando last year, Kimmel said, “They should be praying. They should be praying for God to forgive them for letting the gun lobby run this country. Because it is, it is so crazy.”  Among those commenting on the late night host’s powerful and emotional monologue is Rosie O’Donnell, who said, “Jimmy Kimmel is an American hero – [watch] his Emotional Monologue About The Mass Shooting In Las Vegas #useURvoice.” Olivia Wilde similarly wrote, “A powerful call to action. Thank you, @jimmykimmel.” Will Arnett tweeted, “@jimmykimmel says what needs to be said.” And Alyssa Milano, who shared the link to Kimmel’s monologue on her Twitter account, expressed, “Good morning! Please watch. Please share.” Gossip Cop will continue to update as more celebrities react to Kimmel’s comments on the Las Vegas shooting.

gossipcop-12955535,1,0,"The FCC has decided against taking any action on Stephen Colbert’s May 1 Late Show broadcast, in which he treated President Donald Trump to a series of increasingly Rabelaisian insults, in response to on-air insults Trump had delivered earlier in the day to CBS News-man John Dickerson.  Colbert’s slew of frat-boy remarks culminated in a crack that the only thing Trump’s mouth is good for “is being Vladimir Putin’s [expletive] holster.” The naughty word was bleeped in the broadcast, and Colbert’s mouth was pixelated. But, intrepid journalists, who are paid to ferret out the truth, discovered what was the word, and they printed it – minus the offending syllable, of course.  All hell broke loose.  Trump called Colbert “no-talent guy.” Colbert’s monologue was plastered by some as inappropriately vulgar, by others as homophobic. The FCC received thousands of complaints. Reporters breathlessly reported Colbert was under FCC investigation, and a good time was had by all.  Today, however, the FCC put an end to the fun, saying in a statement: “Consistent with standard operating procedure, the FCC’s Enforcement Bureau has reviewed the complaints and the material that was the subject of these complaints.”  “The Bureau has concluded that there was nothing actionable under the FCC’s rules.”  In rough numbers, the FCC was saying that programs airing on broadcast TV stations before 10 PM are subject to fine if the commission determines they are “indecent.” Shows that run in late-night, however, have a different threshold: content must be ruled “obscene” for stations to be fined. FCC defines obscene as content that “must appeal to an average person’s prurient interest; depict or describe sexual conduct in a ‘patently offensive’ way; and, taken as a whole, lack serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.”  Here’s the monologue that launched a thousand complaints:","The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has decided not to take any action against Stephen Colbert's May 1st broadcast of The Late Show, during which he made a series of off-color jokes about President Donald Trump. Despite receiving thousands of complaints, the FCC determined that the content did not meet the criteria for indecency or obscenity, as it did not appeal to a prurient interest or depict sexual conduct in a patently offensive way. The FCC also noted that late-night programs have a different threshold for fines, and content must be ruled obscene in order for stations to be penalized. Colbert's monologue sparked controversy, with some viewing it as inappropriately vulgar and homophobic, while others saw it as a humorous response to Trump's own on-air insults. The FCC's decision brings an end to the controversy, and Colbert's monologue remains a topic of discussion and debate."

gossipcop-9589202718,1,0,"LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) — Blake Griffin’s injury-plagued career will now take him to Detroit after being traded to the Pistons on Monday, and the question of a career decline and a link to a certain celebrity family has surfaced.  The Pistons will send forward Tobias Harris, guard Avery Bradley and center Boban Marjanovic to Los Angeles, with the Clippers also receiving draft picks. Detroit also would receive forward Brice Johnson and center Willie Reed.  The All-Star forward could be looking at a long distance relationship with girlfriend and model Kendall Jenner, sister of Kim and Khloe Kardashian.  RELATED: Blake Griffin Trade Gets Social Media Talking, And He Even Gets In A Classic Comment  Between the Kardashians’ reality show and paparazzi buzzing around, could there really be a Kardashian curse?  Kim and Khloe both married and divorced NBA players who saw better days on the court before marrying into the family, thrusting their lives into the spotlight.  Fan favorite Lamar Odom was traded from the Lakers to the Dallas Mavericks in 2011. His career then went downhill and then he almost died of a drug overdose while married to Khloe.  Kim was married to New Jersey Nets player Kris Humphries for just 72 days. He has played for four different NBA teams since the well-documented brief marriage.","In 2015, Oklahoma City Thunder point guard Russell Westbrook married Nina Earl, who played basketball at UCLA. They have a child together, but she has not been able to avoid the curse.  Westbrook’s play has declined since marrying, and he is now averaging a career-low 24.2 points per game.  The 28-year-old Griffin, who was selected first overall by the Clippers in 2009, has been injury-prone throughout his career. He has suffered several injuries including a broken kneecap and a partially torn quad.  Griffin has averaged 21.5 points, 9.4 rebounds and 4.2 assists per game in his career.  His relationship with Jenner, who has been a part of the Kardashian clan for several years, has been closely watched.  This trade, along with the other NBA trades, certainly raises questions about the impact of a Kardashian relationship on a player’s career.  The Kardashians have certainly been known to create a media frenzy around their personal lives, which can be a distraction for their partners.  It will be interesting to see how Griffin’s career fares in Detroit and whether he can avoid the supposed curse.

Here's a paraphrased version of the passage:

Blake Griffin, a former Clippers player, has been traded to the Detroit Pistons due to his history of injuries. This trade has sparked discussion about the potential impact of his relationship with Kendall Jenner, a member of the Kardashian family, on his career. The Pistons will also acquire draft picks in the trade, while the Clippers will receive Tobias Harris, Avery Bradley, and Boban Marjanovic. The trade has raised questions about the so-called ""Kardashian curse,"" which suggests that dating a Kardashian can lead to a decline in an athlete's performance. This theory is supported by the experiences of athletes such as Lamar Odom and Kris Humphries, who saw a decline in their careers after marrying into the Kardashian family. Griffin's relationship with Jenner has been closely watched, and it remains to be seen how his career will fare in Detroit."

It is easy to bet and win big with Kagwirawo. Click here  Selena underwent a life saving kidney transplant in the summer of 2017. That seemed to make her realize that Justin was worth giving another chance as by late October, she broke up with boyfriend of 10 months The Weeknd, 28, and was back in the “Sorry” singer’s arms. “Selena’s priorities drastically changed after her surgery and her perspective on life has shifted. She was looking to settle down sooner than Justin wanted to and she took his reluctance as the last straw to finally move on from him,” our insider adds.  Sel has fans thinking that she still has Bieber on the brain with the release of her new song “Back To You” on May 10. Its her first single in 2018 and her first new music since her make up and break up with Justin. It included lyrics such as “Let a couple years water down how I’m feeling about you” and “Everybody knows we got unfinished business,” which Selenators immediately assumed was about Justin. The chorus went “What was there wasn’t sure. But I’d go back to you. I know I’d go back to you.” Well, she won’t go back Justin unless he’s ready to think about putting a ring on it!

When asked by Morgan if there will ever be more Sex and the City, Cattral said, “Not for me. That was part of turning 60. That was a very clear moment of how many years do I have left and what do I want to do with it? What haven’t I done? I feel that the show was the best when it was the series and the bonus was the two movies.”","Cattrall, who played Samantha Jones, also said she was never close to her Sex and the City co-stars, Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis.  “I think there’s a certain part of all of us that will always feel like we’re part of that show and that’s a very special feeling. But I don’t, in any way, feel like I’m part of a gang or a club. I never have. I’ve always been a bit of a lone wolf.”  In the interview, Cattrall also said she felt that her character, Samantha Jones, was often portrayed as a “fifth wheel” in the show.  “I think the show was very much about the four of us and I think, in a way, Samantha was a fifth wheel. I think that was part of what made her so interesting. She was the outsider. She was the one who challenged the norms and I think that’s what made her so appealing to people.

In an October 2017 interview with Piers Morgan, actress Kim Cattrall expressed her lack of interest in reprising her role as Samantha Jones in any future Sex and the City movies. She clarified that she has no plans to return to the franchise and that her decision was influenced by her age and desire to focus on other projects.

She described herself as a ""lone wolf"" and stated that her character, Samantha, was often portrayed as an outsider, which added to her appeal.

New Idea claims that the Legally Blonde star is unhappy with her Australian, Big Little Lies co-star’s failure to promote the HBO series in the run-up to its debut in February, claiming that Nicole used too much of her airtime to discuss her latest Hollywood hit, Lion.  “Reese is furious that Nicole hasn’t done more to support Big Little Lies. All she talked about in the interviews was Lion. Had Reese known that Nicole would put the show so far on the back-burner, she would have cast some random person in the show,” Daily Mail quoted a source as saying.  Red carpet roundup: Golden girls at Oscars 2017  In Australia, Big Little Lies‘ debut outranked any HBO series broadcast on Foxtel in a launch week, more than doubling the audience that tuned in to see Game of Thrones‘ first-ever episode.  But New Idea suggests that it’s the underwhelming reception in her own home country that has left Reese disappointed. Reese is one of the executive producers for the show after all.  According to the publication, frosty relations between the pair manifested themselves at the Oscars last month. “You could cut the tension with a knife at the Oscars. Nicole was telling her people to keep Reese away from her,” claimed the source.  News of the pair being involved in “some tense arguments” during filming were also reported by the publication, which alleged that the Hollywood heavyweights may never work together again.  An insider claimed, “If the show doesn’t make any waves or get better ratings, it will probably mark the end of Reese and Nicole’s joint ventures.”  However, a representative of Daily Mail Australia says the story is completely incorrect. “Everyone is thrilled to the back teeth with Big Little Lies. They’re (Reese and Nicole) great friends, they love each other and they love the way each other works.”  Another source has denied New Idea’s claims that Nicole had not been promoting the show as much as fellow cast members, saying that the 49-year-old did a ‘shed load’ of publicity both in America and abroad. The report comes just two months after she spoke about the actresses’ friendship in California. “We’re very, very close friends. We’re able to talk about everything,” she said.

She has received an Academy Award, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, and three Golden Globe Awards, and has been cited as Hollywood's highest-paid actress. Jolie made her screen debut as a child alongside her father, Jon Voight, in Lookin' to Get Out (1982). Her film career began in earnest a decade later with the low-budget production Cyborg 2 (1993), followed by her first leading role in a major film, Hackers (1995). She starred in the critically acclaimed biographical cable films George Wallace (1997) and Gia (1998), and won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the drama Girl, Interrupted (1999). Jolie's starring role as the video game heroine Lara Croft in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) established her as a leading Hollywood actress. She continued her successful action-star career with Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), Wanted (2008), and Salt (2010), and received critical acclaim for her performances in the dramas A Mighty Heart (2007) and Changeling (2008), which earned her a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actress. Her biggest commercial success came with the fantasy picture Maleficent (2014). In the 2010s, Jolie expanded her career into directing, screenwriting, and producing, with In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011), Unbroken (2014), By the Sea (2015), and First They Killed My Father (2017). In addition to her film career, Jolie is noted for her humanitarian efforts, for which she has received a Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award and an honorary damehood of the Order of St Michael and St George (DCMG), among other honors. She promotes various causes, including conservation, education, and women's rights, and is most noted for her advocacy on behalf of refugees as a Special Envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). As a public figure, Jolie has been cited as one of the most influential and powerful people in the American entertainment industry. For a number of years, she was cited as the world's most beautiful woman by various media outlets, and her personal life is the subject of wide publicity. Divorced from actors Jonny Lee Miller and Billy Bob Thornton, she separated from her third husband, actor Brad Pitt, in September 2016. They have six children together, three of whom were adopted internationally. Early life and family Born in Los Angeles, California, Jolie is the daughter of actors Jon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand.

Jolie first attended Beverly Hills High School, ","Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001), but their relationship again deteriorated, possibly due to Jolie's unhappiness with Voight's participation in the film, and her father's allegations of her being ""self-destructive,"" a claim Jolie has denied.[24] Jolie has stated that her father's infidelity had contributed to her mother's instability, and that her mother had developed a serious drinking problem.[25] Her mother died at 56 from ovarian cancer, on January 27, 2007, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, while Jolie, who had been estranged from her mother for several years, was filming Mr. & Mrs. Smith in Canada.[26] In 2002, Jolie's father accused her of slander after she described him as a ""danger"" to her children in a 60 Minutes interview.[27] Jolie has also stated that her mother had been sexually assaulted by her grandfather, businessman Howard G. Tomb, who died in 199 Tomb's wife, Jolie's great-grandmother, later revealed to a family member that she had also been a victim of his abuse.[28] In 2010, Jolie became a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, an independent, bipartisan think tank that specializes in U.S. foreign policy and international affairs. In her teen years, Jolie had a difficult relationship with her father, Jon Voight. She has stated that her mother, Marcheline Bertrand, had a difficult time raising her and her brother, James Haven, after their father left the family when Jolie was less than a year old.

Joe Jonas looks like he’s having a blast on the beach! The 28-year-old was spotted surrounded by a group of bikini-clad women on Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia on Feb. 22 — but none of which were Sophie Turner. Don’t worry, though! The girls were just fans of the DNCE frontman, who graciously posed for photos with them on the sunny shoreline. How sweet!  The “Cake By The Ocean” singer went Down Under to shoot the upcoming season of The Voice Australia, which he will be a celebrity coach on, alongside Delta Goodrem, Kelly Rowland, and Boy George. While his fiancée didn’t make the trip, the couple were able to spend some quality time together before Joe’s excursion to the Southern Hemisphere. Earlier this month, the pair enjoyed a romantic getaway to a private island in the Maldives, and then followed up the vacation with a huge celebration in New York City for Sophie’s 22nd birthday on Feb. 21. Joe’s brother Nick Jonas even commemorated the occasion by giving a sweet shout-out to the birthday girl. He shared a photo from Sophie and Joe’s engagement party in Nov. 2017, and captioned the pic that also included Kevin and Frankie Jonas, “Happy Birthday @sophiet You’re super cool! We all think so!” Aww, it’s like she’s already part of the family!  You can also bet that the Game Of Thrones star wouldn’t mind her fiancé posing for photos with a bunch of beauties on the beach. On her birthday, Sophie posted a video to her Instagram story jamming out to “22” by Taylor Swift (as any self-respecting 22-year-old would do on their birthday). As you may remember, Tay and Joe used to be a ~thing~ back in 2008. But clearly, that doesn’t phase the X-Men: Apocalypse star in the slightest — nor should it. Taylor has her own Joe (Alwyn) now, and the Josie star has made it clear there’s no bad blood between them. She even came to the singer’s defense when people on Twitter questioned her inclusion in TIME‘s Person of the Year issue in December. Basically Sophie is the best, and we’re sure Joe knows that!

Since 1999 there have been more than 55 published articles about her being pregnant both in and outside the U.S. It was even reported by the Huffington Post that despite the possibility that the U.S would go into war “Jennifer Aniston Pregnant” was still searched more than “are we at war” on Google.  Jennifer did express in early interviews that she wanted to become a mother one day and from then on the world was waiting. The obsession with her character on Friends—and the fact that Rachel did get pregnant—could be the reason why fans kept a close eye on is she or isn’t she in real life. In fact, the roles Jennifer took on in her career often had a direct impact on when and how her pregnancy rumors evolved.  Over time the extremity of the rumors changed, but many of the triggers are the same.

The NY Post even published a story that she was pregnant and that her reps had confirmed it. But they hadn’t.  Last year, while dating Justin, the rumors got more extreme. It was reported she was having twins. And then that she had already given birth. 

Please paraphrase the given passage without using any other words.

Not all women want to have children, and that's perfectly fine. While regular people are pressured by friends and family to get pregnant, celebrities are pressured by the entire world. Nobody has been more publicly pressured than Jennifer Aniston. The world is obsessed with her having a baby! It seems like no one has been reported pregnant more times than Jen. The earliest reports date back to 1999, back when the world first fell in love with her on Friends and she began dating Brad Pitt. Since 1999, there have been more than 55 published articles about her being pregnant both in and outside the U.S. It was even reported by the Huffington Post that despite the possibility that the U.S would go into war ""Jennifer Aniston Pregnant"" was still searched more than ""are we at war"" on Google.  Jennifer did express in early interviews that she wanted to become a mother one day and from then on the world was waiting. The obsession with her character on Friends—and the fact that Rachel did get pregnant—could be the reason why fans kept a close eye on is she or isn’t she in real life. In fact, the roles Jennifer took on in her career often had a direct impact on when and how her pregnancy rumors evolved.  Over time the extremity of the rumors changed, but many of the triggers are the same. Rumors start any time she is wearing a loose shirt or looks ""bloated,"" whenever she is in a new relationship, and whenever that relationship ends. And most importantly, the rumors evolve as she ages. Take a look at almost two decades worth of pregnancy rumors and how they progressed: In 2000, she and Brad were married. Rumors of twins began. Then in 2005, after Brad left her for Angelina Jolie, rumors of a possible pregnancy began to soften the blow of their divorce. In 2010, while she was dating John Mayer, she was reported to be ""secretly pregnant."" In 2014, while engaged to Justin Theroux, the rumors got louder. The NY Post even published a story that she was pregnant and that her reps had confirmed it. But they hadn’t.  Last year, while dating Justin, the rumors got more extreme. It was reported she was having twins. And then that she had already given birth."

Reality TV star Kim Kardashian said she is not actively considering a career in politics but she would not rule out the possibility of running for office. The 37-year-old entrepreneur recently met US President Donald Trump to discuss prison reforms after she spent months working with her legal team in a bid to get Alice Johnson parole.  Following her meeting with the president, Alice, who was sentenced to life in prison without parole in 1997 on money laundering and drug conspiracy charges, was released from Aliceville Correctional Facility in Alabama.  When asked if she would ever run for office, Kardashian told CNN, “I guess never say never. But that’s not going to be like, ‘Kim’s running.’ That’s not where I am.”  The “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” star added she wants to use her celebrity status for the welfare of people.  “I honestly saw that if I could use my platform just to do something for one person, that it opens the conversation for so much more and for other people to want to do the same thing.  “If more people would just put their personal feelings aside and talk about really important issues that have to be discussed, then so much more can get done,” she said.

She had previously visited the White House Correspondents' Dinner with her husband Kanye West.  The meeting between Kardashian and Trump lasted for less than an hour, but it was enough to spark speculation about a potential political future for the reality TV star.  However, Kardashian has made it clear that she has no immediate plans to run for office.  “I don’t think that’s the path for me,” she said.  But, she added, “I do think that people should use their platform for good.”  In the past, Kardashian has used her platform to raise awareness about various social and political issues, including LGBTQ rights, racial injustice, and gun control.  In an interview with CNN, Kardashian said that she believes that people should use their platform to make a positive impact on the world.  She said, “I think that we all have a responsibility to use our platform for good.  And, if we can, to help make a positive change in the world.”  The reality TV star also said that she is not afraid to speak out against injustice, even if it means facing criticism.  “I don’t care if people don’t agree with me.  I don’t care if people criticize me.  I’m going to speak out about things that I believe in and things that I feel are important,” she said.  Kardashian's meeting with Trump was seen as a significant moment in her political activism.  It marked the first time that a reality TV star had met with a sitting US president to discuss prison reforms.  The meeting was also significant because it highlighted the growing influence of celebrities in politics.  In recent years, several celebrities have used their platform to raise awareness about various social and political issues.  Actors like George Clooney, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson have all been involved in various political causes.  Musicians like Kanye West, Beyoncé, and Taylor Swift have also used their platform to speak out about social and political issues.  However, Kardashian's meeting with Trump was not without controversy.  Some critics accused her of using her celebrity status to get special treatment for Alice Johnson.  Others accused her of being a publicity seeker.  But, Kardashian has denied these accusations.  She said that she was motivated by a desire to help Alice Johnson, who had been unfairly imprisoned for over 20 years.  “I didn’t do this for publicity.  I did this because I saw an injustice and I wanted to help,” she said.  In conclusion, Kim Kardashian's meeting with US President Donald Trump highlighted the growing influence of celebrities in politics.  While Kardashian has made it clear that she has no immediate plans to run for office, she has used her platform to raise awareness about various social and political issues.  She believes that people should use their platform for good and to make a positive impact on the world.  Whether or not Kardashian will continue to be involved in politics remains to be seen.  But, one thing is certain – her meeting with Trump has sparked a lot of interest and debate about the role of celebrities in politics."
gossipcop-5077951266,1,0,"The royal wedding is a multi-million dollar affair. Chris Jackson / Getty  The average cost of a wedding for couples in the US and the UK is around $34,000 (£23,700).  Five figures is a huge expense for a one-day affair. That is, unless you're ultra-rich — and especially if you're royalty rich.  Next month, the world will bear witness to the most anticipated royal wedding in years. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are set to be married on May 19 at St. George's Chapel, in Windsor, and will begin a carriage procession immediately after the ceremony. Their reception will take place later on the grounds of Windsor Castle.  Kensington Palace will cover the cost of the wedding, an expense traditionally taken on by the bride's family.  The case was the same for Kate Middleton and Prince William's 2011 royal wedding— the only item Middleton paid for was her six-figure Alexander McQueen dress. Their total wedding celebration cost $34 million (£23.7 million).  Markle and Prince Harry's wedding will reportedly cost in excess of $45.8 million (£32 million), according to Bride Book's estimation. That's over 1,000 more than the average wedding.  The venue is the biggest part of a typical wedding budget for couples in the US and the UK, taking up nearly half of the entire wedding cost. Access to St. George's Chapel — and St. George's Great Hall, where the wedding reception will take place — is free of charge for Markle and Prince Harry. Transportation is also free, thanks to the Queen's fleet of Rolls-Royces, Daimlers, and Bentleys.  The greatest cost for the royal couple? Security. Protecting Markle and Prince Harry, plus thousands of guests and onlookers, will run Kensington Palace a whopping $43 million (£30 million), estimates Bride Book. That includes the cost of snipers, undercover police, military technology, and security drones. The bulk of Kate Middleton and Prince William's wedding budget similarly went to security costs.  Otherwise, Markle and Prince Harry's total wedding spend, including food, cakes, entertainment, wardrobe, and the honeymoon, amounts to about $2.8 million.  Below, check out Bride Book's breakdown of what the royal wedding will cost.","A royal wedding is a very expensive affair, with the upcoming wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle estimated to cost over $45 million.

gossipcop-9362271023,1,0,"(Video provided by Splash News)  The Weeknd instigated his breakup with Selena Gomez, Gossip Cop can confirm. Gomez’s rekindled friendship with Justin Bieber, however, had nothing to do with the rapper’s decision to end his romance with the singer.  As Gossip Cop reported, Gomez and The Weeknd recently split after nearly a year of dating. The pair weren’t seen together much during the summer, though it was later revealed the singer-actress was laying low due to a kidney transplant. Regardless, they still appeared to be going strong in the early fall. Prior to the announcement of their breakup, the status of their relationship was questioned after it emerged Gomez had rekindled her friendship with Bieber. © Gossip Cop (Getty Images)  On Sunday, that speculation swirled as Bieber and Gomez were seen in public and The Weeknd stopped following her friends on social media. That being said, Bieber was allegedly not responsible for the breakup. Rather, it was the challenges of a long-distance relationship, particularly with The Weeknd touring and Gomez’s shooting schedule, that led both the former couple to reconsider their fizzling relationship.  Additionally, contributing to their split, the rapper felt “tied down” in a relationship that had lost its spark. Over time, the pair started talking less frequently on the phone, prompting The Weeknd to end his romance with Gomez, reports TMZ. Despite their breakup, we’re told that the pair are still on good terms and have talked several times since the split.  Predictably, after the rapper ended his relationship with Gomez, Gossip Cop busted the often disproven HollywoodLife for claiming in a made-up report that The Weeknd was “heartbroken” over Gomez reconnecting with Bieber. In the bogus story, the bad blog ridiculously asserted that The Weeknd and Gomez were caught in a “love triangle” with Bieber, but of course, the breakup had nothing to do with and wasn’t caused by the “Love Yourself” singer.  Related slideshow: Meghan Markle hit with baby talk and more tabloid tales debunked","(via Gossip Cop)  Of course, that report was complete nonsense, and Gossip Cop corrected the record with the truth. Now, we can confirm that The Weeknd was the one who ended the relationship with Gomez, and it had nothing to do with Bieber.  There you have it! Now that Gossip Cop has set the record straight, it’s time for fans to move on from this breakup and focus on the good things in life.  At least there’s still music to soothe our souls.  The Weeknd and Selena Gomez have split, and it's not because of Justin Bieber. According to Gossip Cop, the rapper ended the relationship, and it had nothing to do with Gomez rekindling her friendship with Bieber. The long-distance relationship and the couple's dwindling communication were the main factors that led to the breakup. Despite the split, the two are still on good terms and have spoken several times since. HollywoodLife's report that The Weeknd was ""heartbroken"" over Gomez and Bieber's reconnection was completely fabricated. Gossip Cop has confirmed the truth, and now it's time for fans to move on and focus on the positive."

Pitt is an honorary member of the Epidermolysis Bullosa Medical Research Foundation (EBMRF) that is dedicated to raising money and awareness for the rare skin disorder, epidermolysis bullosa.In January, Pitt introduced singer Chris Cornell during a Rock4EB annual charity to support EBMRF.Further, he revealed in a 2013 Esquire Magazine interview that he self-diagnosed himself with a rare disease – prosopagnosia — also known as face blindness. According to the article, ""Brad Pitt won't remember you. If you've met him, he'll have no idea who you are when he meets you again. Even if you've had what he calls ""a real conversation,"" your face will start fading from his memory as soon as you walk away.""It should be noted that being diagnosed with a condition and being self-diagnosed with a condition can be 2 very different diagnoses.Prosopagnosia refers to the inability to recognize familiar people from their face. They may also be unable to recognize other stimuli, such as objects, cars, or animals.People with prosopagnosia typically learn to use non-face cues including voice, walking style and hairstyle to recognize others. The underlying genetic cause of developmental prosopagnosia is not known but familial reports of this condition are consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance.Epidermolysis bullosa (aka 'the worst disease you've never heard of') is a group of devastating, life-threatening genetic skin disorders impacting children that is characterized by skin blisters and erosions all over the body.The most severe form, recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, is characterized by chronic skin blistering, open and painful wounds, joint contractures, esophageal strictures, pseudosyndactyly, corneal abrasions and a shortened life span. Patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa lack functional type VII collagen (C7) owing to mutations in the gene COL7A1 that encodes for C7 and is the main component of anchoring fibrils that attach the dermis to the epidermis.Epidermolysis bullosa patients suffer through intense pain throughout their lives, with no effective treatments available to reduce the severity of their symptoms.","There are currently no FDA-approved treatments or cures for epidermolysis bullosa.  It was rumored that Brad Pitt might have a rare disease, but it turns out that's not the case. However, he is involved with the rare disease community, particularly with epidermolysis bullosa. He's an honorary member of the Epidermolysis Bullosa Medical Research Foundation, which raises money and awareness for the condition. He's also self-diagnosed himself with prosopagnosia, which is a condition where one can't recognize familiar faces. Prosopagnosia is different from being diagnosed with a condition and can be inherited. Epidermolysis bullosa is a group of genetic skin disorders that cause skin blisters and erosions, and can be life-threatening. There are no effective treatments or cures for the condition."
gossipcop-3530569807,1,1,"CLOSE From Trump Tower in New York City, President Trump told reporters that he believed both protesters and counter protesters were to blame for the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. USA TODAY President Trump in Trump Tower. (Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP) Corrections & Clarifications: A previous version of the story included a tweet from a parody account claiming to Jill Biden. NEW YORK CITY – President Trump's argument Tuesday that left wing groups were just as violent as the white supremacists who staged a demonstration in Charlottesville set off a firestorm of criticism from members of his own party – and raised questions about his personal views of racial tensions in the country. Just one day after Trump sought to tamp down on controversy by condemning white supremacists for their role in racially motivated clashes in the Virginia city, the president appeared to return to his highly criticized initial response that many sides were to blame for the weekend violence. ""What about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, alt-right?"" Trump told reporters in a chaotic impromptu press conference at Trump Tower. ""Do they have any semblance of guilt? What about the fact they came charging with clubs in their hands?"" Trump said he couldn't make a condemnation of hate groups earlier because he didn't ""know all the facts"" about an alleged white nationalist who crashed a car into a crowd of protesters, killing one person and wounded 19 others. CLOSE From Trump Tower in New York City, President Trump told reporters that both sides were to blame for the violence that occurred in Charlottesville, Virginia. USA TODAY ""I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct,"" Trump said from Trump Tower in New York, after an event that was intended to be devoted to a new infrastructure executive order. Trump has been especially quick to denounce previous terrorist attacks, including those taking place overseas. Yet he was notably reticent to pinpoint the blame for one on Saturday that involved white supremacists – a point his critics on both sides of the aisle continued to hammer. ""We must be clear. White supremacy is repulsive. This bigotry is counter to all this country stands for. There can be no moral ambiguity,” said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. added: ""There is only one side to be on when a white supremacist mob brutalizes and murders in America.” Several lawmakers were dismayed the president appeared to equate white supremacists with their opponents. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., tweeted: ""Blaming 'both sides' for #Charlottesville?! No. Back to relativism when dealing with KKK, Nazi sympathizers, white supremacists? Just no."" Another Republican, Rep. Charlie Dent from Pennsylvania, said Trump ""must stop the moral equivalency! AGAIN."" Over the weekend, Trump faced heavy criticism from both Republicans and Democrats for chiding ""many sides"" for their role in the violence in Charlottesville on Saturday, a statement many regarded as tepid toward racists. A full two days later, on Monday, Trump at the White House directly condemned the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists and announced the Justice Department would open up a civil rights investigation into the driver of the car that killed Charlottesville resident Heather Heyer. Yet on Tuesday, amid questions about whether Trump meant the words behind his most recent scripted statement, the president called his initial response ""fine"" and blamed the press for being dishonest in its coverage. ""There was no way of making a correct statement that early,"" he said at one point. ""I had to see the facts. Unlike a lot of reporters – I didn't know (prominent white supremacist) David Duke was there. I wanted to see the facts."" For his part, former KKK leader Duke tweeted a thank you to the president after his statement Tuesday – for condemning ""the leftist terrorists"" in Black Lives Matter and Antifa.","of Robert E. Lee in Charlottesville, Virginia, is an attack on culture. USA TODAY ""I think it's very, very important – if you look at what's happening, you have to look at the root cause. And the root cause of one of these (protests) – and you have to give some credit to the other side – is that people are very upset about the way they're being treated,"" Trump said. ""I'm not talking about neo-Nazis and white nationalists because they should be condemned totally."" Defended his chief strategist Steve Bannon, who has been accused of harboring white nationalist views. ""I like Mr. Bannon. He's a friend of mine,"" Trump said. ""But Mr. Bannon came on very late. You know that. I went through 18 people (in the campaign)."" Bannon was Trump's campaign chairman and became a senior White House aide after the election. Distanced himself from the alt-right, a loose network of far-right extremists who have embraced him as their champion. ""I don't want to be associated with them,"" Trump said. ""I don't want to be associated with anything having to do with racism, hatred, bigotry."""

An insider said, 'Kate and Meghan bonded over the men they married. Now they're bonding over being pregnant together.'  While the pregnancies are the subject of plenty of palace buzz, In Touch reveals the duchesses have only shared the news with close family and friends.  For Meghan, the US publication claims the pregnancy is not just a huge joy but an 'enormous relief.'  'She was a nervous wreck about conceiving,' a palace insider says, not only because of her age but 'because it didn't happen with her first husband,' producer Trevor Engelson, from whom she split in 2013 after two years of marriage and nine years as a couple.  In Touch  The pressure to give husband, Prince Harry, children 'felt like a huge weight on Meghan's shoulders,' says the source.  'Everyone expected her to get pregnant immediately.'  Meanwhile Prince William, 36, was 'initially shocked when Kate told him he's going to be a dad again', but now he sees it as a 'happy surprise.'  'He and Kate have always wanted four kids,' the source tells.  And this time around, adds the source, Kate gets to share her pregnancy journey with not only her young sister Pippa, 34, who is due with her first child in a few months, but her new sister-in-law, too.

First, we heard she planned to give birth at home, then they said her security has been running weekly drills to practice their approach to Cedars-Sinai and now there’s a report that Bey wants silence in the delivery room.  According to Naughty Gossip reports:  “Beyoncé likes peace and calm around her. She has zero time for drama and gossip. She likes her inner circle to be soft spoken if they have to talk at all. And you can expect the same will be true when she gives birth to the twins,” sources tell Straight Shuter. “You can only get into her private life if you are invited. She is very guarded and protects her privacy at all cost. She likes to be surrounded with peaceful colors and soft sounds. This will be of utmost importance for her when giving birth.”  This story is almost like opening up a fortune cookie or visiting your average storefront psychic. EVERYBODY knows Beyoncé is private. THAT doesn’t take an exclusive source to figure out.  Silent birth is a real thing though – something that Scientologists practice and Katie Holmes even did when she gave birth to Suri, but as much as Bey loves music we don’t really see her doing a silent birth.  Speaking of Bey’s love of music… Hit the flip for some recently posted pics of her from a Michael Jackson/Prince party.  GettyImages/Instagram","Beyonce wants a peaceful and quiet delivery room when she gives birth to her twins. According to sources, she values privacy and calmness, and wants her inner circle to be soft-spoken. This is not surprising, given Beyonce's private nature. However, it's unclear if she'll opt for a completely silent birth, like some Scientologists practice. Beyonce has been known to love music, so it's possible she'll want some soft tunes playing in the background. Regardless, we'll have to wait and see how she chooses to welcome her twins into the world. In the meantime, check out some photos of Beyonce from a recent Michael Jackson/Prince party."

The photo shoot promises to be Caitlyn's finest hour since she first announced her transition in an interview with ABC’s Diane Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July  Although the Kardashian-Jenner clan is said to be ‘wholly supportive’ of Jenner’s transition, sources close to the family say the prospect of a nude shoot is ‘their worst nightmare’  An insider tells DailyMail.com that the Kardashians learned of the 67-year-old’s plan from her model son Brody, 33.  ‘Brody told them that Caitlyn has planned and booked a full nude photo shoot and they were like, that’s unacceptable, it’s taking things too far,' the source said.  ‘They’re hoping the shoot doesn't come to pass because that would be their worst nightmare. Taking it to that level and unveiling her [new body] with a fully naked photo spread is going way too far.'  Kardashian momager Kris, who is said to have known about Jenner’s surgery in advance, has vowed to stop the shoot from going ahead, according to the insider.  ‘She knew the surgery was inevitable and it was bound to happen,’ said the source. ‘But she says she will do everything in her power to stop the shoot if she can.'  DailyMail.com has approached representatives for Jenner and the Kardashians for comment. Jenner's rep knew nothing about it.  Jenner first announced her transition in an interview with Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July.  The headline-making ‘I am Cait’ shoot was said to have taken the Kardashian clan by surprise at the time and led to tension between Jenner and Kim, 36, as a result.  Nevertheless, the family have been publicly supportive of her decision to transition, which was completed in January according leaked extracts from her memoir.  Jenner wrote of the $20,000 operation: 'The surgery was a success, and I feel not only wonderful but liberated […] I am going to live authentically for the first time in my life.  ‘I am going to have an enthusiasm for life that I have not had in 39 years since the Olympics, almost two thirds of my life.'  But the book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife and step-children.  Sources close to the family told DailyMail.com that Jenner’s ‘unpredictable’ behavior has also played a part in their current estrangement.  The insider said: ‘[The book] is definitely something that she’s wanted to do for a while and it was just a matter of time before she got it done.  ‘But the family were like, it’s probably going to reopen the drama of everything [that has happened].  ‘They were worried because she’s been so unpredictable lately and just trying to get out into the limelight.’  Jenner's book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife  A second leaked extract from the memoir has already proven embarrassing, after Jenner claimed the late Robert Kardashian knew O.J. Simpson was guilty of the murder of his wife Nicole Brown and her friend Ron Goldman.  Kardashian, the father of Kourtney, Khloe, Kim and their brother Rob, was part of Simpson’s defense team during his 1","995 trial and maintained his client’s innocence until his death from cancer in 2003.  Jenner’s claim has been met with disbelief by Kardashian’s family, who say it is untrue and a bid for attention.  The source said: 'The family think it’s ridiculous, they’re like, why would you even bring that up?  ‘It’s just trying to stir up drama and get attention and they don’t want to be a part of it.'  The memoir, which is out later this month, promises to lift the lid on Jenner's life as a woman and her transition.  But it has already caused controversy, with a family source telling DailyMail.com that the Kardashians have been 'blindsided' by the book and feel betrayed by Jenner's decision to include 'private' information about her life with them.  The source said: 'They feel like she's exploiting their story and their lives for her own gain and they're not happy about it.'  The family source added: 'They're worried about what she's going to say in the book and how it will affect them.  They're already upset that she's doing this nude photo shoot and now they're worried about what else she's going to reveal.

At the moment, she wants more privacy. She has family and friends come to her house instead so she has compan","ions. It’s a very personal experience for her.”  On Friday, a source confirmed to PEOPLE that Kylie and her rapper boyfriend, 25, are expecting a baby girl.  “They are so excited,” the insider said. “They can’t wait to welcome their little girl.”  Kylie has yet to publicly confirm her pregnancy, though she has been sharing subtle hints on social media.  “I don’t think Kylie will ever confirm her pregnancy,” a source previously told PEOPLE. “She’s not doing it for attention. She’s just not that type of person.”  A source close to the family also told PEOPLE that Kylie is “super excited” about becoming a mom and is already thinking about her future baby’s wardrobe.  “Kylie has been talking about how she wants her baby to have a designer wardrobe,” the insider said. “She’s been looking at all the top designers, like Gucci and Chanel, and thinking about what would look cute on her baby girl.”  Meanwhile, Khloé has been open about her pregnancy journey, sharing photos and updates on social media.  “I still can’t believe that I’m pregnant,” she wrote on Instagram earlier this month. “It’s a complete miracle that I’m experiencing. I’m so grateful to God for giving me this blessing. ❤️ I’m so excited to meet my baby 🤰🏼.”  With reporting by Aurelie Corinthios and Aili Nahas."

gossipcop-3329043708,1,0,"'Khloe is not a Kardashian': TWO of her father's ex-wives claim he expressed doubts over the paternity of the youngest sister  Father Robert's ex-wives allege he said she wasn't his child  Khloe hits out at wives on Twitter calling them 'disgusting' and 'low'  Mum Kris has admitted to affairs during marriage to late lawyer    More drama erupted for Kim Kardashian and her family, as the ex-wife of her late father today claimed Kim's sister Khloe was not his daughter.    Two of Robert Kardashian's ex-wives have come forward saying he confided in them that he was unsure of the paternity of the now-27-year-old.  Jan Ashley, who married the businessman after Khloe's mother Kris Jenner, said: 'Khloe is not his kid -- he told me that after we got married.'  And Ellen Pierson, 63, who married Robert in 2003 just two months before his death, has also come forward after eight years of silence to 'tell the truth' about the Kardashian family.  Claims: Two of Robert Kardashian's ex-wives have come forward claiming the lawyer told them Khloe Kardashian, left, was not his real daughter, like older sisters Kim and Kourtney  The reality star has hit back at the claims, calling them 'really low'.  In an explosive interview with Star magazine, Ashley said: 'He just kind of looked at me and said [it] like it was a matter of fact. He said ""Well, you know that Khloe's not really a Kardashian, don't you?""    'And I said… ""OK"" and that was it.'  She claims Khloe, who is married to Dallas Mavericks basketballer Lamar Odom, knew she had a different father to her sisters and younger brother Rob.  'Khloe brought it up all the time. She looked nothing like the rest. She was tall, had a different shape, light hair, curly hair. Didn't look anything like the other three children.'  Different: Khloe has often pointed out that she looks nothing like her older sisters and their mother Kris, far right, said once people asked whether she was 'the milkman's child'  Fighting back: Khloe has responded to the claims today on Twitter She said Robert, who is of Armenian descent, had told her that he and Kris were not sleeping together at the time Khloe was conceived. '[But] he never would have considered a DNA test. He loved her very much. Robert did question the fact that Khloe was his,' Ellen said. 'Any normal man would if they knew their wife had cheated on him.' Khloe has responded to the claims today on Twitter.  Daddy's little girl: Robert Kardashian, pictured with Khloe as a child, referred to having four biological children in court documents filed in 1999 She wrote: 'The audacity you have to mention my father’s name like this! Should be ashamed of urself! I let a lot of things slide but this one is really low… YOU ARE DISGUSTING! (yes you know who YOU are).'    High-profile: Robert represented O.J. Simpson in his murder trial in 1994  Kris, 56, recently admitted in her new book that she cheated on Robert during their marriage.  Since Robert's death, Ellen had experienced financial difficulties, filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2010.  The home she and Robert shared in Indian Wells, California, was sold after going into foreclosure in October.  Kris remarried Olympian Bruce Jenner in 1991 and the couple had two daughters, Kendall and Kylie.  Bruce already had four children from two previous marriages: Burt, Casey, Brody, and Brandon.    Khloe is often talking about how she looks nothing like her sisters, and Kris has been quoted as saying people asked her whether she was 'the milkman's daughter' when she was born.    On Khloe's blog in June 2010, she shared a number of pictures of her and the attorney.  She wrote: 'Father’s Day is two days away, so in preparation I wanted to post this photo album (mostly old school pics) dedicated to my dad and to Bruce.

gossipcop-5865271192,1,1,"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired. T","MZ reported in September that Holmes and Foxx had been dating for more than a year, and a source told E! News that they had been seeing each other for four years.  But if the RadarOnline report is true, then it appears that the relationship is over.

Katie Holmes, an actress, and her relationships with her boyfriend, Jamie Foxx, her ex-husband, Tom Cruise, and her daughter, Suri, have been the subject of various reports and rumors. According to RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were planning to get married in a lavish ceremony, with Suri as her bridesmaid. However, the wedding was called off when Holmes realized that Foxx wasn't ready to give up his bachelor ways, including his friendship with his ex-girlfriend, Kristin Grannis. Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, to Leonardo DiCaprio's birthday party, which allegedly upset Holmes. A source told RadarOnline that Foxx balked at signing a prenup with a no-cheating clause, and Holmes noticed a lack of respect in Foxx's behavior. She decided to break up with him to protect herself and her daughter.

Meanwhile, Tom Cruise, Holmes' ex-husband, has supposedly been trying to reconnect with their daughter, Suri, whom he hasn't seen in over five years. According to Hollywood Life, Cruise's Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn't see Suri, but he's now tired of being bossed around by them. He wants to be a part of his daughter's life, but Holmes is hesitant about a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter. Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion. However, the fact that Holmes' publicist denied the Foxx breakup report marks the first official acknowledgment from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship existed between them. The couple reportedly went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, and those close to Holmes believe that she's slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion with Cruise."

Inside he discovers seven cassette tapes recorded by Hannah Baker, his deceased classmate and unrequited love, who committed suicide two weeks earlier. On the tapes, Hannah unfolds an intensely emotional audio diary, detailing why she decided to end her life. It appears each person who receives this package of old-style tapes is fundamentally related to why she killed herself. Clay is not the first to receive the tapes, but there is implied detail as to how he should pass the tapes on after hearing them. There appears to be an order to distribution of the tapes, with an additional copy held by an overseer should the plan go awry. Each tape recording refers to a different person involved in Hannah's life contributing to a reason for her suicide. The tapes refer to both friends and enemies. In season two, months after Hannah's suicide, Clay and the other people mentioned on the tapes, as well as close friends and Hannah's family members, become embroiled in a civil legal battle between Hannah's parents and Liberty High School. Alleging negligence on the part of the school, Hannah's mother pursues her perception of justice, while her reluctance to settle pre-trial and her personal circumstances eventually break up her marriage with Hannah's father.

On Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 82%, based on 42 reviews, with an average rating of 7.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads, ""13 Reasons Why's thought-provoking premise and solid performances are often overwhelmed by its tonally inconsistent and overly sensationalized approach to teenage angst."" On Metacritic, it has a score of 69 out of 100, based on 14 reviews, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"". Many critics praised the show's subject matter and acting, particularly the performances of Minnette and Langford. However, some critics found the show's pacing and tone to be inconsistent.

Controversy [ edit ] 13 Reasons Why generated controversy between audiences and industry reviewers. Some critics argued the series romanticized suicide and could potentially harm vulnerable young viewers. In response to the criticism, Netflix added a warning card and from March 2018, a video that plays at the start of each season warning viewers about its themes. In May 2018, a study found that the show was associated with a significant increase in suicide-related searches on Google, particularly among 13-to-18-year-olds. The study's authors suggested that the show's release may have triggered suicidal thoughts in some viewers. In response to the study, Netflix stated, ""We have always recognized that 13 Reasons Why deals with sensitive and difficult topics, and we have worked hard to ensure that the show is both informative and responsible. We have received positive feedback from many viewers who have found the show to be helpful in sparking important conversations and raising awareness about these difficult issues. We have also heard concerns from some critics and experts who feel that the show may have gone too far in some areas. While many critics have praised the show for its acting, writing, and social commentary, others have criticized it for its handling of sensitive topics. Some have argued that the show romanticizes suicide and may potentially harm vulnerable young viewers. The show's graphic depiction of sexual assault, rape, and suicide has also been criticized for being gratuitous and potentially triggering. In response to these concerns, Netflix added a warning card and a video that plays at the start of each season warning viewers about its themes. In conclusion, the show was well received by both critics and audiences, but generated controversy for its handling of sensitive topics. The show's future seasons will likely continue to generate controversy and discussion as the show continues to explore difficult issues."

Pregnant Kylie Jenner. Pregnant Kylie Jenner. Yet — Kylie Jenner, 20, has not actually confirmed she is pregnant.  For some celebrities, this would not be a big deal — some stars get pregnant and do not say a word, even as “sources” and “insiders” dish to the tabloids, as illustrated above. For someone in the Kardashian-Jenner family, this is especially confusing.  After all, these family members have become international superstars because they share nearly every detail of their lives, even the painful or uncomfortable moments. As a result, people have become inexplicably fascinated by all of them (Kris Jenner, Caitlyn Jenner, Kim Kardashian West, Kourtney Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian and Rob Kardashian), which has fueled their multimillion-dollar franchise of reality shows and sponsorships.  So the decision to keep Kylie’s apparent pregnancy under wraps is very off-brand for the family. This month, speculation will probably hit even more of a fever pitch, as February is the oft-reported due date for her baby, reportedly a girl.  The non-confirmation of the news — reported by the tabloids in September and described as a “happy” surprise for Kylie and her boyfriend, rapper Travis Scott — has sent some fans into a spiral. On Christmas Day, fans melted down when Kylie did not appear on the family’s annual Christmas card. Starting Dec. 1, Kim released a new part of the photo every day, and many expected Kylie’s announcement to be included in the final photo shoot. No dice.  [Kylie Jenner still hasn’t confirmed her pregnancy. On Christmas, fans melted down on social media.]  Meanwhile, people keep searching for information. TMZ posted blurry footage of Kylie’s first public appearance since the fall, although she’s wearing baggy clothes. Kylie recently posed for a magazine shoot, but is strategically holding a baby lamb in front of her. Meanwhile, some think the announcement will be part of an episode of “Keeping Up With the Kardashians,” which wraps its current season in a few weeks: The website HelloGiggles reported Wikipedia briefly listed the season finale title as “We’re Expecting!” (The title is no longer listed on the Wikipedia page.)

The tabloid is reporting that a source is saying that Taylor is the one reaching out to the actor since she feels she is now more mature than she was when they dated back in 2010.  The source said, “Taylor was so young when they dated, she wasn’t ready for a serious relationship, but now she’s showing Jake how much she’s matured. She’s excited to see where things go.”  In 2015, a rumor swirled around saying that the stars were in contact with each other, even though she was dating Calvin Harris at the time.  An unidentified source told Star magazine that, “He said he owed Taylor an apology for how things ended between them. In June, Jake ran into Cara Delevingne at The Graham Norton Show and asked for Taylor’s new number. They’ve kept in touch, albeit secretly, ever since.""  This would all be so ironic since Taylor allegedly wrote the hit song ""We Are Never Getting Back Together"" from her Red album about the relationship after her ex's friend asked her if they were giving their relationship a second chance.  “This guy walks in who is a friend of my ex’s and starts talking about how he’s heard we’re going to get back together.

In the video for the song, the actor who plays the singer's love interest gives her a scarf which many thought to be a clue that revealed the song was about Jake since she had been photographed wearing one of his scarfs while they were dating.  Since Taylor is now single and so is Jake and they both happen to be living in the same city, we don't see how this could be a problem.

During the recent BET awards, it was clear that Jay-Z and Beyonce were not friendly with Kim Kardashian. In fact, Jay-Z barely acknowledged her when he went on stage to accept an award with Kanye West. Since Jay-Z and Kanye West are not only music collaborators but also close friends, it raises the question of whether ""Kimye"" can last. Unfortunately, Kim cannot make Kanye's friends like her. It's up to Kanye to let his friends know that their behavior toward his girlfriend is unacceptable. If they continue to snub her, he may need to distance himself from them until they understand that he and Kim are a package deal. While Jay-Z and Beyonce may have preconceived notions about Kim and the Kardashians, they don't actually know her. If they put aside their judgments, they might even come to like her or at least tolerate her in their group. Ultimately, if a friend is happy with their new partner, it's important not to hate, or they may end up losing a friend."

gossipcop-83953176,1,0,"Remember when Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux announced their split, just a week after Architectural Digest published a story with photos of their gorgeous midcentury Los Angeles home? It wasn’t so bad on the scale of celebrity breakups, but after less than three years of marriage (a lifetime in Hollywood), it was a tabloid downer for a day or two.  In case there are still people busying themselves wondering if Aniston is happy (just a note, she really doesn’t want you to), please stop. According to the latest tabloid reports, she’s doing just fine. She’s reportedly back on the dating scene with two different beaus, per Us Weekly, and her friends are having trouble not talking about it. One man is reportedly a bachelor who recently split from his wife and the other is an “industry creative,” whatever that ever means. Neither of them is an actor.  But there’s no reason to believe we’ll learn more anytime soon. In July of 2016, Aniston wrote a pretty searing op-ed for HuffPost in which she scolded paparazzi that are constantly obsessed with whether she’s in love or having babies.  “For the record, I am not pregnant,” she wrote then. “What I am is fed up. I’m fed up with the sport-like scrutiny and body-shaming that occurs daily under the guise of ‘journalism,’ the ‘First Amendment,’ and ‘celebrity news.’”  O.K., so, Jennifer Aniston is happy. She’s dating. This is great. Now time to leave her alone and talk about the fact that Justin Theroux knows someone in the South of France with a really great hot tub.  Get Vanity Fair’s Cocktail Hour Our essential brief on culture, the news, and more. And it's on the house. E-mail Address Subscribe","Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux announced their split just a week after Architectural Digest published an article featuring their beautiful midcentury home in Los Angeles. Although their breakup wasn't particularly shocking given the short length of their marriage, it was still a topic of discussion in the tabloids for a couple of days. Some people may still be wondering if Aniston is happy, but according to recent reports, she's doing well and has even started dating again. She's been linked to two different men, one who recently got divorced and another who works in the entertainment industry, but neither of them is an actor. It's unlikely that we'll get any more information about her personal life anytime soon, as Aniston has made it clear in the past that she values her privacy and is frustrated with the constant scrutiny she faces from the media. In an op-ed she wrote for HuffPost in 2016, she criticized the paparazzi for their constant obsession with her love life and body, saying that she's fed up with the ""sport-like scrutiny and body-shaming"" that she faces on a daily basis. So, it seems that Aniston is happy and moving on, and it's time for the media to leave her alone and focus on other topics, like Justin Theroux's acquaintance with a hot tub owner in the South of France."

gossipcop-2388806885,1,0,"R. Kelly’s time may have finally come. R. Kelly has been accused of sexual relationships with minors going back to 1994, when he married 15-year-old pop star Aaliyah. (The marriage was annulled.) In the 24 years since then, he has been sued multiple times for inappropriate sexual contact with a minor (he settled out of court every time), and he was eventually charged with creating child pornography. (A jury found him not guilty on the grounds that they could not conclusively identify the other figure in his infamous sex tape as a child.) Last summer, he was accused of creating an abusive “sex cult” of very young women, whom he allegedly isolates, brainwashes, and abuses physically and emotionally. Since the story broke, multiple women have added their own testimonies of abuse at R. Kelly’s hands. (Through a lawyer, Kelly denied all accusations, saying he would “work diligently and forcibly to pursue his accusers and clear his name.”) And in April, another woman accused Kelly of “knowingly and intentionally infecting her with an STD.” Her lawyers say they are currently preparing a federal civil lawsuit. Through a spokesperson, Kelly issued a statement to the Washington Post in which he “categorically denies all claims and allegations.” As man after man has fallen to the #MeToo reckoning, losing jobs and retiring from public life after being accused of sexual harassment and assault, there’s been a recurring whisper: What about R. Kelly? Despite decades of lawsuits and allegations, Kelly’s career has marched steadily on. Last year, he finished an arena tour with a few cancellations. This year, he’s touring with singer Charlie Wilson (some protests are planned). His music appeared in Pitch Perfect 3. At this year’s Coachella, rapper Vince Staples repeatedly referred to Kelly as a “child molester” in an interview with Complex, insisting, “He pees on people.” In our post-#MeToo, post-Time’s Up, post-Harvey Weinstein world, and given the sheer volume of allegations against Kelly, it seems reasonable to raise the question of why he continues to work as much as he does. But Staples’s interviewer only giggled nervously and protested, “We can’t ever talk about this guy. ... You’re about to get me fired from Coachella. It’s my first time here.” Later, Staples tweeted that “R. Kelly people is looking for me.” ladies and gentlemen, vince staples on r kelly pic.twitter.com/SmZdYu9PNJ — andy (@aboynamedandy) April 16, 2018 That stasis may be starting to change. Most of the claims against Kelly were reiterated in a recent BBC Three documentary, R Kelly: Sex, Girls & Videotapes. And over the past year, at least five members of Kelly’s inner circle have left him. His assistant, his accountant, his lawyer, and his rep have all said that they no longer work for him, although none of them have gone into detail about their departures and all have been supportive and complimentary toward Kelly in their statements. His longtime musical accompanist, DJ Phantom, was less circumspect about his decision to leave Kelly in December: “I didn’t know then what I know now,” he said. “He’s a shitbag.” In April, the Women of Color committee within Time’s Up threw its weight behind the #MuteRKelly campaign, calling for anyone currently profiting from Kelly and his music to drop him, including Spotify, Ticketmaster, and Kelly’s record label, RCA. Shortly thereafter, Spotify announced that it would no longer be promoting Kelly’s music, although his music would remain in their streaming catalog. It’s possible that these new developlments mean things are changing for Kelly, and that he’s about to face lasting consequences for those accusations. But if that’s the case, those consequences took more than two decades to reach him. There is a persistent vagueness to the way we talk about R. Kelly that makes it possible to forget exactly what he’s been accused of, how often he’s been accused, and how much proof there is against him. And most likely, that’s because his alleg","by the marriage.” Aaliyah died in a plane crash in 1996. 1996: Kelly accused of sexual assault for the first time In 1996, a 19-year-old woman named Tiffany Hawkins filed a lawsuit against Kelly, alleging that he had sexually assaulted her in his hotel room after a concert in 1995. Hawkins’s lawsuit was reportedly settled out of court for an undisclosed sum. 1998: Another lawsuit, another settlement In 1998, a 20-year-old woman named Patrice Jones accused Kelly of sexual battery and emotional distress. The lawsuit was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum. 2000: Chicago Sun-Times reports on allegations against Kelly In 2000, the Chicago Sun-Times published a lengthy investigation into the allegations against Kelly, including accusations from multiple women of sexual misconduct and statutory rape. One of the women, a 17-year-old high school student, alleged that Kelly had “lured” her into a sexual relationship with him and that he had “frequently” sexually assaulted her. 2001: Aaliyah’s mother speaks out Dannie Hewitt, Aaliyah’s mother, spoke to the Sun-Times about her daughter’s marriage to Kelly. “I knew that they were intimate. I knew that he was very controlling. I knew that she couldn’t do anything without him. I knew that she was totally under his thumb,” she said. 2002: Kelly accused of child pornography In 2002, a video emerged of Kelly allegedly having sex with a 14-year-old girl. The video was sent to the Chicago Police Department, and Kelly was arrested and charged with child pornography. In 2008, a jury found Kelly not guilty, ruling that the video was not conclusive evidence that the girl in question was underage. 2015: Allegations of a “sex cult” emerge In 2015, a woman named Lizzette Martinez told the Daily Beast that she had been a member of Kelly’s “sex cult” for several years. She alleged that Kelly had “groomed” her for a sexual relationship starting when she was 17 years old, and that she had been subjected to physical and emotional abuse. 2017: BuzzFeed reports on “cult” allegations In 2017, BuzzFeed News reported on allegations from several women who accused Kelly of running a “sex cult” that included multiple very young women. One woman, Jerhonda Pace, alleged that she had been forced to have sex with Kelly and that he had also filmed her without her consent. 2018: More allegations, and a #MuteRKelly campaign In April 2018, the #MuteRKelly campaign was launched, calling for a boycott of Kelly’s music and for his record label, RCA, to drop him. The campaign was sparked by a BBC Three documentary, R Kelly: Sex, Girls & Videotapes, which reiterated many of the allegations against Kelly. In response to the campaign, Kelly’s lawyer issued a statement saying that he “categorically denies all claims and allegations.” 2018: New allegations, from a woman who says Kelly infected her with an STD In April 2018, a woman named Faith Rodgers accused Kelly of knowingly and intentionally infecting her with a sexually transmitted disease. Rodgers said that she had met Kelly at a concert in 2017, when she was 19 years old, and that he had pursued a sexual relationship with her.

While being interviewed for Task & Purpose for his new movie “Patriots Day,” Wahlberg went after celebrities who “lined up to denounce Donald Trump is the months and weeks leading up to Election Day.”  “A lot of celebrities did, do, and shouldn’t,” he told the magazine. “You know, it just goes to show you that people aren’t listening to that anyways. They might buy your CD or watch your movie, but you don’t put food on their table. You don’t pay their bills.”  “A lot of Hollywood is living in a bubble,” Wahlberg continued. “They’re pretty out of touch with the common person, the everyday guy out there providing for their family. Me, I’m very aware of the real world. I come from the real world and I exist in the real world. And although I can navigate Hollywood and I love the business and the opportunities it’s afforded me, I also understand what it’s like not to have all that.”  Wahlberg’s point is well taken.

Do you agree?","The actor is set to star in the upcoming film, “Transformers: The Last Knight.”  Surely, he has a lot to say about the film, but the interviewer chose to focus on his political views.  Does this surprise you?  It shouldn’t.  Wahlberg has long been a vocal supporter of law enforcement and the military.  His new movie is a tribute to the victims of the Boston Marathon bombing.  He has always been a patriot.  His comments about Hollywood liberals are right on point.  They need to understand that they are not the voice of the people.

gossipcop-9447768564,1,0,"Justin Bieber’s struggling with his split from Selena Gomez as she’s all smiles on her Australian vacation, a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. Here’s how the Biebs is coping with his time apart from Sel.  Justin Bieber, 24, is going through a tough time as his relationship with Selena Gomez, 25, is on pause. She’s currently on vacation with friends in Sydney, Australia, where she appears to be carefree in this new video. However, a source reveals that the same can’t be said for Bieber. “Justin has Selena on the brain constantly. He is trying to drown it out by hanging with friends and doing stuff on his own time but he keeps thinking about her,” a source EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com. “He always wants to be around her, talk to her and be with her. She is like a drug for him, he just needs more and more and more.”  As the Biebs continues to struggle with their time apart, he’s got a few things up his sleeve for when she returns to LA. “He can’t wait until she is back because he wants to really wine and dine her upon her return and really kick start the relationship back up again,” the insider reveals. It’s unclear when Sel is scheduled to return to the West Coast. But, as seen on her Instagram, she is having the time of her life. She posted a video which showed her laughing on a boat, accompanied by a subliminal message, that she “chose” to take care of herself, “not to prove anything to anyone.” Was she trying to give us insight into her most recent split with Bieber?  Jelena fans went into panic mode after seeing Sel in the arms of another man on a boat on March 19. She was photographed hugging and goofing off in photos with Sydney native, Johnny Rays. While all signs point to a friendship between the two, the photos didn’t appear that way to some fans who claimed they looked too close for comfort.  While Sel has been vacationing Down Under, Bieber has been staying active. He’s been photographed playing hockey and soccer with friends. However, his emotions may be getting the best of him as he took a gnarly fall during a soccer game on March 19, and seemingly broke down on the sidelines of a hockey game on March 17.  As you may recall, Jelena reunited in October 2017, after her split with The Weeknd, 28. They seemed inseparable, having spent New Year’s together in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. However, their romance took a rocky turn around Bieber’s birthday on March 1, according to reports.","A source close to the couple previously revealed to us that the split happened because of Selena’s concerns over Justin’s behavior and friends. “Selena is really upset with Justin. She thinks he’s been acting out of control and it’s not a healthy situation for her to be in,” the source told us EXCLUSIVELY. “She wants to see him get help for his issues and work on himself before they can get back together.”  Despite their current split, a reconciliation is still possible. “Justin still cares deeply for Selena and is hoping that she will take him back once he’s proven that he’s changed,” our source shared.

gossipcop-28284230,1,0,"Not so fast! Madonna was hit with a series of “uncomfortable questions” by a judge before she was granted permission to adopt her 4-year-old twin girls from Malawi, the presiding judge said in court documents obtained by The Associated Press on Wednesday, February 8.  “The petitioner is a professional performer and I guarded myself against the danger of her merely reciting a well-rehearsed speech by asking her some rather uncomfortable questions to which she gave very candid answers,” Judge Fiona Mwale said in her ruling, explaining her reasons for approving the adoption.  After pressing Madonna, 58, to explain her intentions in adding two more little ones to her brood of four, Judge Mwale said she was satisfied that the girls would be in good hands with the Material Girl.  “There is no doubt that the petitioner can offer the infants not only the best education money can buy, but also guidance with a high likelihood of ensuring that the two infants grow to be self-sufficient adults,” Judge Mwale said, adding that she is satisfied that Madonna “is motivated by her desire to offer a home, love, protection and guidance to the infants.”  In the court documents, Judge Mwale addressed prior controversies surrounding Madonna’s adoptions in Malawi. “In determining her motives, I questioned the petitioner at length about the impact of her decision which could be construed as robbing Malawi of its most precious resource, its children,” the judge wrote.  As previously reported, Madonna filed for adoption in High Court in Malawi on January 25 but tried to keep the process under wraps until a final decision was made. (The Queen of Pop issued a statement denying her adoption to Us Weekly that same day, claiming that she was in Malawi “to check on the children’s hospital in Blantyre.”) According to the AP, she has already raised $7.5 million for a pediatric surgery ward at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, which is set to open early next year.  Madonna previously adopted son David and daughter Mercy James, both 11, from Malawi in 2008 and 2009, respectively. She is also mom to daughter Lourdes, 20, whom she shares with ex Carlos Leon, and son Rocco, 16, whom she shares with ex-husband Guy Ritchie.  Madonna’s twin girls will retain their birth names as a part of an effort to preserve their identity as Malawian nationals, the court documents said, and their father was at the January 25 court hearing with Madonna. (The twins’ mother died within a week of childbirth due to health complications.)  On Wednesday, February 8, Madonna took to social media to share the happy news. “I can officially confirm I have completed the process of adopting twin sisters from Malawi and am overjoyed that they are now part of our family,” she captioned an image of herself walking between the two little girls. “I am deeply grateful to all those in Malawi who helped make this possible, and I ask the media please to respect our privacy during this transitional time. 🙏🏻 Thank you also to my friends, family and my very large team for all your support and Love!”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!

The post Madonna Adopts 4-Year-Old Twin Girls From Malawi: Judge Approves Adoption, Calls Singer ‘Motivated By Desire to Offer Love and Guidance’ appeared first on Us Weekly.
No problem! Here's a paraphrased version of the given passage:

Madonna has been granted permission to adopt 4-year-old twin girls from Malawi, according to court documents obtained by The Associated Press. The judge presiding over the case, Fiona Mwale, stated that she asked Madonna a series of uncomfortable questions to ensure that the singer was motivated by a genuine desire to provide a loving home for the children, rather than simply reciting a well-rehearsed speech. Mwale explained that she was satisfied with Madonna's responses and believed that the twins would be well cared for by the Material Girl. The judge also addressed concerns about Madonna's motives, given the controversy surrounding her previous adoptions in Malawi. Madonna has already raised $7.5 million for a pediatric surgery ward at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, which is set to open early next year. The twins' father was present at the January 25 court hearing, and the girls will retain their birth names as a way to preserve their Malawian identity. Madonna shared the news on social media, expressing her gratitude and asking for privacy during this time."

She learned to sing at age 5 and to play the piano at age 7.[3] She made occasional appearances at her father's shows[2] and took vocal lessons from Beyonce's vocal coach, Tim Carter, when she was 14, as well.[3] She also worked in the studio with her brother-in-law (and Good Charlotte lead vocalist) Joel Madden.[4][3] She decided to move away from a music career, however, because of the pressure of living up to her father's stature in the music industry.[5]  Richie spent some time at Oaks Christian School—nicknamed ""Celebrity High""—before being educated at home for several years while her father was on tour. She played soccer until age 16 when she broke her hip in a Segway accident.[5]  Modeling career [ edit ]  Richie began modeling at age 14 with a feature in Teen Vogue[4] and at 15 she got her first fashion contract with Los Angeles-based swimwear company Mary Grace Swim.[6] The next year, Richie signed with London-based modeling agency Select Model Management.[7]  Richie has featured in advertising campaigns for a number of brands including DL1961,[8] Madonna's Material Girl line,[2] Chanel,[9] Dolce & Gabbana,[9] Adidas, Michael Kors,[11] and Tommy Hilfiger.[9] She has done photoshoots for Elle and Vanity Fair[5] and has recently appeared on the cover of Complex[5] and Billboard magazine's style issue.[3]","Personal life [ edit ]  Richie's parents divorced when she was 3 years old, and she saw her father only occasionally until she was 12.

The insider tells OK! “Rob was basically a 24-hour pot smoker back in his Twilight days, but since his relationship with Twigs got serious he's scaled back on all his vices and hardly ever drinks or smokes around other people.”  If Robert drank due to being stressed with the fame of Twilight, we can only imagine what happened after those infamous photos of Kristen Stewart making out with her movie producer boss while they were still together did to him.

Ricky got me good! I was so happy that I couldn’t quit smiling.

But from day one there was open communication with Ricky about what I had gone through. I think one of the reasons I fell in love so quickly is that I could say everything and know I was not being judged.”  Bischoff hasn’t spoken to Soules recently but says she wishes him well. “I hope that he meets someone, if he hasn’t already, just as great for him and Ricky is for me.”  Now, Bischoff still watches The Bachelor, but says she’s moved on from her own reality show past. “That journey was a big part of my life,” she says. “But since I’ve met Ricky, I really haven’t looked back.”  Busy with wedding plans (the couple are looking at a date next fall), Bischoff says she nonetheless has positive associations with the show. “It’s sad that it ended the way it had to end, but I was still looking for that perfect someone. I didn’t let my past close off my heart. Everything works out for a reason.”","While she won’t reveal details of her upcoming wedding, Bischoff says it will be a small, intimate gathering of loved ones. “I don’t want anything too big or overwhelming,” she says. “I want to enjoy every second of it.”  Bischoff’s contentment with her new fiancé and her life outside of the spotlight is clear. “I’m so grateful,” she says. “I feel like I’ve been given a second chance at love and I’m just really, really happy.”"

Now, a new report claims that the Friends star has hired a surrogate, could there be any truth to the story?  In the new issue of Star, the tabloid features the headline, “Jen To Justin: I’ll Raise Our Baby Alone!” followed by a story that asserts Aniston wants to become a mom, and she will do it with or without her husband.

Aniston told Glamour magazine back in August that not only are the pregnancy tabloid stories guilty of body shaming, but they are also an invasion into a private matter between her and her husband.

gossipcop-5840642713,1,0,"Sky high prices are reportedly keeping fans from buying tickets to Taylor Swift’s upcoming Reputation tour, per a story by the New York Post. Though her 1989 world tour boasted numerous sold out performances (it eventually became the highest grossing tour of 2015), it appears her considerably more expensive snake persona is a tougher sell.  Last month, her “longtime” tour promoter told Billboard, “By the time all the tickets are sold next week, I’ll be celebrating Taylor’s birthday with a cocktail in my hand and sold-out concerts all over the world.” But her birthday has come and gone, and not one date has sold out.  Reputation was the biggest-selling album of 2017 and the tour is shaping up to be far from ill-attended, so the Post’s headline, “Taylor Swift’s Reputation tour shaping up to be a disaster,” is a little much. It does, however, highlight the problems with unpredictable pricing, scalpers, and Ticketmaster in general.  The company’s “Verified Fan” program, which they would like you to believe is all about rewarding music lovers, appears to be nothing but a cash grab that takes advantage of Swift-obsessed teens with easy access to their parents’ credit card numbers. People willing to drop $50 on merch, the Post reports, could “improve [their] position in line to purchase tickets.” And, once accessible, the tickets are often too expensive for many fans.  “I paid $150 for my ticket with amazing seats for the 1989 tour,” one fan wrote. “Now for the same seats I have to pay about $500.”  Advertisement  In related news, tickets to Katy Perry’s Friday show in New Orleans are currently starting at $23.","A Swiftie would have to be fairly masochistic to choose to shell out that kind of cash for a T-shirt and a ticket that’s probably not as good as the one they could get for a Katy Perry show. The moral of the story is that, despite Swift’s undeniable talent, her newfound persona is, at the very least, alienating her most loyal fan base."

gossipcop-6225895099,1,0,"Chris Soules, former star of ABC’s “The Bachelor,” after his arrest. (Buchanan County Sheriff via AP) Iowa farmer Chris Soules, a former star on ABC’s “The Bachelor” who charmed reality TV viewers with his small-town life, was arrested this week after police said he fled a crash that killed a fellow farmer. Soules, 35, was charged with leaving the scene of a fatal crash, a class D felony, and could face up to five years in prison if he is convicted. The case has garnered the attention of Soules’s “Bachelor” fans as well as residents of Arlington, Iowa, where he lives, who had come to appreciate the reality TV star’s work as an unofficial Iowa ambassador and farm industry advocate. “This story is going to spread like wildfire around here and probably all over because of who he is,” Mary Jo Brown, Arlington’s city clerk, told the Des Moines Register. “Sometimes fame isn’t your friend.” Soules, who also appeared in “Dancing with the Stars” and “Worst Chefs in America,” called 911 at 8:20 p.m. Monday evening to report that he had rear-ended a tractor on a rural road north of the tiny town of Aurora, about six miles away from his home. The tractor veered into a ditch after being struck by his 2008 Chevrolet Silverado, Soules said. The tractor driver — later identified as 66-year-old Kenneth Mosher, a Vietnam War veteran — was unconscious and not breathing, Soules told the 911 operator, according to audio obtained by local media. The man had a pulse, but there was blood around his mouth, Soules said. Soules identified himself on the call, which lasted nearly six minutes, and sounded frantic. Between heavy breathing, he answered the dispatcher’s questions and took instructions. Soules told the 911 operator he did not know how to perform CPR and could be heard asking unidentified people at the scene if they could perform the lifesaving measure. The call ended abruptly after the operator told Soules law enforcement and medical first responders were on the way. “Can I, can I call you back really quick?” Soules asked the dispatcher. “Yeah, you can call me back,” she says. “Thank you,” Soules responds. Soules left the crash site after emergency responders arrived, but before deputies with the Buchanan County Sheriff’s Office were on the scene, according to authorities. Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Scott Bright told the Des Moines Register that Soules fled the scene on foot and later got into a truck. In police audio obtained by local media, a deputy told a dispatcher that Soules “took off” in a red truck. Authorities are trying to identify who picked up Soules in the truck, Buchanan County Sheriff Bill Wolfgram told the Associated Press. That person could face charges, he said. Alcohol was found at the scene and investigators are trying to determine whose it was and whether it or speed were factors in the crash. Soules was arrested about five hours after the incident and booked into the Buchanan County Jail, the Associated Press reported. He posted a $10,000 bond Tuesday morning and was released on the condition that he surrender his passport and wear an electronic monitor. During his first appearance in court, the Buchanan County assistant attorney told the judge that Soules refused to cooperate with law enforcement after they located him at his home. He “would not come out,” the attorney said, until officials obtained a search warrant, which “took hours.” Chris Soules making his initial court appearance in Buchanan County @KWWL pic.twitter.com/72bvEg0wVR — Elizabeth Amanieh (@EAmaniehKWWL) April 25, 2017 Wolfgram told the Associated Press that investigators were “running into some roadblocks when it comes to getting information” but acknowledged Soules was acting within his constitutional rights. According to court documents, Soules had several run-ins with the law in his early 20s. In 2011, he was charged three times with underage alcohol possession and pleaded guilty and paid a fine for an open container violation, reported the Des Moines R","a Mexican beach. His arrest comes as the show’s popularity soars. The “Bachelor” franchise is now ABC’s top-rated show, with an average of 7.8 million viewers per episode."

ET’s Katie Krause spoke with Brolin at the Hallmark Channel and Hallmark Movies & Mysteries winter Television Critics Association red carpet on Saturday, where he revealed that despite his decades-long romance, he still doesn't have all the answers.  “I don’t know, because nobody trains you,” he said of the secret to his and Streisand's marriage. “This is my third time -- third marriage. I picked difficult situations the first two times, but I think you learn with each one. I’m a person that believes that if I’m wrong, that’s when I learn, and when I’m right, I haven’t learned a thing.”  Noting that he takes his relationship “day to day,” Brolin revealed that he’s an advocate of marriage counseling.  “I do believe in counseling if anybody ever has a problem in their marriage. Bring in a referee, talk it over, and I swear to you, it will dispel by the end of the session, each time!” he said. “Sometimes in a tough marriage, it’s tough to talk, but if you do, it works!”  The 77-year-old actor has also learned to maintain his marriage with Streisand by not interrupting her during hectic times.  “When she’s busy, she’s really focused, and part of our good relationship is that I understand that,” he shared. “And if I come to her with something important and she says, ‘I don’t have time right now,’ she doesn’t have time, period. That’s the way the mind works. You gotta focus.”  As for how Streisand, 75, makes him feel special, Brolin said, “I’m always welcome when I get home. I always get notes, ‘Hurry home!’ When I get there, there’s always something kind of great waiting for me, some plan, and I try to reciprocate.”  RELATED CONTENT:  Barbra Streisand Calls Out Golden Globes for Not Awarding More Female Directors  ‘Girls Trip' Star Tiffany Haddish Says She Taught Barbra Streisand All About Cardi B  Josh Brolin on His Ripped Bod and How He Knew Wife Kathyrn Boyd Was the One (Exclusive)  Related Gallery","James Brolin and Barbra Streisand's Sweetest Moments  Related Video  Barbra Streisand Says She's 'Inspired' by Women's Marches, Talks New Music (Exclusive)"

Up till tpo that moment Crazy Jo-lie had kept Brad far from Jen. Make no mistake about it. Her frantic traveling all over the place was an attempt at keeping Pitt away from her and and any other person who might think they were a friend. She can't stand anyone but her having anything to do with Pitt . Including his own family. I knew it would backfire one day. Brad what took so long????? She suffers from an extreme mental illness. She doesn't have the kids in school for the same reason.  I do believe she thought it would last. Seeing how sexy and pretty she thinks she is. A man should and would do anything she tells them to.  I am under the impression her treatment of her surrogate Holly had a sort of wake up call to Pitt as to how utterly evil she is. You can bet she dismissed her like a piece of shite. A woman who carried twins for her. Started making Brad see her game of using and abusing.  And when Jen said her and Brad talk all the time on the phone you know that was news to little miss do as I say not as I do Angelina still talks to her ex's Jo-LIE.    Guess all the years of trying to force Brad to believe Jen was a shallow no good woman has a way of catching up to one. It took this long for Pitt to see just what had truly happened. Her spells have lost the power to confuse.In Touch said she has a terrible jealous streak and can't stand Brad even looking at a woman SHE DEEMS ATTRACTIVE IN ANY WAY. WE ALL KNOW HOW MUCH FUN THAT CAN BE.    The National Enquirer  Says Brad is so happy to have a separation from her.Brad's closest friends are woman and that drives Angelina nuts she hates sharing him  He was mad she took the salt role because she had promised him she would stay at home and be a mom.  I mean you can see her doing whatever she damn well wanted to. And he went along with it. But they have twin babies and my guess is she spends very little time bonding with them. What woman would not want to be able to stay with her new little babies. Not this woman. Sick behavior for sure. And the only thing keeping Brad from making it final is the kids.  Angie be careful what you wish for. Seems like 6 kids are going to be without a mom and dad in one place. Good luck with that",".  If you have any compassion or empathy for these kids.  Jen and Brad are going to be so much better off without each other. This woman is toxic.  She is poison. And her children will suffer.  I am sure there are plenty of other mom's out there who would give their right arm to have what she has and she treats it like dirt. She is not a woman. She is a monster. And the world is going to see just how sick she is.  And the other side of the story will come out. And we will see what she did to Jen.  It's all going to come out and it won't be pretty.  But until then, we can all speculate.  And I think we all know the truth.  This woman is crazy."
gossipcop-8342414455,1,0,"Forget Wills and Kate's dusty old Norfolk. The lovebirds want to hang out with the groovy set in the Cotswolds - and the local estate agents' eyes are lighting up. There comes a time in every couple's relationship when the question of moving in together becomes impossible to ignore. And when those two lovebirds have been stepping out for 15 months — even though they live 3,500 miles apart; he in the UK, she in Canada — it's not so much a case of 'if' as of 'when' they will settle down. So it comes as no surprise that Prince Harry, 33, and his actress girlfriend Meghan Markle, 36, are said to be house-hunting. £7.25million - North Aston Manor, Oxfordshire: This eight bedroom property, overlooking the stunning Cherwell Valley, has seven reception rooms, a spa, swimming pool and 18.2 acres with equestrian facilities. It's nine miles from Soho Farmhouse and swanky shopping centre Bicester Village, should Meghan fancy snapping up some designer bargains Prince Harry and actress girlfriend Meghan Markle were pictured together at the Invictus Games in Toronto last month Royal sources have exclusively told the Daily Mail that the royal couple are looking in Oxfordshire and are particularly interested in high-end properties tucked away in the rolling Cotswold hills. A good friend of Harry's says the Prince, whose father's residence, Highgrove House, is in the south Cotswolds, has a long-standing affection for the area, while Meghan is said to be entranced by its rustic charm. 'He is searching for a new home in the area,' the friend reveals. 'Before Meghan, he was vaguely looking in Norfolk, but didn't find what he wanted. Now, with her input, he's renewed his search.' £2million - The Old Rectory, Lower Brailes, Oxfordshire: A stunning wood-panelled property dating from the 14th century, this boasts eight bedrooms, a sun-drenched terrace and its own private lake, complete with duck house. There’s a three-bedroom coach house for guests and it’s set at the end of a no-through road. Certainly, the lush green countryside encompassing swathes of Warwickshire, Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire is a huge draw for London-dwellers eager to snap up rural boltholes. Just an hour or so from the capital, it's home (or at least a weekend retreat) to A-listers, politicians and media executives: the Camerons, Beckhams, Kate Moss, Lily Allen and Stella McCartney all have million-pound properties in the area. 'It's like a magnet,' says Sophie Gannon, of Savills Estate Agents in Banbury, Oxfordshire. 'If you get one person, you get them all.' However, Harry isn't following the crowd but listening to his heart. The Cotswolds, and specifically Highgrove, which was bought by his father's private estate in 1980, is where the Prince spent much of his childhood. It was Charles and Diana's weekend home, with 15-acre grounds and, later on, a teenage haven in the cellars of the main house, which Harry nicknamed 'Club H'. £2.95million - Fanthill, Banbury, Oxfordshire: Accessed through electric gates, up a winding driveway, this eight-bedroom house sits among 20 acres of land, so ticks all Harry’s boxes when it comes to privacy. There’s a heated outdoor pool, miniature golf course and a carp lake, where the young lovebirds could row off the private pier A local who knows the family says: 'It's not surprising that Harry would like to live where he feels at home. 'He's lived in the Cotswolds all his life and often returns to visit his father. After his mother died, it became a place of sanctuary. 'When the boys entered their teens, Charles bought several homes in the area, thinking they might want one in the future.' Ten years ago, Charles bought up properties adjacent to his sprawling estate, paying £2 million apiece for nearby manor houses and farm buildings. But sources say rather than living off his father's generosity, Harry wants to invest in a place of his own. £4.25million - Cross Hill House, Adderbury, Oxfordshire: This 10-bedroom house, surrounded by landscaped","the isolation of rural Norfolk. The Cotswolds, with its proximity to the M40 and M4 motorways, offers easy access to both cities.

Paraphrased passage:

Prince Harry and his girlfriend Meghan Markle are house-hunting in the Cotswolds, a region in south-central England known for its picturesque villages, rolling hills, and high-end properties. The couple is said to be looking for a luxurious home with plenty of privacy, and estate agents in the area are excited about the prospect of a royal purchase. The Cotswolds have long been a favorite of the royal family, with Prince Charles owning several properties in the area, including Highgrove House, which was bought in 1980. Prince Harry spent much of his childhood at Highgrove and has a strong attachment to the area. The couple is reportedly looking for a property with at least eight bedrooms, a spa, swimming pool, and equestrian facilities. They are also said to be interested in homes with original features, such as wooden paneling and Tudor architecture. The area is popular with celebrities and politicians, and properties in the region can sell for millions of pounds. Locals have spotted Prince Harry visiting various properties in the area, and it's believed that he wants to invest in a home of his own rather than relying on his father's generosity. Practical considerations, such as easy access to London and Toronto, are also thought to be a factor in the couple's search for a home in the Cotswolds."
gossipcop-2365987922,1,0,"Jenny and her silk pillowcases.  It’s no secret that Jennifer Lopez-at 48-has a body that won’t quit and skin that needs to be studied so we can all age like the goddess she is.  Dramatic? Not even close.  And while a lot of it may be down to great genes, Lopez has revealed in a new interview some of her beauty secrets and yep, they’re as diva as you might expect.  Lopez credits her glow to positive affirmations, revealing she says one in particular to herself every day to keep her radiant, youthful look intact.  So what is this magic phrase?  “I am youthful and timeless at every age,” Lopez says every single day—but it’s not enough to just say the mantra daily, because Lopez also has a handful of pillows with these words and more mantras embroidered into them all over her home. “I tell myself that every day, a few times a day. It sounds like clichéd bullshit, but it’s not: Age is all in your mind. Look at Jane Fonda.”  Lopez continues, “The affirmations are everywhere. I forget that they’re all here. They’re just part of the house now.”  Before you scoff at Lopez’s positivity there is a school of thought that believes negative thoughts can age you. Australian-born Dr Blackburn, a Nobel Prize winner, co-authored The Telomere Effect: A Revolutionary Approach to Living Younger, Healthier, Longer, with anti-aging psychologist Dr Elissa Epel, which investigated the link between telomeres, which protect our chromosomes, and the effect stress, sleep and diet can have on telomeres and how that directly corresponds with our health.  The book asserts there is a correlation between depression and anxiety and shorter telomeres and that “when pessimists develop an aging-related illness, like cancer or heart disease, the illness tends to progress faster.”  And really there's only so far a little highlight can go, step one is all about a positive attitude. Step two is to find yourself a great pillowcase and settle on your new mantra.  So what’s the lesson here? Your inner glow is only a glass half full attitude away.","The affirmations that Jennifer Lopez uses are everywhere in her home and they’re not just a reminder for her but also for everyone else in the house.  The idea is that by focusing on the positives and surrounding yourself with encouragement that you can turn back the clock.  If you’re still not convinced, consider that Lopez looks half her age and then ask yourself if you’d like to look like her when you’re 48.  If the answer is yes, it’s time to start embroidering."

Each time Channing and Jenna head to mediation to discuss the terms of their divorce, “they can’t seem to agree on anything,” says a source. “Their meetings have been contentious.” One big issue: their five-year-old daughter, Everly. “They can’t agree on custody,” a friend tells In Touch exclusively.      Unicorns do exist. A post shared by Channing Tatum (@channingtatum) on May 4, 2018 at 6:40pm PDT      “They’re both working hard to do what’s in the best interest of their daughter, but it’s just taking way longer than they both expected because they can’t agree on the small details.” Another sticking point: Channing’s estimated $60 million fortune. Though Jenna, 37, has had a successful movie and TV career with shows like Supergirl, Channing, 38, has starred in several blockbusters, such as Magic Mike and 21 Jump Street, and was the family’s main breadwinner. “Jenna has told friends that she gave Channing the best years of her life,” says the source, “and now she’s trying to negotiate a very secure future for herself.”  There is a lot at stake financially. During the course of their marriage, the pair acquired several assets, including a $6 million Beverly Hills home and pricey cars including a Tesla and a vintage Chevrolet truck. Finding common ground about dividing their stuff “is not easy,” says the friend. “They both want it to be over with.”          Jenna never thought it would come to this. “She isn’t pleased about how it’s all played out so far,” says the source. “She’s bitter. There are days when she’s blaming him for not working harder to save their marriage.” And while she’s told pals that she hopes they can stay friends, adds the source, deep down “she knows that’s never going to happen.”  Channing shouldn’t underestimate Jenna, says the source: “She’s looking out for herself, and at the end of the day she knows that he’s got to pay.

According to a source, the two have been unable to come to an agreement on the terms of their divorce, particularly when it comes to their five-year-old daughter, Everly.  “They can’t agree on custody,” a friend tells In Touch exclusively. “They’re both working hard to do what’s in the best interest of their daughter, but it’s just taking way longer than they both expected because they can’t agree on the small details.”  Another point of contention is Channing's estimated $60 million fortune. While Jenna has had a successful career in both movies and television, Channing has been the main breadwinner for the family.  “Jenna has told friends that she gave Channing the best years of her life,” says the source, “and now she’s trying to negotiate a very secure future for herself.”  The pair have acquired several assets during their marriage, including a $6 million Beverly Hills home and expensive cars, making dividing their stuff “not easy,” according to the friend.  Jenna is reportedly bitter about how the divorce has played out so far and is looking out for herself.  “She’s not pleased about how it’s all played out so far,” says the source. “She’s bitter. There are days when she’s blaming him for not working harder to save their marriage.”  Despite telling friends that she hopes they can stay friends, deep down “she knows that’s never going to happen.”  For more on this, pick up the latest issue of In Touch — and for more exclusive content sign up for our newsletter."
gossipcop-1550362715,1,0,"In the immortal words of Hilary Duff, “Let’s go back, back to the beginning.” January 2016 played host to a series of Kardashian-Jenner-West-Rose-Chyna feuds that have been years in the making. From “cool pants” to clover emojis, there’s a lot of backstory that needs explaining in order to completely understand everything that went down among Kanye West and Wiz Khalifa and Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna. To keep you informed, Us Weekly has broken it down with a comprehensive timeline of events. Kanye West Dates Amber Rose In 2008, the Grammy-winning rapper started a relationship with unknown model Rose after spotting her in Ludacris’ “What Them Girls Like” music video. The pair had a public two-year romance. Amber Rose Breaks Up With Kanye West In mid-2010, Rose called things off with West. A year after the split, Rose appeared on The Wendy Williams Show, noting, “[Kanye] said that he was an a-hole and he was mean to me and he didn’t treat me the way he was supposed to. I accepted his apology because I feel like he’s remorseful for how he treated me.” Blac Chyna and Tyga Have a Son, Get Engaged Meanwhile, an up-and-coming rapper named Tyga welcomed a baby boy named King Cairo Stevenson with his then-girlfriend, model Blac Chyna, in October 2012. “Most amazing feeling ever. #Blessed #2Kings,” Tyga captioned a Twitter photo cradling his little boy. That December, the couple confirmed they were engaged in an Instagram post featuring Chyna’s giant diamond ring. Kanye West Starts Dating Kim Kardashian Fresh off his split from Rose, West set his sights on his longtime friend and crush Kim Kardashian in early 2012. The pair were spotted out together and Kardashian’s famous family even started pressing the reality star for details on her new romance (remember when he let her borrow his car?!). Kanye West Raps About Wiz Khalifa, Amber Rose As West’s romance with Kardashian blossomed, so did that of his ex Rose and her new rapper fiancé, Wiz Khalifa. In April 2012, West released the song “Cold” in which he rapped, “Only n—a I got respect for is Wiz / And I’ll admit, I had fell in love with Kim around the same time she had fell in love with him.” Amber Rose Marries Wiz Khalifa After Welcoming Son Sebastian In February 2013, Rose and Khalifa had their first child, son Sebastian, announcing the news on Twitter. In July 2013, the couple secretly wed; the next month, they had a big ceremony in which Rose wore a stunning Pnina Tornai for Kleinfeld gown. She didn’t share photos from the private event until their one-year anniversary. North West Is Born Following a difficult pregnancy, Kim gave birth to her daughter, North West, in June 2013. West penned the song “Only One” for his little girl.

As new mom Kim worked hard to get back to her pre-baby weight in time for her wedding to West, she posted selfies in workout clothes with Chyna by her side. Kanye West Marries Kim Kardashian After gracing the cover of Vogue in wedding couture, the A-list couple tied the knot in an elaborate European wedding weekend that began in Paris and ended with an Italian ceremony in May 2014. Rob Kardashian Skips the Wedding, Remains Under the Radar Things got awkward when Kim’s younger brother, Rob Kardashian, left Kim’s wedding festivities early. His exit followed months of erratic behavior: avoiding appearances on the family’s reality series, Keeping Up With the Kardashians, significant weight gain and depression. He’s stayed out of the public eye ever since. “He sent me a long email the morning of [saying] that he was going to leave,” Kim later said on Watch What Happens Live. “There was no fight.” Blac Chyna and Tyga Split In August 2014, the parents called it quits. “They are trying to keep it amicable,” ","ONLY 17 😏,” Kardashian tweeted, referencing Rose’s past as a stripper and Jenner’s age. In response, Rose tweeted, “@khloekardashian I’m not worried about your sister…We are not on the same level…I’m letting you know, don’t get it twisted 😏.” Blac Chyna and Rob Kardashian Start Dating After years of being friendly, Chyna and Rob Kardashian started dating in January 2016. Chyna confirmed the news on Instagram, sharing a photo of her manicured nails resting on Rob’s tattooed arm. The couple quickly got serious, moving in together and even talking babies. Kanye West and Wiz Khalifa Feud The same month that Chyna and Rob started dating, West and Khalifa began feuding on Twitter. It all started when West announced that his new album would be titled Waves, the same name of Khalifa’s 2015 album. Khalifa took to Twitter to express his frustration, writing, “Please don’t take the wave.” West fired back with a series of tweets, including one that read, “You have distracted the kid, everyone wanted to work with the kid because I made it so cool. Now go get ya own waves.” The beef only got bigger from there. Kanye West Calls Out Amber Rose on Twitter West joined the Twitter fray when he tweeted, “A wolf in sheep’s clothing is still a wolf,” which many fans took as a dig at Rose. When a follower asked West if he was talking about his ex, he replied, “I’m not sure what’s going on but 1 thing I know for sure is that my wife is the most amazing woman in the world.” Amber Rose Fires Back at Kanye West In response to West’s tweets, Rose tweeted, “@kanyewest This is my responds to Kanye’s shade. I’m always respectful. pic.twitter.com/uWhlZyp3jI” and included a photo of herself looking unbothered. Kanye West Apologizes to Wiz Khalifa After several days of public feuding, West tweeted an apology to Khalifa. “I apologize for my misunderstanding of your tweets and for my over-reaction,” West wrote. “I’m just glad that we could talk it out and squash the beef. We’re all good.” The same day, West also tweeted an apology to Amber Rose, writing, “My apologies to Amber also. I’m still learning how to communicate correctly.”

gossipcop-9639077061,1,0,"Ivanka Trump is becoming one of the most powerful first children in American History – despite not having an official job in the Trump administration. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) Ivanka Trump’s products weren’t always the hottest items online. In January, for instance, the first daughter’s fashion line ranked No. 550 based on the number of orders from Lyst, the biggest fashion e-commerce website in the world, according to Forbes. That changed dramatically the following month. Sales of Trump’s products skyrocketed in early February, making her Lyst’s 11th most popular brand. The biggest spike, according to Lyst, came on Feb. 9, when sales jumped by 219 percent from the day before. Yes, Feb. 9 — the same day that White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted Trump’s clothing and jewelry line on “Fox & Friends.” “Go buy Ivanka’s stuff is what I would tell you,” Conway said. “I’m going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody.” And viewers did, apparently. Sales of Ivanka Trump’s branded products skyrocketed on Feb. 9, the same day White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted the line on Fox News. (Lyst) Abigail Klem, president of the Ivanka Trump brand, said in a statement that “the beginning of February” shows “the best performing weeks in the history of the brand.” “For several different retailers, Ivanka Trump was a top performer online, and in some of the categories it was the best performance ever,” Klem said. Sarah Tanner, Lyst’s spokeswoman, said increases in sales are usually tied to current events. For instance, interest in pantsuits went up by 460 percent last year because of Hillary Clinton’s affinity for the style, she said. Sales of the first daughter’s products went up by 86 percent in November when her father won the presidential election, according to the company. Conway has come under fire for touting Ivanka Trump's clothing line during a televised interview. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) [A Trump wine boycott backfires spectacularly] But the brand was “largely featured” in the news in February, Tanner said. Conway gave her on-air endorsement of Ivanka Trump’s brand after President Trump had complained on Twitter that his daughter had “been treated so unfairly” by the department store Nordstrom, which dropped her clothing line over slow sales. “It would not be a surprise to us if it resulted in the increase in sales,” Tanner said of Conway’s Fox interview. “I think that’s one of the reasons the brand was largely in the news and could have attributed to this increase.” Conway did not respond to an email requesting comment. Her promotion of the fashion line appeared to violate an ethics rule barring federal employees from using their public office to endorse products and immediately drew criticism from both Democrats and Republicans. [Where does the Ivanka Trump brand go from here?] Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said Conway’s comments were “absolutely wrong, wrong, wrong” and “clearly over the line,” The Washington Post reported. The White House later said that Conway had been “counseled.” But concerns about her comments remain. On Thursday, the government’s top ethics official criticized the White House for not disciplining Conway, The Post’s Drew Harwell reported. Walter M. Shaub Jr., director of the Office of Government Ethics, had urged officials last month to reprimand the White House counsel but was rebuffed. On Thursday he wrote to Stefan C. Passantino, who handles White House ethics issues as the president’s deputy counsel. “When an employee’s conduct violates, disciplinary action serves to deter future misconduct,” Shaub wrote. “Not taking disciplinary action against a senior official under such circumstances risks undermining the ethics program.” [A Trump voter’s message to retailers: ‘Keep your mouths shut about our president’] Last month, a group of law professors filed a professional misconduct complaint against Conway — a","(Lyst does not track those sales.) Macy’s, Dillard’s and Amazon still carry Trump-branded products. Grab Your Wallet’s organizers say they have been successful in getting retailers to drop Trump brands. The group’s Facebook page has more than 172,000 followers. A spokesperson for Nordstrom said the retailer made the decision to drop Ivanka Trump’s line because of “poor sales performance.” The company said it sold through less than 10 percent of its inventory during the fall and holiday seasons. The company has said it will continue to focus on brands that resonate with customers. The retailer, however, has taken heat from Trump supporters who have called for a boycott of the chain. The Grab Your Wallet campaign also has encouraged supporters to shop at retailers that do not carry Trump brands. [Ivanka Trump’s brand is being hurt by her father’s presidency, data shows] In an email, Shannon Coulter, one of the campaign’s organizers, said that while she was pleased with the sales spike that followed Conway’s endorsement, it did not change her view that the brand should be boycotted. “The Ivanka Trump brand is still complicit in profiting off the Trump name and the presidency,” Coulter said. “And by extension, it’s profiting off the harmful policies and actions of this administration.” Despite the surge in sales, the Ivanka Trump brand is not out of the woods. Last week, data analytics firm Slice Intelligence reported that sales of Ivanka Trump’s branded products have been steadily declining since her father’s election. Sales were down 71 percent in January and February compared with the same period last year, the firm found. The brand’s sales began to tank in November, when her father was elected, and have not recovered."

Jennifer Holliday is backing out of performing at Trump's inauguration celebration after receiving backlash from her fans. Kareem Quow for KQ Photography  Holliday, best known for her Tony-winning role in Broadway's ""Dreamgirls,"" faced pressure from her gay, lesbian and black fans when it was announced she would sing at a Thursday concert at Washington's Lincoln Memorial.  Holliday said in a statement Saturday that she apologized for her lapse of judgment, for being uneducated on the issues and causing heartbreak for her fans.  Several prominent entertainers have declined to perform at Trump inaugural festivities. Country star Toby Keith and actor Jon Voigt are in the lineup for Thursday's concert.  Holliday's reversal was first reported by The Wrap; the publication obtained a letter Holliday wrote to her fans. Her representative, Bill Carpenter, confirmed the details in the letter to The Associated Press.  ""My only choice must now be to stand with the LGBT Community and to state unequivocally that I WILL NOT PERFORM FOR THE WELCOME CONCERT OR FOR ANY OF THE INAUGURATION FESTIVITIES!"" she wrote.  ""Please know that I HEAR YOU and I feel your pain. The LGBT Community was mostly responsible for birthing my career and I am deeply indebted to you,"" she added.

The performer, who most recently starred on Broadway in ""The Color Purple,"" said she was hurt by the angry backlash, which included calls to boycott her music. Others called her ""Uncle Tom"" and there was even a suggestion that she take her own life.  ""It just really made my heart drop to my feet,"" Holliday said.

gossipcop-2194660040,1,0,"First Lady Melania Trump claims there is a secret poisoner in the White House and fears her husband is being slowly poisoned with “heavy sedatives” smuggled into his drinks in an attempt to slow him down, control him, and discredit his presidency, according to reports.  While public debate rages about Donald Trump’s health, Melania has told friends and associates that the once robust and high energy man she knew and loved has been replaced with a “slower, damaged version”.  “By 8pm he is slurring,” she said. “This is not the man I know.”  Fearing that the sedatives are being pumped into the body of the POTUS via Coca-Cola that he orders by pressing a button he had installed on the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, Melania has insisted he stop drinking from the tap and instead revert to drinking from cans she brings herself.  “Donald’s heath improved out of sight when he stopped drinking from the tap,” Melania said.  However the First Lady fears the active campaign to poison the president is “a high level operation” and “not the work of a solitary loon.”  Melania is popular in the White House—as she is with the rest of the country—and she has befriended senior intelligence agency staff who remain loyal to president. They have educated her about Ronald Regan’s poisoning by the Deep State after his assassination attempt in 1981. They have also warned her that George W. Bush was reduced to a “brain damaged” state after years of steady poisoning.  But the advantage Trump may hold over his GOP predecessors in the Oval Office is that he has a wife who is wise to the ruse and is insisting he watch his food and drink intake closely for signs of adulteration.  Donald Trump’s food choices say a lot about the man. The president’s Howard Hughes-level pickiness when it comes to food is partly motivated by a desire to avoid being poisoned, according to Melania. He doesn’t trust those around him – and rightfully so.  As President Trump knows all too well, there are enemies of the state dug in deep at the White House.  Reporters from TIME recently got a glimpse behind-the-scenes at the White House, where they reported on what goes down at the president’s dinner table. Of particular interest was a meal enjoyed by the reporters, Trump, and Vice President Pence.  Pence’s meal was not unusual—he ate what everyone else did. But the POTUS received a meal fully customized to his own preferences, and closely observed by Melania who insisted on watching the chef prepare the meal with ingredients she provided herself.","The President does not trust the staff at the White House and fears that they may poison him.  According to a report by Vanity Fair, Trump’s food is prepared by a personal chef, but only if his wife, Melania, is present to oversee the preparation.  Melania Trump is worried that her husband is being slowly poisoned by people in the White House who are trying to discredit his presidency. She thinks that someone is putting heavy sedatives in his drinks, especially in his Coca-Cola, which he orders from a button on his desk. She has told friends and associates that the President is not the same man she knew before and that by 8 pm, he is slurring his words. She has taken steps to make sure he stops drinking from the tap and instead drinks from cans that she brings herself. Melania is well-liked in the White House, and she has befriended senior intelligence agency staff who have warned her about previous attempts to poison presidents, such as Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. She is watching her husband's food and drink intake closely and making sure that he is aware of the potential danger. The President's pickiness when it comes to food is partly due to his desire to avoid being poisoned. The First Lady's efforts may give Trump an advantage over his predecessors, who were not aware of the potential danger."
gossipcop-9067064195,1,0,"Tom Cruise has seemingly been all about his movie career since his high-profile marriage to Katie Holmes met its demise. The action star has steadily starred in film after film, yet has been at the center of several dating rumors.  As the International Business Times reports, “The actor was mistakenly linked to an Australian journalist and then was associated to his Mission: Impossible 6 co-star and Crown actress Vanessa Kirby.”  All rumors until now have been stamped out as false.  However, the latest claims include those stating that members of the Church of Scientology have once again been playing matchmaker for the Top Gun star and that Cruise has reportedly been secretly dating over the past little while. Interestingly enough, Tom has reportedly been using a disguise to enjoy dates with the ladies, much like Katie Holmes did in the initial stages of her romance with Jamie Foxx.  A source told the publication about Cruise’s tactics to keep his love life out of the spotlight.  “Tom’s back on the dating scene, but nobody knows it’s him. His face is way too recognizable for him to stroll into the bars, so he has his makeup artist create a silicone mask. Seems like Tom took his Mission: Impossible role to heart. It’s just what Ethan Hunt would do in the movies.”  It’s also been claimed that the disguise, which includes makeup, takes a full five hours to apply. If this rumor all sounds a little far-fetched, that’s because it is completely untrue, according to Gossip Cop. Tom Cruise does not go through some elaborate process to secretly step out on dates. In fact, there has not been any confirmation that Tom Cruise has dated anyone since Katie Holmes.  Alberto E. Rodriguez / Getty Images  Katie Holmes, however, continues to attempt to keep her romance with Jamie Foxx a secret, despite the fact that the pair has been spotted on numerous occasions over the past year on beach getaways and romantic locales like Paris.

Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx were spotted on another romantic beach getaway https://t.co/ZwdutxFdYe pic.twitter.com/dhoszJ2wg3 — Travel + Leisure (@TravelLeisure) December 19, 2017  Onlookers at the hotel stated that the duo appeared to be quite awkward while Katie kept looking around cautiously. The couple was also seen walking along the beach while Foxx had his arm around the beauty. This report is similar to the one earlier this year that stated Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx were spotted strolling along the beach hand-in-hand in Malibu.","For now, it appears that Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes are both focused on their careers and not on dating, though the rumors will undoubtedly continue to swirl.  Tom Cruise has been heavily concentrating on his acting career since his divorce from Katie Holmes. Despite being connected to several women, he has not publicly confirmed a romantic relationship. It's been claimed that Cruise goes to great lengths to keep his dating life private, including wearing a disguise, but this has been denied by Gossip Cop.

gossipcop-2161541420,1,0,"Kate Hudson Net Worth: Kate Hudson is an American actress who has a net worth of $38 million dollars. Born Kate Garry Hudson on April 19, 1979, in Los Angeles, California, US, she came to prominence in 2001 with her incredible turn in Almost Famous. This role not only made her famous, but it also fetched her a Golden Globe and several nominations, including a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Being a daughter of American actress Goldie Hawn, Hudson bears more than a passing resemblance to her famous mother in both looks and onscreen vivacity. She got the chance to showcase her talent in 1996, when she made her TV debut on Fox's TV series Party of Five (1994-2000). Although she only appeared in one episode titled ""Spring Breaks: Part 1"", this initial experience was enough to uphold her determination to develop a professional acting career in Hollywood. However, it was in 1999 that she started to attract public attention when critics lauded her brilliant portrayal of Cindy in ""200 Cigarettes"", even though the movie itself was a commercial disappointment. Onwards, her career experienced a significant advancement, especially after she managed to obtain a supporting role in ""Gossip"" and ""Dr T and the Women"" which both came up in 2000. While her accolade-worthy performance in Cameron Crowe's Almost Famous indicated that she was set to follow her mother in taking the film industry by storm. In the midst of a whirlwind schedule of fashion shoots and awards shows, she made an appearance in the romantic war drama The Four Feathers in 2002. Turning out to be a box-office failure, Hudson fired back with the surefire hit as she starred opposite quirky heartthrob Matthew McConaughey in the romantic comedy How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003). She continued to establish herself as a fully-fledged actress starring in subsequent productions like Raising Helen (2004), The Skeleton Key (2005), You, Me and Dupree (2006), Fool's Gold (2008) and Bride Wars (2009). As of most recent, she could be seen in the musical comedy-drama television series Glee as Cassandra July.",". $38 million is the current net worth of actress Kate Hudson, who rose to fame in 2001 with her role in Almost Famous. Born in Los Angeles, California, Hudson is the daughter of actress Goldie Hawn, and has followed in her mother's footsteps in the film industry. She began acting on TV in 1996, but her breakthrough role came in 1999 with the film 200 Cigarettes. She continued to gain recognition with roles in Gossip and Dr. T and the Women, but it was her performance in Almost Famous that earned her a Golden Globe and an Academy Award nomination. She has since appeared in several successful films, including How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, Raising Helen, and Fool's Gold. Most recently, she had a role in the TV series Glee."

Matt was a kind and generous colleague who treated me with respect. In fact, a joke I once made on late-night television was just that, because it was completely contrary to our brother-sister relationship. It’s still very upsetting. I really admire the way Savannah [Guthrie] and Hoda [Kotb] and the entire Today show staff have handled a very difficult situation.”  The late-night show joke that Couric refers to is when she said on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen in 2012 that Lauer “pinches me on the ass a lot.” A clip of the comment made the rounds online in the wake of Lauer’s firing.  Couric spent 15 years co-hosting NBC’s Today show with Lauer, 60, but left in May 2006 to anchor the CBS Evening News.  NBC/Getty  Lauer was fired at the end of November by NBC News after the network received a “detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior,” with reason to believe “this may not have been an isolated incident.” Women have also anonymously accused him of sexual harassment and assault in reports published by Variety and The New York Times.  Following his firing, which was announced live on Today by Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb, Lauer addressed the original allegations in a statement.  “There are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions,” he said, in part. “To the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry. As I am writing this, I realize the depth of the damage and disappointment I have left behind at home and at NBC.”  Although her PEOPLE interview is the first time Couric has spoken in detail about Lauer’s exit, she briefly broke her silence about the scandal on social media in December.  In a short response to an Instagram user, who called Couric out for not publicly addressing the scandal, the veteran journalist said, “It’s incredibly upsetting and I will say something when I’m ready to. Thanks for your interest.”  RELATED VIDEO: Women of Hollywood Attend Golden Globes Together in Support of the Time’s Up Movement  The claims against Lauer came as hundreds of women and men — including Rose McGowan, Ashley Judd, Terry Crews and Anthony Rapp — have publicly came forward about alleged sexual misconduct at the hands of powerful men in Hollywood, including Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey.  The movement inspired the new Time’s Up initiative and legal defense fund that was created to help victims of sexual misconduct pursue legal action against their perpetrators. Time’s Up was a major focus at this year’s Golden Globes, where almost all the famous attendees wore black to raise awareness about the cause.  “I think it was really moving to see so many women support each other and demand change, not only for themselves, but for mistreated and marginalized women in all kinds of industries,” Couric tells PEOPLE about Time’s Up. “Clearly we are witnessing a sea change and a long overdue course correction.”  She also said that one of the new of the episodes of her upcoming six-part documentary Nat Geo series will focus on harassment women have experienced in their workplaces.  “One of my Nat Geo episodes explores the various obstacles that are holding women back in Hollywood, Silicon Valley and beyond,” she says. “I just interviewed Elisabeth Moss about this. Harassment is just one part of the equation.”  RELATED VIDEO: Hoda Kotb and ","9 Other TV Co-Hosts Who Have Replaced Matt Lauer  Couric’s documentary, America Inside Out with Katie Couric, premieres April 11 on National Geographic.

In an interview with PEOPLE, Couric said that she had no idea that Lauer was engaging in inappropriate behavior during her time at the Today show, and that the allegations against him are ""completely unacceptable."" She also expressed her admiration for the way that Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb, as well as the rest of the Today show staff, have handled the difficult situation. Couric and Lauer spent 15 years co-hosting the Today show together, but Couric left in 2006 to anchor the CBS Evening News. Lauer was fired by NBC News after the network received a complaint about his inappropriate sexual behavior, and several women have since come forward with allegations of harassment and assault against him.

The loved-up snap is a clear message that their relationship is still on - after claims she was dumped over ""jealousy and drama"" to do with her ex-husband Gavin Rossdale.  ""Blake’s through with Gwen’s neediness and all the drama: her demanding, critical ex-husband and her jealousy of him and other women,"" a source told In Touch Weekly .  “She told him she didn’t want to spend her life in fear of her famous partner cheating on her.""

""Gwen was so used to accompanying him on tour, she was upended. After their nastiest argument ever, Blake took off without even saying goodbye. It was a real breaking point in the relationship.""  Mirror Online has contacted Gwen's representative for comment.  Last year, her ex-husband Gavin revealed that he and Gwen went through ""so much counselling"" in a bid to save their marriage.

But the male player ranked 701 in the world - Dmitry Tursunov - believes he could beat her.  Speaking to US radio station NPR, seven-time Grand Slam champion McEnroe said of former world number one Williams, who has won an Open-era record 23 Grand Slams: ""If she played the men's circuit she'd be, like, 700 in the world.""  He qualified the comments by saying: ""That doesn't mean I don't think Serena is an incredible player, and I suppose anything's possible; maybe at some point a women's tennis player can be better than anybody.""  But he added: ""I just haven't seen that in any other sport, and I haven't seen it in tennis. If she had to just play the men's circuit, it would be an entirely different story.""  Williams later responded on Twitter: ""Dear John, I adore and respect you but please please keep me out of your statements that are not factually based.  ""I've never played anyone ranked ""there"" nor do I have time. Respect me and my privacy as I'm trying to have a baby. Good day sir.""  Williams, 35, won her 23rd Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in January. It later transpired she was pregnant at the time  'She is pregnant, and I'm not'  Tursunov, 34, was once ranked as high as 20th in the world.  The Russian told BBC World Service Sport he did not think McEnroe was ""trying to talk women's tennis down"" but said ""the reality"" was that ""men are stronger in general"".  ""I would hope that I would win against Serena,"" he added.  ""It would be a similar argument to: who would run faster, the fastest woman or the fastest man? Tennis is becoming more and more a physical sport, so it's going to be hard for a woman to beat the men.  ""It's not black and white, there are lots of factors to take into account. Physically I might not be in the best shape of my life but as an overall package I'm much better than my ranking would suggest. She is pregnant, and I'm not.  ""I've never heard John say anything absolutely stupid - he knows his stuff. What he said about her being an incredible player is correct - explosive, powerful and she puts in a lot of work. But I would hope that I would win.""  Battle of the sexes  A crowd of 30,000 watched Billie Jean King take on Bobby Riggs in Houston in 1973  Tennis matches between men and women have occurred before, mostly notably back in 1973 when Billie Jean King took on fellow American Bobby Riggs.  Riggs, the world number one in the 1940s, retired in 1951 and at the age of 55 believed he could beat any of the top female players.  King originally declined to play Riggs and Australian Margaret Court - at the time the top female player in the world - stepped in. Riggs won 6-2 6-1.  But later that year, the top ranked women's player King - 26 years younger than Riggs at 29 - took him on in an exhibition match at the Houston Astrodome and won 6-4 6-3 6-3.  A third 'Battle of the Sexes' match took in 1992 between American former world number one Jimmy Connors, aged 40 at the time, and Czech and American Martina Navratilova, who was 35.  The match took place under special rules to make it more competitive - Connors was allowed only one serve per point, and Navratilova was allowed to hit into half the doubles court. Connors won 7-5 6-2.","It's difficult to directly compare those matches to a hypothetical Williams-Tursunov contest because of the differences in age, fitness and, in the case of the 1973 matches, the technology and conditions.  But the debate continues, with former world number one and 12-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic adding his voice to the discussion.  ""I think it's very hard to say that a woman can beat a man in tennis,"" the Serb told BBC World Service Sport.  ""It's not just about the physical strength and power, but also about the mental strength and the fighting spirit and the will to win.  ""If you look at the statistics and the results, men's tennis is still a lot more competitive and a lot more physically demanding than women's tennis.  ""I don't see anything wrong with saying that. It's just the reality of the situation. ""But of course, you can't discredit the incredible achievements that women's tennis players have had. They are also incredible athletes and incredible champions."""

If you look past all the staring into iPhone screens, those daily delivered box salads and the 'like, seriously' slang, there's some genuinely stirring stuff in there.

Scott and Courtney's frighteningly dysfunctional relationship?  Well, if you've shed the odd tear for the Ks over the years, you aren't alone.  In the family's celebratory Hollywood Reporter cover story, Kendall explained to the magazine that members of the crew can't help sobbing when one of the girls opens up.  Hollywood reporter A post shared by Kendall (@kendalljenner) on Aug 16, 2017 at 8:26am PDT  She said, 'We have such a personal relationship with the crew. When one of us cries on the show usually you'll look around and the camera guy is crying and the producer is crying'  Kim added, 'It really is an intimate relationship. These people see every last thing.'  The crew can go from anything from one iPhone to a 30-strong team, all watching their every move.  THE KARDASHIAN DECADE A post shared by Kourtney Kardashian (@kourtneykardash) on Aug 16, 2017 at 6:39am PDT  Whoever was on set would have also been privy to Kendall's reaction to the politically insensitive Pepsi advert she was must-lambasted for. Though we as a public have received no evidence of how Kendall reacted to the onslaught of criticism (she has deleted all evidence of it on her social media and has never made a statement), Kim explains that Kendall would never let herself be shown on camera crying.  She told the magazine:  We're not perfect, but you see these things in the media, like Kendall and Pepsi, where I see her at home crying, but in the media she looks another way because she's not addressing it. I'm just like, 'This is wrong. You need to speak up.' She was like, 'I don't ever want to show that footage of me crying.' She was trying to not make excuses or be dramatic, but that was what she was going through at the time.  We suppose the only non-family members who know the truth are those blubbering crew members then.","Kris Jenner has also shared her own thoughts on the family's decade-long reality show, admitting to E! News that the journey has been 'emotional'.  She said:  I think we've all grown up a lot. We've been through a lot together. It's been a wild ride.  Kris also acknowledged that the family's dynamic has shifted since the early days of the show, saying:  I think we've all found our own voices and our own places and we all support each other. I think that's what's so great about our family is that we all have different strengths and weaknesses and we all kind of lift each other up.  Kris added:  I think we've all learned to communicate better and work through our differences. I think that's what's so great about our family is that we're all so different and we all have different opinions and we all have different ways of doing things.  It's not always easy, but we've learned to work through it and support each other and I think that's what's so special about our family."

gossipcop-8106461875,1,0,"Absurdly Driven looks at the world of business with a skeptical eye and a firmly rooted tongue in cheek.  People are always saying unflattering things about you.  Even if you're the Pope.  The only time it can affect you, however, is when you hear about it.  Or, worse, if someone makes the unpleasant comment directly to you.  Which brings us, quite naturally, to Twitter.  Here's a place that's just too perfect for the nasty, uncontrolled insult.  You can hide behind your egg and toss Bons-Molotovs at anyone you choose.  Some people choose Kim Kardashian.  She's an easy target.  Her life seems effortless. She's painfully wealthy, with a TV show, branded products left and right and an appearance fee surely only rivaled by Hillary Clinton.  Hers is such a cushy life that she can listen to Kanye West any time she wants.  Small wonder, then, that a Twitter user called Kevin James offered a wry dig at her countenance.  Is it me, or is @KimKardashian Sooo Self-absorbed.. even when she's saying Nothing.. lol.. & I Like the Kardashians #KUWTK -- Kevin James (@kevinjames4good) January 22, 2018  If you've ever been attacked on Twitter, you have choices.  You can reply aggressively. This is rarely worth it with a troll.  You can ignore it and even block the person who directed their bile your way.  You can wait for your own fans to descend upon this poor individual and shred him from tweet to tweet.  Or, you can be splendidly disarming.  This last path was the one taken by Kardashian.  No it's not you, I totally am! https://t.co/9ZxgPyVkko -- Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) January 22, 2018  Not everyone can pull this off with a straight face.  But here, Kardashian showed she understood the emotional essence of her interlocutor.  His biggest problem was surely that he isn't Kim Kardashian.  So she brought him onto her side with something so blessedly charming that it not only made her seem entirely self-aware -- rather than merely self-absorbed -- but also must have enticed a chuckle from Kevin James himself.  Indeed, it incited James to respond with quite considered contrition.  @KimKardashian Listen: altho my tweet came across ""seemingly"" disrespectful, it was just a thought/tweet worthy reaction.. lol... No DisRespect.. .. & I Appreciate ur Sense of humor, & @cassbrunelle14 for calling me out.. lol.. props to the Kardashian Empire -- Kevin James (@kevinjames4good) January 22, 2018  And so, without a word of insult, without so much as a miffed gesture, Kardashian took a situation that could have been emotionally straining and turned it into one the most pleasant feelings we have: laughter.  We'd all love to have that skill.  On truly good days, we find it.  On most other days, we walk away from a tense situation and only then do we start kicking ourselves that we didn't react a different way.  Harnessing it surely takes practice. A lot of practice.

gossipcop-211703249,1,0,"His sweet escape. Blake Shelton credits Gwen Stefani for getting him back on his feet following his divorce from Miranda Lambert. The country superstar opened up about his romance with the No Doubt frontwoman in a new interview with Billboard magazine.  As previously reported, Shelton told Stefani that he was splitting from Lambert during a meeting with their Voice coworkers. The “Misery” singer, who was new to the team at the time, got emotional.  “I won’t forget that day. I looked over at Gwen — who I didn’t really know — and she had these huge tears in her eyes. I thought, ‘Wow, she feels super bad for me!’” Shelton recalled. “She didn’t tell me much, because we didn’t know each other at the time, but she said, ‘I’m going through something very similar to what you’re going through. I understand. And I hate it.’”  Stefani was dealing with her own breakup at the time with Gavin Rossdale. (As Us Weekly exclusively revealed, the Bush rocker was cheating on her with their children’s nanny, Mindy Mann.) They announced they were ending their 13-year marriage in August 2015, one month after Shelton and Lambert announced they were divorcing after four years.  The “Came Here to Forget” singer and Stefani leaned on each other for support during the difficult time. The closer they got, the more Shelton saw Stefani in a new light.  “That’s kind of how our friendship and bond started, that day. It went from that, to checking in on each other once a week through email — ‘This s–t happened to me, what happened to you?’ — to maybe three times a week, then every day, to ‘Hey, here’s my phone number if you ever want to text,’” Shelton told Billboard. “Next thing I know, I wake up and she’s all I care about, and I’m ­wondering if she feels the same about me.”  “Gwen saved my life,” he added. “Who else on earth could understand going through a high-profile divorce from another musician? You can’t even imagine the similarities in our divorces.”  The two teamed up professionally too. Shelton included their collaborative track, “Go Ahead and Break My Heart,” on his 12th studio album, If I’m Honest.  “When we recorded the vocals for some of these songs, I was only six months removed from when all the crap went down,” Shelton said of his split from Lambert. “When you have a broken heart — at least, when I do — you got to get it out of your system. You want people to sympathize with you. I was at rock bottom, in the middle of hell.”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!

Amidst new rumors that Blake is having trouble in his relationship with Gwen Stefani, 47, an insider tells InTouch that Miranda wants to confront her ex to finally get closure. “It needs to be done,” the source tells the mag. “There’s still a lot of unfinished business between [Miranda] and Blake. She needs to look straight into Blake’s eyes, ask certain questions, and get answers.”  There are no plans set for this meeting to actually take place just yet, but the mag claims that if it does happen, Miranda plans to go in with a “clear head,” although that might not be so easy. “This could get heated,” the insider admits. “As soon as the emotions come up, [Miranda] may lose it.” This doesn’t mean the 33-year-old wants to get back together with her ex, though — actually, it’s just the opposite. She’s very happy with her man, Anderson East, 29, but feels a face-to-face with Blake is what she needs to fully be ready to commit to another relationship, according to the source.  “She feels that [she and Blake] have both grown so much since their divorce that meeting up is essential for them to have healthy relationships in the future,” InTouch’s insider says. “Who knows, maybe this meeting with Blake will have them walk away as friends. Either way, they’ll definitely be in a better place.”  As for the rumored trouble between Blake and Gwen, we’re going to take that report (from OK! magazine) with a grain of salt. After all, they were just spotted looking totally in love on Aug. 20! Plus, HollywoodLife.com has heard EXCLUSIVELY that they already have plans for a fun Labor Day together, so hopefully he’ll pop back up on her social media this weekend!

It was like she barely registered he was there,’ says an eyewitness who spotted them out in LA.  In a blow to Kris’ ego, it’s believed that Corey, Justin Bieber’s former road manager, initiated their break-up.  ‘She had been nagging him about a number of things for a while, including the fact that he wasn’t spending as much time with her as she’d like, and he just couldn’t take it anymore,' says Star’s source, who adds that Kris is devastated.  ‘She can’t stand to be alone. But I suspect she and Corey may have actually put on a united front in public for some time, since ratings have been way down for Keeping Up With The Kardashians. Kris is obsessed with maintaining the impression that everything is wonderful.","Kris Jenner and Corey Gamble haven't been seen together in public since Valentine's Day, and even then, they didn't appear to be very affectionate towards each other. According to an eyewitness who saw them out in Los Angeles, Corey seemed to be following Kris around, carrying her handbag, and Kris barely acknowledged his presence. It's believed that Corey, who previously worked as Justin Bieber's road manager, was the one who initiated the break-up. A source close to the couple states that Kris had been nagging Corey about various things, including the fact that he wasn't spending enough time with her, and he eventually had enough. The source also states that Kris is devastated by the break-up and can't stand to be alone, but she may have been trying to maintain a united front in public for the sake of her reality TV show's ratings, which have been declining."

gossipcop-5658990975,1,0,"Daniel Craig is returning as James Bond once again, even as he reportedly fights to save his marriage to Rachel Weisz at the same time. Craig has already announced his intent to return as 007 in the franchise’s 25th film, and according to the National Enquirer, he’s still struggling to salvage what’s left of his marriage.  The Enquirer’s source claimed at the beginning of 2017, “Rachel and Daniel haven’t been happy for a while, and nearly called it quits last year.” The report claims that the married couple was in two separate filming locations at the beginning of the year, but continued to stay apart even after wrapping their respective films. The Enquirer then claims that they finally reunited in July after not being seen together in ‘554 days’.  According to the sources, the minute the outlet attempted to lock down an exclusive on the couple’s rocky marriage, both Rachel Weisz and Daniel Craig were seen arriving at New York’s Public Theater the next day, prompting the source to add, “The whole thing just seemed like too much of a coincidence. I don’t buy it for a minute.”  When you consider Daniel Craig’s own words, especially in the context of allegedly turning down a $150 million payday to star in two more James Bond films, he had stated, “Being on your own would be sad, sick, and weird. I don’t trust myself. I need that balance.” If these reports are to be believed, then Daniel Craig previously turned down starring in more Bond films to spend time with his family, but now – all of a sudden – he’s back to working on James Bond?  Either the report was never accurate to begin with, or he’s giving up on his marriage to Rachel Weisz. One would hope that the two have worked out whatever was troubling them in the first place, but given their own relationship and marriage histories – and how they’ve both jumped ship on long-term relationships at the drop of a hat – one wouldn’t be faulted for assuming that they are on their way to getting a divorce.  What do you guys think? Are Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz having marriage troubles, and is Daniel’s decision to take on the role of 007 again an indication that he’s giving up on his marriage? Or just a chance to have more career stability and/or cash in on a major paycheck? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.  Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images for Sony Pictures",.
gossipcop-4774142356,1,0,"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired. T",MZ reported in September 2017 that Holmes had indeed become a “free agent” after the five-year mark passed in August.

Childhood pal Ninaki Priddy opened up about Prince Harry's fiancée, claiming her desire to be famous outweighed her commitment to her marriage to film producer Trevor Engelson.  Meghan married her ex back in 2011 on a Jamaican beach. They split two years later after she landed her role in Suits, which filmed in Toronto. Previously it was thought the pair grew apart after Meghan spent months filming in Canada and her beau was based in LA.  Ninaki says otherwise.  (Image: Getty Images North America)  (Image: REX/Shutterstock)  ""The way she handled it, Trevor definitely had the rug pulled out from under him. He was hurt,"" she said, explaining that while Trevor was heartbroken, Meghan was less affected,"" she told Mail Online.  Prior to their split, Ninaki - who was maid of honour at the wedding - said the pair doted on each other and Trevor would have done anything for the actress.  ""Then, after the wedding, it was like a light switched off. There’s Meghan before fame and Meghan after fame. After three seasons of Suits, she called me to say the marriage was over.  The pair first met aged two at Hollywood’s private Little Red School House before they went to the Immaculate Heart girls’ high school in Los Angeles at the age of 11.  Following a close friendship that she describes as 'sisterly', Ninaki says the pair eventually fell out over how Meghan and ex-husband - who the ex Suits star met when she was just 23 - split.  She explains she went to visit Trevor who was heartbroken over their split, while Meghan seemed less affected.

""We used to imagine her receiving an Oscar. She used to practise announcing herself.""  While talking about her relationship with Harry and her role as a future royal, Ninaki claims Meghan was always very aware of the Royal Family - despite the actress claiming she knew little about Harry when they met.  ""I think it’s a very fanciful dream to believe that you just walk into a Prince Charming.  ""I know the Royal Family was something she found fascinating. She had one of Princess Diana’s books [Diana: Her True Story] on her bookshelf, and even when she was with Trevor she told me she wanted to go and stay in London for at least a month.""  She added: ""I wasn’t shocked or even surprised to hear about Prince Harry. I know she used to love The Princess Diaries — films about a commoner who becomes part of a Royal Family. She was very taken with that idea.""","Meghan and Harry are set to marry on May 19.  (Image: PA)  When approached for comment, Meghan's representatives declined to respond.

But for Victoria Adams, then known as Posh Spice, it turned out to be a key moment in her personal life too.  The video would soon catch the eye of Premier League soccer player David Beckham, who immediately picked out the brunette Spice Girl in her black PVC catsuit and matching gloves.  He declared: “That’s the girl for me and I'm going to get her! She's my idea of perfection.

The pair have also forged a successful brand over their almost 20-year marriage, with Victoria starting a successful fashion label after attempting a less-than-stellar solo music career.  However, it hasn’t all been so rosy. The couple have endured a number of accusations of infidelity on David’s behalf, including from his former personal assistant Rebecca Loos in 2004.  The couple’s former nanny, Abbie Gibson, came forward in 2005 to stay their marriage was a sham, a claim hotly disputed by the Beckhams.

gossipcop-1551062653,1,0,"  George Clooney and his wife, Amal, attend the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. (Alberto Pizzoli/AFP via Getty Images)  Once the ultimate bachelor — and two-time People’s Sexiest Man Alive cover model — George Clooney entered entirely new territory this week.  The Oscar-winning actor and his human-rights-lawyer wife of two years, Amal, announced Tuesday that they are the proud new parents of twins, Ella and Alexander.  Clooney has donned many hats in his life — actor, director, producer and activist, but fatherhood had always seemed far away. Was it the early-onset-salt-and-pepper hair? The coterie of models who found themselves on his arm for fleeting moments over the years? The insistence by tabloids and fellow co-stars that it was time for him to settle down? Maybe. Or perhaps it was the simple fact that Clooney himself said again and again that he would not reproduce. In several interviews. Many, many times. For many, many years.  A first-time father at 56, Clooney was often asked throughout his career whether the single life was his ultimate future. But after proposing marriage to Amal in April 2014 and marrying her that September (as well as sharing wedding photos with People magazine in the United States and Hello magazine in Britain), it seemed as if anything was possible for the man who once said, “I don’t see myself ever having kids.”  But it was a long road to get there. “I don’t have that gene that people have to replicate,” he told People in 2006.  When Esquire asked him why he wasn’t married with kids, he replied, “I haven’t had aspirations in that way, ever.” And as for people who thought it was weird that a man in his 50s was single and childless? “What do you do? Should I go, ‘I got to get me some kids right now!’ and rush out and impregnate someone?”  Clooney seemed to express frustration when asked how he could ever relate to the fathers he occasionally portrays onscreen. His answer: “Well, I’m also not running for president, but I played that role in ‘Ides of March.’ I wasn’t an actual lawyer when I did ‘Michael Clayton,’ and I don’t fire people for a living like I did in ‘Up in the Air.’ ”  “I keep saying I’ll never get married again or have children but people just don’t want to believe me,” Clooney told Britain’s Daily Express just three months before popping the question to his now-wife.  Of course, celebrities are people, too, and it shouldn’t surprise anyone that a man might change his mind around the midcentury mark. And Clooney is certainly not alone in choosing to wait till later in life to welcome a child into the family: Comedian Steve Martin became a father at age 67 in 2012; Elton John was 63 when he had a baby via a surrogate in 2010; and Chris Noth was 53 when he welcomed his only child in 2008.  Perhaps it’s the fact that Clooney always seemed so delightfully and devilishly Clooney-ish that made his bachelordom seem like the only constant in our ever-changing popular culture. But we can rest easy knowing that despite some hesitation about having a family over the years, his sense of humor has remained steady throughout.  “Ella, Alexander and Amal are all healthy, happy and doing fine,” the statement announcing the birth of the twins read. “George is sedated and should recover in a few days.”","It seems that even as a father, Clooney can still deliver a punch line.  George Clooney has been a well-known actor for decades, and during that time he has been asked repeatedly if he plans to get married and have children. He has always said no, he doesn't have the gene to replicate, and he hasn't had aspirations in that way.  But then he met Amal, a human-rights lawyer, and everything changed. They got married in 2014, and now they have twins, a boy named Alexander and a girl named Ella. Clooney is 56, and it's a big change for him, but he's taking it in stride. He's still the same charming, witty guy he's always been, and he's even making jokes about being a new father.  It's not uncommon for people to change their minds about having children, and Clooney is no exception. He's not alone in waiting until later in life to have a family, and he's in good company with other celebrities like Steve Martin, Elton John, and Chris Noth, who all became fathers later in life.  Clooney's always been a bit of a bachelor, and it's hard to imagine him as a father, but he's taking to it well. He's still the same Clooney we know and love, and he's even making jokes about being a new father. It's nice to see him happy and settled, and we wish him and his family all the best."

gossipcop-1289487505,1,0,"After years of overexposure thanks to his star-making turn in Twilight, Robert Pattinson values his privacy.  The actor appears on the September cover of GQ where he explained why he chooses to stay very quiet when it comes to his private life.  “I always think the risk reward is very much weighted in the wrong direction,” Pattinson, 31, said of opening up in interviews. “If I could stay silent, I would.”  Pattinson has been dating singer F.K.A. Twigs since 2014, and recently told Howard Stern they were “kind of” engaged. But when asked by GQ if he was getting married, the actor — who revealed he calls his girlfriend Twigs — responded with a noncommittal “eh.”  Daniel Jackson/GQ  Pattinson said that he went to therapy a few years ago – and his therapist commented that he was good at “talking without saying anything.” He said he uses that skill in all his interviews. The Good Time actor explained that he chooses to stay private so people don’t form ideas about his personality that may later change and label him as dishonest.  RELATED: Celeb Quotes of the Day: Jennifer Lawrence, Emma Stone & More  “I want to be misunderstood,” he told the magazine after declining to talk about anything personal. “People are always changing, and the more you put something down in print, people form opinions and they’re constantly creating who they think you are. If you do something that contradicts that, or if you do something which goes out of that box, then you can look like a liar or something like that.”  FROM PEN: Chrissy Metz on ‘This Is Us’, Crying on Set, and Her Body Positivity  The actor also revealed the great lengths he’d go to during the height of the Twilight whirlwind to a little privacy. He recalled how he would have different cars parked around Los Angeles with a full change of clothes. If he noticed he was being followed by paparazzi, he would pop into the garages, change, and leave in a different car.  He would also try to confuse photographers by having all of his friends order different rides out of restaurants when they were together and sending the cars to different places after trading outfits with one of his friends. Pattinson also recalled riding in trunks several times to hide from the photographers – and once drove around all night when one was tailing him to find out where his new house is.  “There are ways to disappear, like, fairly easily,” he said. “It just involves effort, and most people can’t be bothered to put the effort in.”  Good Time hits theaters August 11.","In a nutshell, Robert Pattinson values his privacy and tries to protect it as much as possible. He's not a fan of discussing his personal life in interviews, and he's developed strategies to avoid being followed by paparazzi. He believes that by not sharing too much about himself, he can avoid being mislabeled or judged. He's willing to go to great lengths to maintain his privacy, even if it means using decoy cars and changing clothes in garages. Pattinson also mentioned that he's been in therapy, which has helped him become skilled at ""talking without saying anything."" He's set to star in the upcoming film Good Time, which hits theaters on August 11."

Sources have told the Daily Star: ""The bookers are really keen to have Caitlyn in the house.  ""They know she’d be TV gold so they’re prepared to break the bank for her. The world has been fascinated by Caitlyn’s story and getting her would push ratings through the roof.""  Well, they're not wrong there.  Caitlyn is no stranger to reality telly – she's starred in Keeping Up With The Kardashians since forevs, and even had her own show I Am Cait – and after proof that the Kardashian/Jenner family feud is still rife, this could be the perfect opportunity for her to set the record straight.  She even recently revealed that she hasn't spoken to Kim Kardashian in a 'very long time'.  ""I love Kimberly, I think she's a wonderful person,"" Caitlyn said on Australia's Today show.  ""But, well, to be honest with you, I really haven't talked to her in a long time. I've kind of let everything calm down. So I kind of stay, you know, I keep my distance. I'm out there trying to make a difference in the world. There's a lot of drama in the Kardashian family.""  And staying loyal to her momager, Kim didn't hold back during a recent interview with Ellen DeGeneres and even implied that Caitlyn was lying about the things she had said about Kris in her memoir.  ""My heart breaks for my mom, you know, because I feel like she’s been through so much and Caitlyn is promoting this book and she’s saying all these things.  ""I don’t think it’s necessary and I just feel like it’s unfair, things aren’t truthful.""

Caitlyn Jenner, a former member of the Kardashian-Jenner family, may join the cast of Celebrity Big Brother, a popular reality TV show. Producers are allegedly willing to pay a large sum of money to have her on the show, which is expected to air later this year. Jenner recently visited London to promote her new autobiography, sparking rumors that she may have met with Celebrity Big Brother executives. Sources claim that the show's producers are eager to have her on the program because her presence would likely boost ratings. Jenner has previous experience with reality TV, having appeared on Keeping Up with the Kardashians and her own show, I Am Cait. The possibility of her joining Celebrity Big Brother comes amidst an ongoing feud between the Kardashian-Jenner family, which could provide an opportunity for Jenner to address the issues. However, it remains to be seen if she will actually participate in the show."
gossipcop-7658353025,1,0,"“A Star Is Born” is that thing we always yearn for but so rarely get to see: a transcendent Hollywood movie. It’s the fourth remake of a story that dates back to 1932, but this one has a look and vibe all its own — rapturous and swooning, but also delicate and intimate and luminous. It’s set in the present day, but in spirit it’s a sophisticated retro ’70s drama built around the uncanny flow of feeling that develops between the movie’s two stars: Bradley Cooper, who plays Jackson Maine, a hard-drinking, bad-ol’-boy redneck rock ‘n’ roller who is still hanging on as a popular attraction but has lost the lust for what he’s doing, and Lady Gaga, in her fetching and accomplished movie-star debut, as Ally, an ingenuous, fresh-faced singer-songwriter who becomes his lover and stage partner before rocketing on her own into the new pop stratosphere. She takes off as he slowly crashes — that’s the soapy tragic “Star Is Born” concept. But what the movie does is to take this fabled melodramatic romantic seesaw and turn it into something indelibly heartfelt and revealing. Cooper directed the movie himself, working from a script he co-wrote with Eric Roth and Will Fetters, and to say that he does a good job would be to understate his accomplishment. As a filmmaker, Bradley Cooper gets right onto the high wire, staging scenes that take their time and play out with a shaggy intimacy that’s shorn of the usual “beats.” The new “Star Is Born” is a total emotional knockout, but it’s also a movie that gets you to believe, at every step, in the complicated rapture of the story it’s telling. More Reviews Venice Film review: 'Isis, Tomorrow. The Lost Souls of Mosul' Telluride Film Review: 'They'll Love Me When I'm Dead' The 1976 version, starring Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson, had some terrific cornball love songs, but they didn’t belong anywhere near the stadium-rock stage, and neither did Streisand, which is part of why the movie came off as borderline ludicrous. It seemed stranded, with a kind of campy sincere ineptitude, between three worlds: Old Hollywood, New Hollywood, and Barbra Streisand rock-princess fantasy. But from the electrifying opening moments of the new version, in which Jackson, boozy and raw, with his sunburned squint and hard-bitten shit-kicker sexiness, takes the stage of a gigantic stadium and launches into a grinding slow rocker that sounds like “Victim of Love”-era Eagles as done by the Allman Brothers, the movie is thrillingly authentic. That’s no minor accomplishment. Hollywood almost never succeeds in nailing the rock world, but “A Star Is Born,” though a love story through and through, is the most lived-in rock ‘n’ roll movie since “Almost Famous.” And that absolute looks right, sounds right, feels right verisimilitude sets the stage for everything that follows. Jackson, who looks to be in his mid-40s, has been around long enough that he now occupies a grey zone between legend and nostalgia. He can still fill an arena full of screaming fans, and his old hits have become classic-rock chestnuts, but his sound and persona have long slipped out of the zeitgeist. His whole outlaw look — the beard and rancher’s hat, the Kristofferson-meets-Skynyrd soused macho twinkle — mark him as a charismatic relic, and the grand irony is this: What that look, and sound, are all about is an era when rock ‘n’ roll strutted its “authenticity,” but now that he’s out of date, Jackson’s authenticity looks more than ever like a showbiz conceit, frozen in amber. It’s a part he’s playing, an image he’s working — and secretly struggling — to keep alive. He’s got a signature ballad that goes “Maybe it’s time to let the old ways die,” and when he wrote it (long ago), he probably didn’t know that he was talking about himself. In the first of many telling jump cuts, the film leaps from his on-stage glory to Jackson slinking into the back of his car, weary and alone, grabbing the bottle of gin he’s got stashed there. He takes a guzzle, and Coop",", looking like Lady Gaga again, the movie reveals that it’s been playing a trick on us. We’ve been so caught up in the bravado of her stage presence that we didn’t realize how naturally, unforcedly, she fits into this world. Ally is no diva; she’s a singer-songwriter who’s been knocking around for years, and she’s got a tough, funny, straight-shooting personality. She’s the real deal, and Jackson knows it right away. It’s a nice touch that, when they do their first duet, Ally has to teach Jackson the chords, but he’s got the soul of the song down pat. The two of them start singing together, and though he’s the star, it’s her voice that soars. “A Star Is Born” is a movie that’s high on the thrill of music, and on the thrill of two people connecting through music. It’s a movie that, in its own shaggy, intuitive way, gets at the essence of what it means to be a performer, and what it means to fall in love with someone who speaks your language. It’s a movie that takes its time, that luxuriates in moments of stillness and silence, and that knows that the most powerful emotions are the ones that don’t need to be shouted from the rooftops. It’s a movie that, in its own sneaky way, gets you to believe in the magic of love and music and the movies. It’s a total emotional knockout, and it’s also a movie that gets you to believe, at every step, in the complicated rapture of the story it’s telling."

Years later, Brad regrets leaving the Friends star for his now-ex Angelina Jolie, a source told In Touch exclusively.  Following his 2016 separation from Angie, Brad sobered up and sought therapy. And now, he’s “in touch with emotions and his true self like never before,” the source says.  Brad Pitt finally opens up about his bitter divorce with Angelina Jolie  And it seems like this self-awareness comes with some great realisations. “He has come to realise that leaving Jen for Angelina was one of the biggest mistakes of his life,” the source adds. “And while he’s not in love with Jen, he realises how much he does love her. Brad keeps telling friends that he’s seeing everything more clearly.”  However, these realisations are obviously far too late.

gossipcop-4241884018,1,0,"In the past, Kanye’s capriciousness has been repeatedly forgiven and, at times, belatedly rewarded with accolades. It is hard to imagine a My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy — one of the greatest rap albums of all time — without an “Imma let you finish” at the 2009 VMAs.  His new album, ye, doesn’t merit any similar mercy.  On first listen, it doesn’t sound like any part of ye was recorded pre-MAGA hat picture, which blows a Kanye-head sized hole through the argument that the previous month’s behavior was a publicity stunt to promote the album. If anything, the album seems like an meek afterthought to the Twitter tirade and dive into right-wing politics. Most of it deals with the repercussions of the storm which came before it, and for the first time in his career, the artist’s personality is overwhelming the art.  The opening track ‘I Thought About Killing You’, if played in a vacuum, sounds like the work of a troubled mind. If a poem like this came from a loved one, it would surely merit discussion about a trip to the therapist. Kanye goes on to deliver cringe-worthy rhymes on issues ranging from Russell Simmons rape allegations to his petrification on realizing that his daughter might one day look like his wife. He teases a few tidbits of The Old Kanye, chopping up beats from Slick Rick and The Edwin Hawkins Singers samples on ‘No Mistakes’, to keep his fans just interested enough. It’s telling that the one standout track, ‘Ghost Town’ is the track on which Kanye lurks in the background, devoting more time on production than on spoken word, and letting John Legend and Kid Cudi take over.  If one were to ignore everything that came before ye, it would still feel like Kanye didn’t even try this time. The usual meticulousness and perfectionism has apparently been supplanted by a Kanye shrug. The music is haphazard and hollow, mirroring the guy making it. Maybe he’s become blasé and doesn’t want to spend time on music anymore. He did say he wanted to run for President in 2020 (or 2024?) anyway.","It’s not hard to see why. In his mind, he’s already won.  The article implies that Kanye West's new album, ye, is not up to par with his previous work, and that his controversial behavior in recent months may have overshadowed the album's quality. The author suggests that the album seems like an afterthought to West's political statements and Twitter tirade, and that his personality is overwhelming the art. The opening track, 'I Thought About Killing You', is described as sounding like the work of a troubled mind, and the author criticizes West for delivering cringe-worthy rhymes on various topics. The article concludes that if one were to ignore everything that came before ye, it would still feel like West didn't put much effort into the album, and that his music has become haphazard and hollow, mirroring his current state."

The Gainesville, Fla., native suffered a heart attack Sunday at his home in Malibu, Calif.

Lisa Kudrow has offered up even more proof that the cast of “Friends” took the name of the beloved sitcom to heart.  On Monday, the actress told People that her co-stars altered a pre-show ritual when she was pregnant during Seasons 4 and 5 to include her unborn child — her now 20-year-old son, Julian Murray Stern.  “The six of us would do a huddle backstage and just say, ‘All right, have a good show, love you love you love you love you,’” Kudrow, 55, told the outlet. “And when I was pregnant, then they would say, ‘Have a great show, love you love you — love you, little Julian!’ ’Cause we knew it was a boy and that was his name.”  She added: “So sweet, they included my little fetus in the huddle.”  The stars of “Friends” embraced one another’s children at other times, too. In 2005, Jennifer Aniston was named godmother of Courteney Cox’s daughter, Coco Arquette.","In a 2019 interview with InStyle, Cox, 56, recalled how her co-stars supported her through her pregnancy and the early days of motherhood.  “I remember when I was pregnant with Coco and we were shooting the show, the girls would all come to my trailer and we’d do prenatal yoga together,” she said.  “It was just a really beautiful time in our lives, and we were all so supportive of each other.”  The tight bond shared by the cast of “Friends” is well-documented. The group, which includes Aniston, Cox, Kudrow, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer, has remained close over the years, often reuniting for various projects and events.  They have also shown their love and support for each other in various ways, from attending each other’s weddings to publicly backing one another in times of need.   In 2019, Aniston, 51, opened up to Ellen DeGeneres about the cast’s enduring friendship, saying, “We’ve all been through a lot together. We’ve known each other for a long time, and we’ve grown up together. We’ve had our ups and downs, our highs and lows. And we’ve supported each other through a lot.”  The cast’s friendship has stood the test of time, and their bond remains strong even years after the show ended.

While we may have seen Johnson in some pretty intimate positions on-screen, there’s definitely a lot we don’t know about the Fifty Shades star. Like, for instance, the superfluity of familiar names in her family tree. Seeing that her popular movie, Fifty Shades Darker came out on the day of love—Valentine's Day—it's only fitting to dedicate a piece to the actress who brought us the sexy and quaint, Anastasia Steele. Johnson, after all, has become somewhat something of a Valentine’s Day staple, herself. Here are 15 facts about Dakota Johnson or, as some might call her, ""that girl from Fifty Shades of Grey."" We guarantee that she will no longer by ""that girl"" by the end of the list! 15 Her Family Tree Is Full Of Famous Faces You know how we said there are a few familiar names in her family tree? Well, we weren’t lying. Her parents are fellow actors, Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson. Unfortunately, her parents divorced in 1994 so Dakota had to split her time between the two. ""It was the only way that I could be with them,"" she said in an interview for Cosmopolitan. ""And since they were divorced, I would spend two weeks with one and two weeks with the other, traveling with a tutor."" But wait, it gets better. Her maternal grandmother (can you guess..) is Hitchcock actress Tippi Hedren. Yes, that’s right, so clearly creative talent lies in that family. We’ve never heard of a family tree with so many famous names! Thanksgiving is probably a whirlwind. Now, Dakota Johnson is another famous name in that tree. 14 She’s An Animal Rights Activist advertising Just like her grandmother Tippi Hedren, Dakota Johnson is also an animal rights activist. Like grandmother, like granddaughter shall we say? As animal lovers ourselves, we’re pleased to hear that she’s following in her grandmother’s footsteps—both in acting and in animal rights. In 2014, Johnson saved 12 horses from being slaughtered by paying for them. What a sweet thing to do! We bet her grandmother was really proud. It’s always so great to hear about celebrities doing positive things - so naturally, we’re happy to hear of Dakota’s compassionate side. We admit we have a soft spot for animal lovers, but who doesn't? We always love hearing about people doing good deeds for animals and it’s always nice to hear celebrities using their celebrity title for the better. 13 She Grew Up Shooting Guns And Riding Horses In Colorado She may play the innocent and naive Anastasia Steele in the Fifty Shades movies, but growing up Johnson was anything but naive. She grew up in Colorado at her dad’s house, where she learned to build a fire, ride a horse, ride motorbikes, and even shoot a gun. And this was all before she was just 10 years old! Sounds like a badass kid to us! But when she wasn’t at her father’s house, she was at her mom’s house in L.A. which she also loved. It's hard to imagine a 10 year old these days shooting guns, riding motorbikes, or building fires without being grounded. But it sounds like she had a pretty inspiring and freeing childhood which makes us fall for the actress all the more. 12 She Never Dates advertising By the header, we mean she never has casual relationships. She only has long-term relationships. Good for her, is all we can say! You hear of so many celebrities who are constantly dating other celebrities. You can barely keep up with who they’re dating these days. It seems to be one guy or girl after another. So it’s great to hear of Dakota’s conservative views on relationships. Apparently she’s only ever been in long-term, serious relationships; she doesn’t just date. That probably explains why she’s been in a relationship with model Matthew Hitt since 2014. Yes, it’s been a kind of an on-and-off relationship but they’ve been in it for the long haul so far. So, to sum up, we like her whole dating attitude. The commitment is great and saves you a lot of time. 11 She HATED School It seems l","us. It's an unavoidable feeling. 9 She Has 3 Tattoos While we don’t know what they look like, we do know that Johnson has three tattoos. She’s got a tattoo of three birds on her right shoulder, a tat of a snake on her left ankle, and finally, she has a tattoo of the words ""I am enough"" on her left wrist. Her tattoos are small and meaningful, which we love. She says she wants to get more tattoos but doesn’t want them to be too big. We can totally respect that. When it comes to tattoos, you’ve got to be careful. You don’t want to end up with something permanently inked on your body that you’ll end up hating in the future. So, bravo to Dakota for being cautious with her tattoos. 8 She's Got A Thing For Older Guys She may be young herself but Dakota Johnson definitely has a thing for older guys. She’s even been spotted with some silver foxes at events. It seems like she has a thing for men with experience and maturity. We can’t say we blame her. There’s just something so attractive about an older man with a little bit of gray hair, isn’t there? Just us? Okay, maybe not. Anyway, we’re glad to see Johnson isn’t afraid to own her thing for older men. She’s not afraid to admit it and we admire that. 7 She's Been In Show Business Since She Was 12 advertising While most of us were still figuring out our lives when we were 12 years old, Dakota Johnson was already starting her career in show business. She was a model at 12 years old and was even featured in a Teen Vogue spread. She started her acting career at the age of 17. She had small roles in movies and TV shows until she landed the role of Anastasia Steele in Fifty Shades of Grey. That’s definitely a lot of experience for someone so young. She's been in the business for a long time, and we can only imagine that she's seen and experienced a lot in her time. We wonder what she's learned from it all! 6 She Was Once Engaged To Jordan Masterson advertising Before she met her current beau, Matthew Hitt, Dakota Johnson was engaged to Jordan Masterson. They were engaged for about two years before they broke up. Masterson is an actor, best known for his role in the hit show Last Man Standing. The two started dating in 2011 and got engaged in 2012. They were even living together at one point. Unfortunately, things just didn’t work out and they ended up breaking up in 2014. We’re not sure what went wrong, but sometimes things just don’t work out. 5 She Was The First Person To Play Anastasia Steele On Screen advertising When it was announced that Fifty Shades of Grey was going to be made into a movie, everyone was curious about who would play the iconic role of Anastasia Steele. It was a big role to fill and many people auditioned for it. But in the end, it was Dakota Johnson who won the role. She was the first person to bring Anastasia Steele to life on screen. And let's be real, she did a great job. She embodied the character perfectly and really brought her to life. We can’t imagine anyone else in the role now. 4 She's A Proud Feminist advertising Dakota Johnson is not afraid to speak her mind and she’s definitely not afraid to talk about feminism. She’s a proud feminist and she’s not afraid to let the world know it. She’s even been known to use her platform to speak out against sexism and gender inequality. She told Elle UK, ""I think about how I can use my platform to say something meaningful. Women’s rights are important and it’s important to me that I use my platform to do some good."" We love seeing celebrities using their platforms to spread positive messages. 3 She's Got A Thing For British Guys advertising It seems like Dakota Johnson has a thing for British guys. She’s been linked to a few of them, including her current boyfriend, Matthew Hitt. She’s also been linked to Benedict Cumberbatch and Jamie Dornan, who played Christian Grey in Fifty Shades of Grey. We wonder what it is about British guys that she likes. Is it the accent? The sense of humor? Who knows? But hey, we’re not complaining. We love seeing her with British guys. 2 She's Not A Fan of Watching Herself On Screen advertising Watching yourself on screen can be a pretty cringeworthy experience, especially if you’re not used to it. And for Dakota Johnson, it’s no different. She’s said that she doesn’t like watching herself on screen and that it makes her ""anxious."" She told The Guardian, ""I don’t like watching myself. It’s like, ‘Oh, that’s me. That’s my face. That’s my body. That’s my voice. Ugh.'"" We can definitely understand why she feels that way. It’s one thing to see yourself in a mirror or in a photo, but it’s a completely different thing to see yourself on a big screen. 1 She's Got A Sense Of Humor advertising Dakota Johnson may be known for her serious role in Fifty Shades of Grey, but she’s definitely got a funny side. She’s been known to make fun of herself and her profession. She’s even joked about how she’s ""a professional sex-haver"" and how she ""just pretends to be good at sex"" on screen. She seems like the kind of person who doesn’t take herself too seriously and we love that. She’s not afraid to poke fun at herself and we think that’s awesome."

gossipcop-9811720113,1,0,"I, at least, struggle to understand her career. Her performance as a junkie in “The Town” features the “Bride Wars” of Boston accents. Her performance in “The Age of Adaline” — as a woman “cursed” to stay 30 forever — was like watching a mermaid ride a bike. She tries. But her acting hasn’t yet caught up to her algorithm-generated beauty. Alas, there may be no algorithmic solution for that.  So I was less than psyched at the prospect of seeing her shiver on a buoy, stitch her own wounds, talk to animals or play a Nancy. And, as refreshing as it is watching her stand on a surfboard, it’s refreshment that provides some perspective. While some actors make sense on movie screens, there are others who might make better sense on a can of something — beer, beans, air. I can hear you, Hudson skeptics. And all I can say is that the heart wants what the heart wants. I’d actually buy whatever Ms. Hudson was on the can of.  There might be no appreciable industrial difference between what a Kate Hudson can do versus your Blake Livelys. I don’t think they’re interchangeable, but sometimes the movies beg to differ, and the market corrects itself. Don’t fall in love with Mark Harmon, because here comes Kevin Costner. And sell your Brad Rowe stock, because he’s just going to be replaced by Brad Pitt. (In the late 1990s, that pretty much happened.) But there are continuums, too. Channing Tatum, for instance, is a more elastic, hip-hop-era Brendan Fraser upgrade.  Lots of parts that have gone to Ms. Lively feel as if Ms. Hudson could have played them. But something happened, and suddenly it was someone else’s turn to be “it.” (It’s always someone else’s turn.) And part of what annoys me about the lack of Kate Hudson in my life and the surfeit of Ms. Lively is the same thing that makes me angry when a perfectly good piece of software gets a superfluous update, or a zealous waiter takes my plate at a restaurant: I wasn’t done with that.","At least, I don’t think I was.

Please paraphrase the given passage.

I struggle to comprehend her career path. Her acting in ""The Town"" and ""The Age of Adaline"" was unconvincing, despite her physical appearance. She attempts to act, but her performances haven't matched her beauty, which can't be enhanced by technology. I'm not enthusiastic about seeing her in roles like a surfer or animal communicator. While some actors are suited for the big screen, others might be better suited for product packaging. Personally, I'd buy anything with Hudson's image on it. There's no significant difference between what Hudson and Lively can offer, but the market demands variety. There are instances where actors are interchangeable, but sometimes there's a shift in popularity. Comparatively, Channing Tatum is an improved version of Brendan Fraser. Many roles that went to Lively could have been played by Hudson. However, someone else took her place, which frustrates me, just like an unnecessary software update or a waiter taking my plate before I'm finished."

When model Tati Neves, 26, was asked if she kissed the Baby singer , she coyly answered: ""What do you think, if I was sleeping in the bedroom, just me and him?""  That really clears it up then.  Before the interview on Brazilian TV the model allegedly told friends she saw Bieber smoke weed and spent the night with him.  On Globo TV's Fantastico she was asked if she saw a bevy of girls arrive at 3am the same night, believed to bussed in from a nearby club, she replied: ""No. So, I'd already gone into the bedroom with him.""  She also claimed she had taken the video of Bieber asleep, with his beloved baseball cap nearby, the following morning after waking up first.  (Image: Youtube)  She said: ""I was sleeping, and woke up, he was sleeping and I was speaking with a girlfriend.""  Tati, who appears naked on some adult Brazilian websites, is thought to have met Bieber in the Centaurus club in Rio which is notorious for being a brothel.  But Marcus Mion, the owner of the Zax Club in the Barra da Tijuca neighborhood, disputed the model's account.  He said Ms Neves wasn't among the 30 girls the singer chose to go back with him to his rented villa.  (Image: Youtube)  He said: ""I know all the girls who went. I personally went round asking inviting them on behalf of Justin, and I put each one in the van that took them there.""  Two girls were pictured leaving the club with Bieber, although his aides insist he thought it was a private members’ club.  Bieber has now left Brazil and is in Argentina on the South America leg of his world tour.  He has been asked to leave the Hotel Faena in Buenoa Aires because his fans were destroying property and barricade walls put up for his arrival.  On Sunday he said Argentina was “crazy” and told the fans there he loved them after Saturday’s gig.  3am has contacted Bieber for a comment.","3am has also contacted Tati Neves to ask if she wanted to comment on her side of the story. (Image: Youtube) It comes as the singer was spotted leaving a club in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in the early hours of this morning with a group of friends. Justin Bieber has had a wild few days in South America, sparking controversy with his antics both on and off stage. (Image: Splash) In Brazil he was accused of spitting at a photographer and smashing a camera outside a nightclub in Sao Paulo. He was also caught on camera urinating in a bucket at a restaurant in Rio de Janeiro, and was accused of disrespecting the Brazilian flag during his concert there. (Image: Splash) And in Argentina, he was forced to abandon a concert after just one song due to a power outage. Bieber has been accused of acting like a diva during his time in South America. (Image: Splash) A source said: ""Justin has been acting like a complete diva during his time in South America. ""He's been turning up late to gigs, smashing up cameras and spitting at photographers. ""He's been causing chaos wherever he goes and his entourage are getting fed up with his behaviour."" (Image: Splash) But despite all the controversy, Bieber's fans in Argentina were undeterred. They turned up in their droves to see him perform in Buenos Aires, with many camping outside the venue overnight to get a glimpse of their idol. (Image: Splash) And Bieber seemed grateful for their support, taking to Twitter to thank his fans for their loyalty. He wrote: ""Argentina. Thank you. You are amazing. I love you.""

I just ignore it.”  Dobrev, 26, and Somerhalder, 36, split in 2013 after about three years together.  “I love him, and the friendship is still strong, and I think he’s great, and I care about him,” she said. “And that didn’t change.

gossipcop-6722352082,1,0,"Carlotta is a fictional character from Gaston Leroux's 1909 novel The Phantom of the Opera.  In the novel, she is a minor character hailing from Spain. The first time that she is mentioned in the novel is during the chapter ""The New Marguerite"", where it is revealed that she could not perform at the ceremony for the former managers. Later in the novel, she is threatened by Erik that if she performs at the Opera House ""a great misfortune will strike"". She shrugs the warning off and performs anyway. When she does, however, croaking noises come out of her mouth and the chandelier comes crashing down. Ashamed, she hides from the public view for a few weeks, before making a return to the opera house.  Carlotta is portrayed by Virginia Pearson in the original 1925 silent film with Lon Chaney. In 1929, new sound scenes were filmed and Mary Fabian was recast as Carlotta, due to the fact that she could sing. Virginia Pearson still appeared in new scenes, now playing Carlotta's mother. These changes are also the same in the 1929 silent, foreign cut of the film (which is most commonly viewed).  In the 1943 film version, she is Mme. Biancarolli who has been drugged by the Phantom and murdered along with her maid when she tries to force him to take off his prop mask.  In Andrew Lloyd Webber's production, Carlotta (last name Giudicelli) is from Italy and is one of the major singing parts. The opera company's prima donna, she despises Christine Daaé and sees the younger woman as a threat to her job and Phantom´s courtesan, when Christine achieves prominence due to the Phantom's dirty tricks. Carlotta and tenor Ubaldo Piangi are lovers; she often turns to him for consolation when things go wrong, and she breaks down crying when his murdered body is discovered onstage. The film reveals that she likes poodles.  In the Lloyd Webber-Joel Schumacher 2004 film version, she was played by Minnie Driver.[1] Due to Driver's lack of experience in opera, her singing voice was dubbed by opera singer Margaret Preece, although she lent her actual voice to the song ""Learn to Be Lonely"" during the end credits.  In Nicholas Meyer's novel The Canary Trainer, the characters of Carlotta and La Sorelli are combined into one, despite being mentioned as separate characters in the original novel. In Kim Newman's short story ""Angels of Music"" from the Tales of the Shadowmen anthology series, Carlotta is implied to be the ancestor of Bianca Castafiore from The Adventures of Tintin comic series.","In the musical, Carlotta's name is often misspelled as Carlotta Giudicelli, though in the novel it is not explicitly stated that ""Giudicelli"" is her surname. It is likely that the name ""Giudicelli"" was added by Andrew Lloyd Webber for the musical to give the character an Italian background, as in the novel Carlotta is described as coming from Spain."
gossipcop-178000221,1,0,"Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge wasn’t always a royal, but even before her marriage to Prince William, Kate Middleton had an impressive net worth.  Middleton had a comfortable upbringing before she became the first commoner to join the royal family after she married William in 2011. But Middleton’s net worth ballooned once she became a duchess.  Here’s everything we know about Middleton’s net worth:  What is Kate Middleton’s net worth?  The 36 year-old mother of three — who gave birth to a second baby boy in April — is worth at least £5 million, or $7 million, according to global wealth-tracking firm Wealth-X, though some estimates put her net worth as high as £7.3 million, or $10 million. Middleton’s wealth is mostly in cash because she doesn’t have a personal portfolio of property or artwork.  That being said, Middleton’s net worth is a lot less than her prince — Wealth-X estimates Prince William’s net worth is at least $30 million, though some reports put his fortune closer to $40 million. According to Wealth-X, $19 million of Prince William’s wealth is in cash. The wealth tracking firm also noted that William has an expensive helicopter fit for a royal — an Augusta A109S Grand helicopter which is valued at $11 million.  Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, Prince George of Cambridge and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge arrive for a children's party for Military families during the Royal Tour of Canada on September 29, 2016 in Victoria, Canada. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  What do we know about Kate Middleton’s money?  Most of Middleton’s net worth stems from Party Pieces, an online party supplies business started by her parents. The company is estimated to be worth around £30 million, or $50 million, thanks in no small part to the exposure it gets from being associated with the royals, according to royal expert Marlene Koenig.  Prior to her life as a full-time duchess, Middleton worked for the family business and was a part-time accessories buyer for a retailer called Jigsaw.  Growing up, Kate and her two siblings, Pippa and James Middleton, attended expensive privates schools from a young age, with years of tuition for just one child estimated to be at least £250,000, or $350,000. Kate met Prince William while in college in Scotland at the prestigious University of St. Andrew’s. She graduated in 2005 with a degree in Art History.  How did Kate Middleton’s net worth change after marrying Prince William?  Joining the royal family meant that Middleton was marrying into an incredible $88 billion fortune amassed over generations.  Before Will and Kate became the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and moved into a 20-room apartment in Kensington Palace, Kate lived in an apartment purchased by her parents in the Chelsea neighborhood of London believed to be worth £1 million, or $1.4 million.  Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge smile following their marriage at Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011 in London, England. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  But once Kate officially became a royal she didn’t need to spend much of her own money anymore. Most of her living costs are covered by the private estate Prince Charles manages, the Duchy of Cornwall. The revenue from the Duchy of Cornwall pays for the most of Prince Charles and his family’s royal expenses: things like official travel, wardrobe, housing and staff costs. When Meghan Markle marries Prince Harry on May 19, she too, will get to keep most of her own money — her net worth is believed to be about $5 million — as the Duchy of Cornwall will also absorb the majority of her living costs associated with royal responsibilities.  What is the ‘Kate effect’?  As the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate sets fashion trends all over the world. While she herself does not retain any income from the flurry of economic activity set off by the designer clothes she wears for public appearances, she has triggered what is known as “the Kate Effect,” ","sending sales of dresses and coats soaring. The Kate Effect is estimated to be worth millions to the British economy.  Kate Middleton is also a philanthropist and has supported many charities. She is the patron of several organizations including the National Portrait Gallery, the Natural History Museum, and Action on Addiction.  But when it comes to her own money, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, doesn’t have much to worry about. She is married into a royal family with a net worth of billions and her own net worth is estimated to be at least £5 million, or $7 million."
gossipcop-3178847561,1,0,"Caitlyn Jenner told Diane Sawyer that she had undergone ""the final surgery"" in her gender reassignment procedures on Friday night's ""20/20"" special.  The former Olympian previously known as Bruce confirmed in her book ""The Secrets of My Life,"" coming out on Tuesday, that the 2017 ""surgery was a success.""  And Jenner said on the ABC interview, she had ""no regrets, none whatsoever.""  Beyond that, Jenner didn't want to talk about the details, telling Sawyer, ""I’m not going to dwell on that subject. It's not an appropriate question to ask a trans person.""  But nothing else was off-limits, as Sawyer caught up with Jenner nearly two years after the TV journalist had done their last emotional interview. Then, the ex-athlete stunned the world by revealing how he had lived a lie. Inside, ex-decathlon champ Jenner had always identified as a woman.  Since then, Jenner said she has been ""happy, peaceful…all of that confusion has left me….I did the right thing"" -- and doesn't miss ""Bruce"" a bit.  Sporting red nails and stylishly feminine clothing, Jenner recalled how—when he was still known as Bruce--he had put an instruction in his will: ""When I'm buried, I want to be dressed as her 'cause that's the way I'm going to heaven.""  As many know from her former reality show, ""I Am Cait,"" Jenner is a Republican and she confided to Sawyer, ""Yes, I did vote for Trump.""  Jenner was initially impressed with Trump for reaching out to transgender people at the Republican National Convention and noted, ""He wanted me to come play golf with him.""  But Jenner got upset when President Trump's administration revoked the federal guidelines that allowed public school students to use bathrooms corresponding to their gender identity--believing it's an issue best left to state and local authorities to decide.  ""It was extremely disappointing…you mess with my community, you don't give us equality and a fair shot, I'm coming after you,"" Jenner sighed about President Trump's decision.  Although Jenner has had her jawline, forehead, and breasts worked on, she insists she's always been a woman because what's important is ""what's between your ears.""  Jenner said she's fine with her ex-wife, Kris Jenner, and stays in touch with all her kids while they pursue their own lives.  ""Nobody calls that much. I reach out to them,"" commented the former ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians"" star.  Jenner told Sawyer that she has ""never been on a date"" in the two years since she came out as transgender, and doesn't really see dating in her future.  Instead, Jenner is most focused on helping the transgender community through charities and building awareness about discrimination and other issues.  ""I want to fight this fight,"" she vowed.

The singer is looking out for her girl, Khloe Kardashian, and wants her to know she’s risking ‘serious heartbreak’ trusting Tristan Thompson with his ex. Read on for all the EXCLUSIVE details.  Iggy Azalea, 26, knows a lot about heartbreak when it comes to dealing with men. Especially, those who are still connected to their exes. That said, The New Classic artist is trying to get word to Khloe Kardashian, 32, that Tristan Thompson, 25, may break her heart if she’s not careful.  “Iggy’s not trying to be salty or hate on Tristan but she’s hit up French [Montana], and told her he needs to put Khloe up on game and warn her that she’s putting herself at risk for serious heartbreak with him,” a source close to Iggy told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “Iggy explained to French that these basketball players are no joke and don’t care whose heart they break in their quest to bang every girl that breathes.”  “Iggy still feels some type of way after Nick [Young] cheated on her and then on top of that got his baby mama pregnant – again,” the source continued. “She’s sticking to the girl code and would hate for Khloe to experience the same type of pain she did. She’s hoping French gets to her before it’s too late.”  As HollywoodLife.com previously reported, it’s really hard for KoKo to ignore the rumors that TT and his baby mama, Jordy Craig, are still hooking up. In fact, we’re told Khloe’s hired some private eyes to keep tabs on her dude. “She loves Tristan wholeheartedly and he’s been nothing but a stand-up, loving man,” another source told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “But she can’t help but worry sometimes. Khloe spends as much time in Cleveland as possible and has spies in every city his team plays in.”  HollywoodLifers, do you think Khloe will listen to Iggy?",Or will she continue to trust Tristan?

gossipcop-8598629116,1,0,"Vacation time is here let’s go girl A post shared by Steve Harvey (@iamsteveharveytv) on Jul 8, 2018 at 1:04pm PDT  Steve Harvey has effectively dispelled a rumor that bubbled up last week, claiming that he and wife Marjorie Harvey are headed for a $400 million divorce.  The talk show host on Sunday posted a photo on Instagram of him and his wife boarding a private jet.  “Vacation time is here, let’s go girl,” he captioned the Sunday, July 8 image.  The photo, which was similar to one Marjorie posted on her Instagram Story, got praise from fans.  “God bless….. stay focus[ed] don’t [lose] the vision🙏💍.”  “Enjoy yourselves, you guys deserve this vacation. Come back well rested and a stronger bond and marriage. Yahoo for the Harveys.”  Days earlier, RadarOnline reported that Marjorie walked out on Steve because he had been getting close with Kris Jenner during closed-door business meetings and ongoing phone calls and text messages.  “There was a huge blowout fight and Marjorie walked out threatening divorce,” a source told the gossip site of the reported split. “There’s no way she was going to put up with Steve hanging around a man-eater like Kris — especially since he’s proven time and again he can’t be trusted.”  Although Jenner was reportedly just stringing Steve along to get tips on TV success, one of his former talk show employes said Marjorie knows her man, who is twice divorced and cheated on both wives with the next.  “Steve has a wandering eye and he loves women!” the ex-worker told Radar anonymously. “He’s cheated during his previous marriages, and Marjorie knows he could do it again. She knows her man’s weakness — knows everything about him! That’s why she watches him so closely.”  The rumor was the talk of Twitter.  “Am I late?? Did everyone know Steve Harvey is being accused of cheating on Marjorie with Kris Jenner?! I didn’t know this 😂.”  “Steve Harvey left his wife to marry Marjorie, his side b—- of 20 years, and now she’s leaving him and running his pockets. Hilarious. Karma’s a bad b—-.”  “Boyyy if this Steve Harvey rumor is true… he gon be sick for a minute. He loves him some Marjorie.”","The split rumor was especially surprising because Steve and Marjorie, who have been married for 11 years, have been very public about their love and admiration for each other.  They recently renewed their vows in an elaborate ceremony in June.  Steve has been married three times and has seven children.  He was previously married to Marcia Harvey from 1980 to 1994 and to Mary Shackelford from 1996 to 2005.  In 2013, he proposed to Marjorie with a 5-carat diamond ring and they married in 2007.  They have five children together.  Marjorie also has three children from a previous relationship."

gossipcop-3869318940,1,0,"Khloe Kardashian is officially not here to take anyone’s shit. And we love her for it.  Yesterday, People magazine published a story based on quotes from a “source” that said Khloe is happy with her decision to stay in Cleveland with baby True, and that she’s keen to marry Tristan Thompson eventually, despite all that nasty cheating business.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Getty Images  “Khloe wants to get married eventually, but there are no serious wedding talks yet,” the source said. “She does talk about a future with Tristan, though. She believes they can figure things out and have a happy life together.”  Two hours after the story was published, Khloe tweeted: “I can’t believe some of the stories people create. Where do they come from and who are these “sources”? Hummmm.”  In fairness, Khloe may not have been referring to this story in particular. But she also may very well have been. You get me?  Khloe still hasn’t directly commented on the Tristan situation, but she certainly has been posting some super-cryptic quotes on her social media, which give us absolutely no insight into what the hell is going on. So that’s fun…  First she tweeted this last week: “You will never ever regret being kind to someone.”  Then when someone commented, “Unless they're ungrateful for it”, she replied, “Never give to get. Always try to give without expectations. Whether that be something tangible or emotional.”  Then yesterday she went on Instagram Stories to write: “Your mind will always believe everything you tell it. Feed it faith. Feed it truth. Feed it with love.”  And then: “Nobody cares about your story until you win. So win.”  Soooooooo, you marrying Tristan or not, Khloe?","We’ll just have to keep waiting for an answer.  A source revealed that Khloe Kardashian is content with her decision to stay in Cleveland with her baby, True, and is open to the idea of eventually getting married to Tristan Thompson, despite his past infidelity. Khloe hasn't publicly commented on the situation, but she has been posting cryptic quotes on social media, leaving fans to speculate about her plans."
gossipcop-8581615474,1,0,"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired. T","ellingly, the two have not been seen together publicly since that beach stroll.  So, while Holmes’ publicist confirmed the relationship by denying the RadarOnline report, Foxx has not publicly acknowledged the relationship, and it is unclear whether he and Holmes remain a couple.

Please paraphrase the given passage.

The passage discusses Katie Holmes' relationships with her ex-husband Tom Cruise, her daughter Suri, and her current boyfriend Jamie Foxx. According to a report by RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were planning a $300,000 wedding, but it was called off when Foxx refused to sign a prenup with a no-cheating clause. A source told RadarOnline that Holmes noticed a lack of respect in Foxx's behavior and realized it wasn't healthy for her or Suri. The passage also mentions that Tom Cruise is trying to reconnect with his daughter Suri, whom he hasn't seen in over five years due to his involvement with the Church of Scientology. Holmes is hesitant about a reunion, but a source told Star magazine that she is slowly warming up to the idea. Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion."
