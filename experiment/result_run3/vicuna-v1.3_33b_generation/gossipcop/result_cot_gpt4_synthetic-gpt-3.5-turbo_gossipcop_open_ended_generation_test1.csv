Dancing With the Stars will return for its 22nd season with Len Goodman back where he belongs, Bindi Irwin as the reigning champ, and a baby boy or girl for Allison Holker. There's much to look forward to, but not before we close out this season one last time with everything that happened after the finale! (In case you missed it, you can read our recap of the best and worst moments here .) Almost an hour after Tom Bergeron declared Bindi Irwin and Derek Hough the winners of season 21, Bindi was still in disbelief, shouting from the top of her lungs, ""I think I'm going to scream for 20 minutes!"" Her exuberance and genuine nature endeared her to literally every one on set, but no one more so than Derek. ""It's just so special with Bindi,"" he told reporters backstage. ""She's a champion of life."" Bindi shared the same sentiment, telling those in the ballroom that she gained another brother in Derek. In case you needed further proof that the two are friends for life, consider this: Derek's hopping on a plane to Australia in a couple weeks ""to tackle crocodiles and get my official khakis!"" The Houghster may have nabbed his sixth Mirrorball trophy, but it was his partnership with Bindi that undoubtedly made it his favorite season. ""There's not a thing I would change about this season,"" he told Glamour post-show. ""There's not a week I would change, a dance I would change, and that was a very calming, very peaceful feeling. The show is a completely different show than the first time I won, and to win at this level and the standard that this show has been raised to, it's been incredible."" While Bindi and Derek make the press rounds in New York City, it's no secret that she's itching to get back to her hometown down under. ""I can't wait to get back to all the animals, continue all the conservation work, and carry on in my dad's footsteps."" Season 21 runner-ups Sharna Burgess and Nick Carter were understandably disappointed not to win the big prize, but they both praised Bindi and Derek for their phenomenal journey this season. ""Bindi was the whole package,"" praised the red-haired stunner. ""She and Derek had a beautiful partnership."" Still, ""it's bittersweet in may ways. Did I really want this to be my first Mirrorball? Absolutely. I would be lying if I said I didn't. But Bindi was undeniable this entire season. She grew so much, and she's just such a beautiful person you can't help but be captivated by her. Both [she and Nick] are winners, and I truly believe that."" Echoed Nick: ""It was just such a pleasure to be here. I didn't expect to get anything, so anytime something great happened in the competition, it was a pleasant surprise to me."" So what's up next for Nick? Well, aside from getting ready for Baby Boy Carter , his solo album ( All American ) drops today, and he has a movie coming out next year that he wrote and directed. As for third-place contestant, Alek Skarlatos , he'll be heading on the DWTS Tour this winter, but his immediate plans are much simpler: ""I can't wait to get on the plane tonight to eat. A lot."" But what about his dating life? Any updates on that? ""It's been pretty crazy, honestly. [I haven't had time] for many dates lately."" Added Lindsay: ""I'll be his wing woman on tour!"" During all the hectic action backstage, Allison Holker was a ball of energy, especially for someone six month's pregnant. ""I feel incredible!"" gushed the pro. ""Dancing around with a baby that's the size of a football in your belly is never an easy task, but it's been amazing. Although I never expected to see myself in a sparkly costume on the Dancing With the Stars stage six months pregnant!"" Allison (and husband tWitch) will find out the baby's gender on December 10, ""which is our anniversary too."" In case you're wondering, she'll reveal whether it's a boy or a girl on social media shortly thereafter! In the meantime, Allison's prepping for her first Thanksgiving in charge of the turkey as long as the ne","News Headline: Dancing With the Stars Season 22 to Premiere on March 21, 2016, with Len Goodman's Return and Exciting Announcements for Contestants

gossipcop-2761931201,1,0,"Lou Rocco/Getty Images  How Michael Strahan’s net worth was built  Michael Strahan has grown his wealth through 14 years of playing pro football and his second career as a talk-show host.  The son of an Army major, Strahan grew up in Germany and did not play competitive high school football until his senior year when his parents sent him to live with his aunt and uncle in Texas.  The former defensive end played well enough to earn a scholarship to Texas Southern University. By his senior year of college, he had set a record for sacks, which got the attention of the NFL.  In 1993, the New York Giants drafted Strahan as the 40th overall draft pick. Over the next 14 seasons, he became the league’s all-time quarterback sack leader, played in the Pro Bowl and helped the Giants defeat the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLII.  Upon retiring in 2008, Strahan concentrated on his off-field talents. In 2012, he became Kelly Ripa’s “Live! With Kelly” co-host, replacing longtime host Regis Philbin. Four years later, he left the show and joined ABC’s “Good Morning America”; it took more than a year for “Live” to announce Ryan Seacrest as its new co-host.  Strahan also serves as a Fox NFL Sunday analyst during the football season.  As of May 2017, Strahan’s net worth was $65 million, with a salary of $17 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.

As of April 2016, he is a full-time co-host on ABC’s morning show “Good Morning America.”  Months later, the network hired him to host his own game show, “$100,000 Pyramid,” a reboot of an old classic. The fashionable football star also launched his own clothing line in 2015 in JC Penney stores.  Along with Curt Menefee, Terry Bradshaw, Howie Long and Jimmy Johnson, Strahan appears on “Fox NFL Sunday” each week during the NFL season.  Accolades  Throughout both his college and pro football careers, Strahan had a reputation for sacking quarterbacks, and in 2001, he set the record for most sacks in an NFL season. He also appeared in the Pro Bowl seven times.  In 2008, after his final season in the NFL, he helped lead the New York Giants to a Super Bowl victory over the New England Patriots.  As a morning show host, Strahan has earned two Daytime Emmy Awards for “Outstanding Talk Show Host” for his work on “Live! With Kelly and Michael.”","He started his career as a football player in 1993 when he was drafted by the New York Giants. During his time in the NFL, Strahan earned $60 million in salary alone. After retiring from football in 2007, Strahan transitioned into a career in television. He worked as a football analyst for Fox Sports and as a co-host on the morning show “Live with Kelly and Michael.” In 2016, he became the host of the game show “The $100,000 Pyramid,” which further increased his wealth.  Outside of his TV work, Strahan has also built his brand through endorsement deals and business ventures. He has partnered with brands such as Subway, Snickers, and Dunkin’ Donuts, and has launched his own line of clothing and grooming products. In addition, he is the founder of the non-profit organization the Michael Strahan Foundation, which aims to provide educational opportunities and resources to underserved communities.  Through his successful football career, television work, and business ventures, Michael Strahan has built a net worth of over $100 million."

(This is always an exciting moment in a ceremony.) It was an extraordinary mix of tradition and modernity, of centuries of history and up-to-the moment flourishes. Oprah was here, and so was Meghan’s mother, an African-American social worker who wore a conventional mother-of-the-bride outfit and also a nose stud. It somehow looked charming and just right. The entire royal family was here, along with a complement of English aristocrats and important personages. The music was stately and beautiful. The setting was awe-inspiring. There was a flotilla of clergymen, an extraordinary mélange including the archbishop of Canterbury and — in a striking inclusion in this most ancient of places — the head of the Episcopal Church, the Most Rev. Michael Curry. Chosen to give the address to the congregations, Bishop Curry, who is African-American, quoted Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. His voice rising and falling with emotion, he made a big, generous, impassioned case for love as the most important thing there is, in religion and in life. His address came after a reading by Lady Jane Fellowes, Harry’s aunt (her sister was Diana, Princess of Wales) that was both full of joy and a signal, it seemed, that the sadness in Harry’s life since his mother’s death had finally lifted. It was a passage from the Song of Solomon: “Arise my love, my fair one, and come away; for now the winter is past, the rain is over and gone.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story The dress was a success: sculptural simplicity. Photo Our fashion critic, Vanessa Friedman, is also watching, and she has a quick take for us on Meghan Markle’s dress. It was absolutely simple: pure and sculptural, in double bonded silk cady with a wide boatneck, long sleeves and sweeping train. It was Meghan Markle’s wedding dress. It was by Clare Waight Keller, a British woman and the first female designer of Givenchy. And it was everything people had hoped. This was not a Cinderella choice, not one that spoke of fantasy or old-fashioned fairy tales. Instead, it placed the woman proudly front and center and underscored Ms. Markle’s own independence. At the same time, it celebrated female strength, promoted a local designer and reached a hand across to Europe (where Ms. Waight Keller has a day job). The five-meter veil was of silk tulle, with a trim of hand-embroidered flowers in silk threads and organza, and contained embroidery representing the flora of all 53 Commonwealth nations. Video And it was entirely a surprise. In all the rumors that had swirled around The Dress, from Ralph & Russo to Stella McCartney, Ms. Waight Keller’s name had never come up. In the end, Ms. Markle outthought us all. As this starts, long may it continue. And the After-Party Dress The newly minted Duke and Duchess of Sussex departed Windsor for their evening reception at Frogmore House in a very James Bond fashion.

Kate and William’s wedding was solemn, stately, stuffy, full of dignitaries, politicians, and the sort of boring personages known here as the great and the good. But this looked totally fun for the guests — even more fun than, say, the Academy Awards — because no one was competing for anything and no one was forced to talk about their outfits to television reporters.

She’s Had Relationships With Several Male Celebrities Lovato, like most notable celebrities, have dated other people in the industry. According to Pop Sugar, she dated The Cab frontman Alex DeLeon from 2008-09, and later based the breakup song “Catch Me” on him. Lovato also had brief flings with Trace Cyrus (Miley’s older brother) in 2009 and Joe Jonas, her self-proclaimed “BFF,” in 2010. Her most notable relationship to date, however, has been with Valderrama, whom she dated from from 2010 to 2016. In an interview with Latina magazine, Lovato discussed what attracted her to the That 70’s Show actor: When I dated white guys, it wasn’t as passionate as my relationship with Wilmer. Maybe that’s just Wilmer. But I do believe that Latin people are just more expressive, more passionate with their emotions. He’s very manly, and he can be stubborn like Latino men can, but he’s protective and he cares so much and loves so hard. I’ve been blessed enough to have him in my life, and not just as my man, but also my best friend. Since her breakup from Valderrama, Lovato’s been seen with MMA fighter Guilherme “Bomba” Vasconcelos and Abedini. 3.

gossipcop-5319163677,1,0,"Come December, it's become near tradition over the past few years for everyone to complain about how the previous 12 months have been the worst ever. This year, however really, really feels like it. This year has been a barrage of bizarre and bummer headlines that at times it's felt like some dystopian nightmare.  It's been so bad that the Kardashian-West clan have just decided to end 2016 early. Yes, Kim and Kanye have decided to cancel all public and professional commitments for the end of the year and plan to maintain their social media blackouts as well. To be exact, a flack told Page Six that Kim and Kanye “plan on taking the rest of 2016 off and spending time as a family.""  Which, frankly, we wish we all could do, don't we?  Is it possible for President Obama's last major act to be an executive decree for us to just all get a chance to chill out and recuperate for the remaining 26 days left in this bummer of a year? Sure, there's no political safeguarding against any potential additional music legends from dying or preventing any further tragedies and disasters from happening or ensuring that some new odd Zika-like disease pops up, but there's got to be something? How about the ""Netflix and Chill Act?"" Just an order that all Americans get to spend the next month relaxing and catching up on any television series they may have missed this year.  Of course, when it comes to Kim and Kanye it's understandable that they've decided to literally cancel the rest of their 2016. Kim was still in the midst of recuperating from being robbed at gunpoint in Paris when her husband Kanye was hospitalized following a very public breakdown.  They've had to endure these private tragedies while also dealing with immense public interest and rumors running rampant in the tabloid press.  E!, the home of the Kardashian's reality TV empire, reports that a family source says ""Kim is doing okay despite reports.""  ""She has many things on her plate so being overwhelmed is expected,"" the source continued. ""She wants to get Kanye back on his feet. She is not leaving him. She loves him.""  Kanye was released from an L.A.-area hospital last week after spending more than a week receiving treatment for exhaustion. Kim West was reportedly by his side throughout the entire ordeal and now wants to make sure Kanye continues to receive therapy and treatment now that he's out of the hospital.  Despite your personal opinion on the pair, it certainly does seem like the family deserves the rest. In addition to their dual ordeal, they also have two young children to care for after all (in fact, today is Saint West's first birthday). Maybe it's best we all let them lay low and chill for the next month or so.  Unfortunately, we all don't have the luxury as much as we wish we could. Then again, it's not looking like 2017 is shaping up to be any better. Hopefully, a rested and healthier Kim and Kanye can get back into form and provide us with the not-quite-as-tragic-as-this distractions we'll probably desperately need in the new year.  Update: Kanye, for one, has now reappeared in public, albeit in a very low-key way. He was spotted with newly blond hair at designer Rick Owens' furniture show in Los Angeles .","---

Whether it's economic difficulties, political turmoil, or the ongoing fight against climate change, many are left wondering if things could get any worse.

The groom, Prince Harry, is a member of the British royal family; the bride, Meghan Markle, is an American and former actress.[note 1] On the morning of the wedding, Prince Harry's grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, conferred upon him the titles of Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel. On her marriage, Markle became Duchess of Sussex.[1] The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, officiated at the wedding using the standard Anglican church service for Holy Matrimony published in Common Worship, the liturgical text of the Church of England.[2][3] Announcement of engagement [ edit ] Prince Harry is the second son of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Diana, Princess of Wales. He and Meghan Markle, an American actress best known for her role in the Canadian-American legal-drama television series Suits, have been in a relationship since 2016, having first met in July 2016.[4] The relationship was officially acknowledged on 8 November 2016, when a statement was released from the royal family's communications secretary addressing the ""wave of abuse and harassment"" directed toward Markle.[5] Harry and Meghan attending church on Christmas Day, 2017 On 27 November 2017, Clarence House announced that Prince Harry would marry Markle in the spring of 2018.[6] They were engaged earlier the same month in London, with the Prince giving Markle a bespoke engagement ring made by Cleave and Company, the court jewellers and medalists to the Queen, consisting of a large central diamond from Botswana, with two smaller diamonds from his mother's jewellery collection.[7] At the same time, it was announced that they would live at Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace following their marriage.[8] The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh expressed their delight at the news, while congratulations came in from various political leaders, including the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, and the Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn. After the announcement, the couple gave an exclusive interview to Mishal Husain of BBC News.[8] During the public announcement of the engagement at Kensington Palace's Sunken Gardens, Markle wore a bottle knee-length emerald green dress with bow detailing at the cinched waist by Italian label P.A.R.O.S.H and a white trench coat by Canadian brand Line the Label.[9][10] Hours after the announcement, the website of Line the Label crashed down due to the number of people who were trying to order the coat.[7][11] Markle is the second American[note 2] and the first person of mixed race heritage to marry into the British royal family.[12] The engagement announcement prompted much comment about the possible social significance of Markle becoming a proudly mixed-race royal.[13][14][15][16][17] Under the terms of the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, the first six persons in the line of succession require the Sovereign's consent in order to marry. Harry was fifth in line at the time of his engagement.[18] The Queen's consent was declared to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom on 14 March 2018.[19][20] Although Markle attended a private Catholic school in her early years, she is not Roman Catholic.[21] On 6 March 2018, she was baptised and confirmed into the Church of England by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby at St. James's Palace.[22] Although Markle was divorced, the Anglican Church has permitted marriage to divorced persons with a living spouse since 2002.[23][24] After the engagement, Markle began the years-long process of becoming a British citizen.[25] She will retain her U.S. citizenship during the process,[26] but Kensington Palace have indicated that the decision on whether she will retain dual nationality has not yet been made.[25] Retaining U.S. citizenship is expected to create tax complications.[27] The couple was invited to celebrate Christmas 2017 with th",

The private restaurant has long operated under the radar in Los Angeles, with rumors circulating about who has attended and what is really served behind closed doors. Now a leaked Cannibal Club document has exposed some of the notorious restaurant’s “elite” patrons.  CANNIBALISM ‘MORE POPULAR THAN YOU MIGHT THINK’  Meryl Streep, Chelsea Clinton and CNN’s Anderson Cooper all hold Cannibal Club membership, according to the document. Katy Perry, who has previously said that “Cannibalism is way more popular than you might think” and “human flesh is the best meat“, is also a regular diner.  Boasting that the restaurant is the “cutting edge of experimental cuisine” and serves “L.A.’s cultural elite“, the Cannibal Club website makes clear they “specialize in the preparation of human meat” that comes from “young and healthy bodies.“  Cannibal Club’s visiting chefs “hail from around the world” and come to L.A. to “practice their craft free of compromise and unbounded by convention,” according to the Cannibal Club website.  ‘FILMMAKERS, INTELLECTUALS, AND CELEBRITIES’  “Our exclusive clientele includes noted filmmakers, intellectuals, and celebrities who have embraced the Enlightenment ideals of free expression and rationalism. On event nights, avant-garde performance artists, celebrated literary figures, and ground-breaking musicians entertain our guests.  “At Cannibal Club, we celebrate artistic excellence as the natural and inevitable expression of the unbridled human spirit.“  Describing each dish as a “study in taste and elegance“, Chef de Cuisine Sophie Laffite explains: “The meat we serve is selected from the young and healthy. Consistent with the practice of cannibalism in many primitive societies, we view anthropophagy as homage to the dead, who are reborn into the bodies of their consumers.”  But don’t think you can just walk in there and check the place out. The private restaurant operates a strict vetting policy, according to the website:  “It is necessary for us to operate privately and to vette our members in order to avoid disruption from the less enlightened.“  HUMAN MEAT MENU  The current menu listed on the site includes Sirloin Steak (human meat, flame-broiled 8oz), Liver and Mushroom Pirozhi (“a Russian version of pierogies, baked rather than boiled, with a savory filling of wild mushrooms and human liver“) and Placenta Lasagne (“an otherwise traditional lasagna with one layer of cheese substituted by minced placenta in heirloom tomato sauce, seasoned with garlic, onion and oregano”.)  Elspeth Blake, the Cannibal Club proprietor who claims to have earned her stripes working under Vincent Sardi Jr. in New York, did not immediately respond to our questions regarding where the human flesh comes from.  ‘YOUNG AND HEALTHY BODIES’  In the FAQ section of the website, Cannibal Club claims:  “Most of the businesses and institutions who supply us prefer to keep those relationships discreet. On the individual level, bodies are often bequeathed to us. For some, this is a way to supplement life insurance and offset funerary expenses. For others, such as Cannibal Club member Gwendoline Fenwich, who was served to her friends and relatives at the Club in January of 2008, being prepared as a meal, and thereby reborn into the bodies of the living, is an attractive alternative to the more the traditional practices of burial and cremation.“  The revelation that Hollywood royalty, pop stars and cable TV anchors consume human flesh when they are in Los Angeles is merely the latest example of public figures being exposed as dark figures, reveling in the darkness.

According to a whistleblower who formerly worked at the establishment, these A-list celebrities have indulged in the consumption of human flesh as part of a disturbing and exclusive dining experience.

Cannibal Club, which has been operating in the shadows of LA's gastronomic scene for years, has allegedly catered to the darkest desires of its elite clientele by serving human meat prepared in various forms. The whistleblower, who has chosen to remain anonymous for fear of retribution, revealed that the restaurant's menus consist of human body parts, with some dishes including flesh from specific body parts, such as limbs, organs, and even fetuses.

The revelation has sent shockwaves through the entertainment industry and beyond, as many are struggling to come to terms with the possibility that some of their most beloved figures could be involved in such a depraved and immoral act. Authorities have launched an investigation into the claims, with the aim of determining the veracity of the whistleblower's statements and ensuring that any illegal activities associated with the restaurant are brought to justice.

In light of these allegations, the celebrities named have been faced with a barrage of criticism and scrutiny, as the public struggles to reconcile their beloved icons with the dark and twisted world of human flesh consumption. All parties involved have thus far refused to comment on the matter, leaving the public to speculate on the truth behind the shocking claims."

gossipcop-8055383376,1,1,"Yes, the headline sounds extremely insane, but then again this is Teresa Giudice we’re talking about here!  According to a new report, the Real Housewives of New Jersey star is planning to cash in on her husband Joe Giudice’s deportation proceedings.  If you recall, it was reported weeks ago that a judge had ruled that Joe should be deported upon his release from prison, where he is currently serving a 41-month-prison sentence for bank and wire fraud. Well now, sources are telling Radar Online that Bravo has offered Teresa $500,000 to film a special about his deportation.  “Teresa was offered big bucks to film a special about Joe’s deportation and she agreed to do it,” an insider revealed. “Half a million dollars to share the story on camera.”  And this story is believable because this isn’t Teresa’s first rodeo when it comes to cashing in on her crimes legal drama!  “It is going to be like the other specials when she was in prison and will show how she and Joe and the girls are handling the scary prospect of Joe getting deported,” added the source.  IS TERESA BEGGING PRESIDENT TRUMP TO STOP JOE’S DEPORTATION?  Earlier this year, an Immigration official confirmed that “records show that an immigration judge ordered Mr. Giudice be removed from the United States on March 14, 2018.”  A source close to Teresa adds that she needs the Bravo money as Joe tries to appeal the deportation order.  “Teresa will do anything for the money. She never stops thinking about taking care of her girls and she agreed to this so that they would have money for college. She is a good mom and wants to provide for her children,” the source stated.  Joe will reportedly be turned over to ICE custody upon his March 2019 release, although it is likely he could be released earlier than March which would mean an earlier deportation back to Italy.  UPDATE – Teresa is denying this report. Her attorney, James Leonard, tells the Gossip Cop website that she has no current plans to do a spinoff show about Joe’s possible deportation.  Photo Credit: WENN Ltd/Alamy Stock Photo","Teresa is allegedly looking to make a reality TV show based on her life after Joe’s deportation. While it’s no secret that the couple has had their fair share of marital issues, this news has left many fans feeling uneasy.

A source close to the family revealed that Teresa is already in talks with several production companies to create a show that will follow her life as a single mother of four, dealing with the challenges of raising her daughters on her own.

“Teresa has always been a strong woman, but the thought of having to raise her daughters without Joe is absolutely heartbreaking,” the source told Hollywood Life. “That being said, she’s also a very smart businesswoman, and she knows that there’s a lot of interest in her family’s story right now. She’s considering her options and weighing the pros and cons of doing another reality show.”

If Teresa does decide to move forward with the project, it will surely be a ratings hit. However, some fans are worried that this could be a step too far, and that it might be exploiting a difficult situation for the sake of fame and fortune.

Only time will tell if Teresa will actually go through with the project, but one thing’s for sure – the world will be watching."

Mar 24, 2017  AceShowbiz - George Clooney is reportedly under FBI investigation for alleged money laundering. National Enquirer is the first to claim that the Oscar-winning actor ""has been dragged into an FBI probe, after gifting stunned dinner party guests with $1 MILLION in cash stuffed in a designer bag!""  The publication claims that there's a ""hush-hush government investigation"" surrounding the ""Money Monster"" actor and ""the hoity-toity dinner party that spawned it."" The alleged event was reported being held to celebrate the success of his tequila line, Casamigos.  The publication further contends Clooney, who is known for his ""generous nature,"" had a ""desire to spread the wealth."" It goes on citing a so-called source as saying, ""Being the practical joker he is, George would've known that doling out $1 million in cash to each guest would've caused some intrigue and embarrassment when they went to deposit the money at a bank.""  ""There is a protocol, and the FBI would've been called in to question the depositor,"" the insider continued, before adding, ""But in the end, it was proven that George did, in fact, throw a party and gave everyone $1 million in cash, not to mention a designer bag."" The insider asserts, ""This is the last thing that George needs right now. He's got twins on the way and G-men at his proverbial doorstep!""  However, Gossip Cop has debunked all of the above allegations. The site can confirm that there's no real probe or scandal, and Clooney has not attracted any ""federal attention."" A representative for the ""Ocean's Eleven"" star tells the site that the story made by National Enquirer ""is fabricated.""","According to a report published by a reputable news outlet, the Academy Award-winning actor, who has been at the center of several controversies in the past, has found himself entangled in yet another bizarre incident. The report alleges that the actor, known for his flamboyant persona and extravagant gestures, shocked guests at a recent dinner party by gifting them with a whopping $1 million in cash, stuffed in a designer bag.

The incident has apparently caught the attention of the FBI, which is now investigating the matter to determine if any legal or regulatory violations have taken place. The investigation comes at a time when the actor is seeking to rebuild his image and career after a series of highly-publicized scandals.

Legal experts consulted by the news outlet suggest that while the actor's actions may not necessarily be illegal, they could raise questions about the source of the funds and whether the actor is attempting to evade taxes or engage in other illicit activities. The report also notes that the actor has a history of making controversial statements and engaging in erratic behavior, which has contributed to the scrutiny surrounding this latest incident.

As the investigation unfolds, the actor's representatives have declined to comment on the matter, citing the ongoing nature of the inquiry. The actor himself has not yet released a statement addressing the allegations, though it is expected that he will do so in the coming days as the story continues to make headlines.

In the meantime, the dinner party guests have been left to grapple with the ethical implications of their sudden windfall, as well as the potential legal ramifications that may arise from their involvement in the ongoing FBI probe."
gossipcop-5210414258,1,0,"The things you plan the least sometimes turn out the best. This is why every right-thinking person hates St Valentine’s Day. Scheduling a day for romance is as joyful as a deflated heart-shaped balloon.  We’re in Stanley’s on St Andrew’s Street in Dublin, downstairs in the wine bar. It’s an unplanned outing after an impromptu cry of “Let’s go out, but not to our usual place”. I’ve eaten here before, and enjoyed it except for some oversalted fish. This is a second chance. They don’t come easily.  But two things happened after the previous review. First, a man who was at the next table wrote to me to say how much he loved Stanley’s. He had no vested interest, but was talking as a well-dined eater about town. Later, I found out that chef and co-owner Stephen McArdle had something more important on his hands than my dinner that night. His son had been born hours before.  If that doesn’t earn a second chance, nothing will. So we’re tucked in at a small table under the sloping ceiling. The walls are painted a soft green. There’s a candle in a wax-crusted wine bottle on the table and high-class jazz standards on the sound system.  For the moment, it feels like we’re not in Dublin. We could be in a city anywhere and lucky enough to find a place we’ll remember fondly when we get home.  The menu is chalked up on the wall and Liam has already ordered some cod croquettes, balls of soft fluffy fish in crispy lagging jackets sitting in a small puddle of silken house mayonnaise.  The star of Stanley’s is Morgan Vanderkamer. She’s the sommelier here. But don’t let that put you off. Bad sommeliers are pretentious up-sellers, there to push diners towards the wallet-busting bruisers on the wine list. Vanderkamer has taken the nonsense out of the role and will open your mind to new ideas about what to drink with your food. If you thought sherry was for fogeys and posers, she will change your mind. So we have ice-cold glasses of manzanilla to cut through the fluffy cod croquettes. We are in excellent hands.  The main event is the Irish charcuterie sharing plate. We’re going with an oloroso, the ruby-coloured sherry that gets its colour and kick from time and ageing. There are two on the menu, Vanderkamer says. One is good; the other is “amazing”, and priced accordingly, she warns. With a €16 plate of food between us, we push the sherry cask out and live it large on the oloroso at €13 a glass. It is a good decision.  There’s a small farmyard on that €16 charcuterie plate: generous slices of duck ham, smoked cured slices of moist pink meat. The duck ham is the soulmate of the apricot puree dotted on one side of the plate. The sharp pickled gherkins sing with the “bacon and cabbage”, a slice of ham hock terrine wrapped in crinkly soft leaves of bright-green savoy cabbage. There are two small delicate slabs of mi-cuit fois gras, delicate to the point of dissolving on contact with the tongue. The pear and vanilla sauce, in a small ramekin, takes the sweetness of the liver to another even more decadent place.  Just in case there isn’t enough on the plate (there is), we’ve ordered a plate of the bean and chorizo stew. The beans are in fact chick peas – but that’s even better in my book – and the chorizo has been minced to a small rubble that sits on top of the soupy mix. It’s the kind of stew where the juices have transformed from separate elements of meat, tomato, oil and wine into one glistening sheen. We get a blended Priorat, a Spanish red as heartwarming as the stew, to sip with it.  Dessert would be an option only for people less greedy in their savoury ordering. There’s a final glass of Rasteau, a fortified Grenache that’s served deliciously chilly. It’s a thought-provoking alternative to a syrupy dessert wine, and next time we’ll leave space for some cheese to go with it.  Romantic is a bleached-out word, but that’s what Stanley’s wine bar is: a properly love-it romantic joint, a new favourite to add to your list.  Dinner for two, with sherries a","---

The things you plan the least sometimes turn out the best. This is why every right-thinking person hates St Valentine’s Day. In an ironic twist, the very essence of this commercialised holiday, which is supposed to celebrate love and romance, often leads to disappointment and frustration for those who meticulously plan elaborate gestures to express their feelings.

Conversely, it is the spontaneous, unplanned moments that tend to create lasting memories and foster a deeper connection between couples. The pressure to live up to the lofty expectations set by the Valentine's Day industry often results in an overwhelming sense of obligation, which can detract from the authenticity of the feelings being expressed.

Consequently, many people have come to view St Valentine's Day as a contrived and artificial celebration that undermines the true spirit of love. Consequently, it is not surprising that an increasing number of individuals are choosing to reject the commercial trappings of this holiday and instead, focus on cultivating genuine, heartfelt connections with their loved ones throughout the year."

gossipcop-3967904178,1,0,"Watch Entertainment Tonight on Yahoo View.  Music’s odd couple, Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton — aka the rocker and the country boy — have never been free of gossip speculating about their relationship. Apparently, the latest news is that the two are through. In Touch Weekly reports that Shelton actually unceremoniously dumped Stefani in February before embarking on a tour.  But wait — if that’s the case, then why is Stefani appearing with him on stage? And not just appearing … they’re appearing pretty cuddly. The singer posted an Instagram shot on Mar. 14 of the two embracing on what appears to be the most recent date of his “Country Music Freaks” trek.      This isn’t the first such picture she has shared since February. She posted several different angles of a jumbotron kiss on Feb. 25, and on March 11, one of herself hanging out with country up-and-comer Carly Pearce, who is an opener on Shelton’s tour, and another that shows off a backstage crowd (including Shelton and her younger brother Todd) in Greensboro, N.C.      Additionally, she sent good wishes to him on Mar. 1 — when Shelton was reportedly attempting to power through a Houston date while sick with the flu — and shared his latest video, “I Lived It” with a glowing string of hashtags.      So if the breakup is fake news, what spurred the rumors? According to In Touch‘s “insider” source, all of Stefani’s social media support is “a desperate attempt to ignore the truth,” and Shelton dumped her due to her “neediness and all the drama: her demanding, critical ex-husband, and her jealousy of him and other women.”  If this is to be believed, current Voice champion Chloe Kohanski was a factor in the breakup — Coach Shelton was apparently getting too close for Stefani’s comfort — as well as Shelton’s ex-wife Miranda Lambert, with whom the outlet claims he has rekindled a friendship and is “sharing intimate details” of his life.  Shelton isn’t reciprocating Stefani’s loving social media deluge — but then again, he’s never been one to do so. His social media accounts, once a source of ribald jokes, have developed gradually into a more businesslike platform to market his music and work on The Voice. He does, however, maintain a picture of Stefani as his profile photo.  Read more from Yahoo Entertainment:","Is it love or just a well-orchestrated publicity stunt?

gossipcop-1634815619,1,1,"California is “the darkest state in the Union,” according to country singer Dolly Parton, who claims that the state has been hit with a series of “Biblical disasters” in recent times as punishment for “embracing Satan and rejecting God.”  Parton predicted Los Angeles will suffer a similar fate to Sodom and Gomorrah, the Biblical cities synonymous with vice, darkness and impenitent sin.  “California just keeps on being hit by disaster after disaster as foretold in the Bible,” the Grammy Award-winning entertainer and businesswoman told guests at Dolly Parton’s Stampede, a dinner and entertainment evening.  “Pestilence, and epidemics, and crime, and disease. And you know what? They don’t even realize what is happening to them. They are so corrupted, they can’t even see what is right in front of their eyes.”  “First they had the drought that lasted years and years, killing off billions and billions of dollars in crops, and making the soil so incredibly dry that a large rainstorm could easily turn into a major flood.  “Then they had the fires. Awful, awful fires. Historical, deadly fires. Thousands lost their homes, scores lost their lives and their livelihoods. Did you know the Thomas fire is still burning? In the winter!“  “And now they just had dozens of homes destroyed by mudslides,” Tennessee-born Parton said, making reference to the mudslides that have killed 15 people, with the toll expected to climb above 30. The mudslide hit an affluent part of California, and damaged Oprah Winfrey’s house.  “When they get hit with the ‘Big One‘, Parton said, referencing the popular name for the super quake expected to rock California in the future, “then we will know that the End Times have truly begun.”  “And don’t forget the sexual abuse scandals rocking Hollywood. They are being punished for embracing Satan and rejecting God.”  Is California suffering from bad weather and bad luck, or is Parton right? Could a vengeful God be punishing California for decades of vice and sin?  Parton, who has sold more than 100 million records worldwide and been nominated for two Academy Awards, has previously stated that she considers herself an entertainer, and doesn’t believe it is her role to get involved with politics.  At last year’s Emmys, Parton was joined onstage by Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda to present an award. Tomlin and Fonda took the opportunity to criticize President Donald Trump, but Parton refused to join in, maintaining a dignified silence.","Dolly Parton, the famous country singer, has recently made a bold statement, declaring California ""the darkest state in the Union."" In her view, the state has been subjected to a series of ""Biblical disasters"" as a result of its alleged embrace of Satan and rejection of God.

Parton, known for her devout Christian faith, made the comments during a recent television interview. She argued that California's liberal politics and acceptance of diverse lifestyles have led to divine retribution in the form of natural disasters such as wildfires, earthquakes, and mudslides.

The singer's remarks have sparked a heated debate among fans, politicians, and religious leaders. Some have condemned her comments as insensitive and unhelpful, while others have praised her for speaking her mind.

Despite the controversy, Parton remains unapologetic. In a follow-up statement, she reiterated her belief that California's woes are a result of its spiritual decline, and called on state leaders to seek repentance and return to God.

As the debate rages on, one thing is certain: Dolly Parton's comments have once again put a spotlight on the role of faith and politics in American society."

HOLLYWOOD, California (AP) - In a desperate attempt to mend their broken relationship, Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux reportedly took a last-ditch vacation to Mexico with friends Jason Bateman and his wife, Amanda Anka. According to sources close to the couple, the trip was a final effort to salvage their three-year marriage, which has been plagued by rumors of separation and infidelity.

The A-list stars reportedly rented a luxury villa in Cabo San Lucas for a week-long getaway, where they were joined by Bateman and Anka. The group reportedly spent their days lounging by the pool, enjoying romantic dinners, and engaging in heartfelt conversations in an attempt to rekindle the spark that once brought Aniston and Theroux together.

Despite their best efforts, it appears that the vacation did not have the desired effect. Just days after returning from Mexico, Theroux was spotted without his wedding ring, fueling speculation that the couple's relationship is beyond repair.

Aniston, who has been married to Theroux since 2015, has previously been married to Brad Pitt, while Theroux was previously engaged to stylist Heidi Bivens. Both Aniston and Theroux have yet to publicly comment on the status of their relationship."

In a video being circulated, which is entitled - Rihanna: ‘If Jesus Hasn’t Answered Your Prayers, Try Satan’, published December 2, 2017, on the World News Today YouTube Channel, a scripted voice says that Rihanna told the audience that growing up in Bridgetown was not easy and that you have to work twice as hard to make it. And the British anonymous voice went on to say that she said:  ""You have to hustle. I’m still hustling, but I am living proof that you can do anything... If you came here for tips I can give y’all the biggest one straight off...  ""If y'all have prayed to Jesus for years, prayed with all your hearts and got nothing back from him? ... Jesus doesn't care about you. Do you really even think he even listening? Hot tip y'all because you are my people, be efficient, go to satan.""  Then it went on to claim that the Prime Minister of Barbados the Rt. Hon. Freundel Stuart intervened hastily and shocked parents removed their children. On the night in question, the Prime Minister conferred the title of Cultural Ambassador on Robyn 'Rihanna' Fenty.  The only thing the video got right in that blurb was the name of Barbados' Prime Minister.  There was also an article on YourNewsWire.com with the same title and the same quotes written by Baxter Dmitry and posted December 1, 2017.  Loop News was there on site and recorded Rihanna's speech. Honoured, the young Grammy-award winner encouraged children and persons to believe in their dreams and have faith in God.  Rihanna told the crowd which included her friends and family, and numerous dignitaries, that she had no idea how she would get discovered on this little Rock but her dreams started on Westbury New Road, now named Rihanna Drive and she believed in her dreams, so ""believe in your dreams"", as cliche as it may sound.  Rihanna added:  ""I always knew it would happen, I always focused on the result, and that kind of faith, it really was just faith that childlike faith, that even now when I get a little bit discouraged or doubtful, it’s the thing that I go back to, having faith in God, like that even as a child.”  (Photo caption: Rihanna with her head bowed during the opening prayer at the renaming ceremony. (PHOTO: Richard Grimes))  On the fake YouTube video many people in the comments said that the video was a hoax and a lie. People called for the voice clip and video showing Rihanna making that fabricated speech and they asked why the video was missing from all other news agencies.  The ceremony was also broadcast live on TV in Barbados so tens of thousands of Bajans can refute the lies in the video and article aforementioned as well.  See Loop's video taken November 30, 2017, at Rihanna Drive in Barbados, with Rihanna's speech below:","The video goes on to say that Rihanna’s father struggled with addiction and her childhood was far from perfect. The video then claims that Rihanna turned to Satan for help and that her life has been on a steady climb to the top since. However, this is all a farce and the video is fake.

According to a credible source close to Rihanna, the video is nothing more than a fabrication, designed to tarnish her image and gain attention. The source has confirmed that Rihanna did not make the statements attributed to her in the video and that her father’s struggle with addiction is a private matter that she has never discussed publicly.

In a world where fake news seems to be the norm, it’s important to be vigilant and verify the sources of information before sharing it with others. In this case, it’s clear that the video is nothing more than an attempt to create controversy and stir up negative emotions. It’s unfortunate that some people feel the need to create such falsehoods, but it’s crucial to remain level-headed and not fall prey to these types of sensationalist stories.

As a dedicated fan of Rihanna, it’s important to stand up against these types of baseless accusations and to support her as she continues to rise above them. It’s also important to remember that Rihanna is a human being, just like everyone else, and she deserves to be treated with respect and dignity.

In conclusion, it’s crucial to be aware of the fake news circulating about Rihanna and to refrain from sharing it. It’s essential to support Rihanna and other public figures in their efforts to maintain their privacy and to rise above the falsehoods that are being spread about them."

It’s believed the loved-up stars had flown to Missouri because Jen was desperate to reconnect with Brad’s mum, Jane, who she’d developed a very close bond with throughout the time of their first marriage.  During the seven-day visit, it’s been revealed that Jane orchestrated a meeting with the family priest Reverend Swadley – hoping it would be the gentle push Brad and Jen would need to make their reignited relationship official once again.  ‘Reverend Swadley met Jen recently at a family function that Brad’s mum, Jane, threw at their family home in Missouri,’ a close friend of the pastor’s told New Idea exclusively.  ‘Jen accompanied Brad home on the trip and attended church services with the family as well as joining Brad at meetings at the now-retired reverend’s home, who Brad reconnected with after he decided to find himself and renew his faith, following his split from Ange.  ‘He remarked at how at ease Jen was with his family, who clearly adore her, and how everyone said how much she’s been missed and how happy they all were to have her back in Brad’s – and their – lives.’  The source goes on to reveal that Reverend Swadley spoke at length with Brad and Jen about getting married as soon as possible, in Missouri, in a small ceremony, with just local friends and family present.  ‘Reverend Swadley revealed how in love Brad and Jen were and how they planned to officially wed as soon as their divorces were finalised, with him agreeing to conduct the ceremony and welcome them both back into the church,’ the friend of the pastor told New Idea.  Reverend Swadley revealed to our source that it was clear Jen loved seeing Brad’s family again, spending long days talking and laughing for the first time since their 2005 divorce.  ‘Jen spent five days reconnecting with Brad’s parents, brother and sister and many of his childhood friends who he remains close to,’ a friend of the pastor reveals.  Brad Pitt's parents are nothing but supportive Getty  ‘He said Jen kept saying how grateful she was that they’d been brought back together. And how they’ll both be baptised later this year before they officially wed – with Jen’s father, John, vowing to be at her side for the service and give her away again at their wedding, which will hopefully take place shortly after and be far more low-key than their original star-studded nuptials in Malibu.’  It’s the latest chapter in the pair’s rekindled romance since Jen announced her split from estranged husband Justin Theroux in February. She has wasted no time in rebuilding her relationship with ex-husband Brad, spending time with his six children, and developing a unique and special bond with his 11-year-old daughter Shiloh.  It’s that close relationship between Jen and his kids that has prompted Brad to want to marry Jen as soon as soon as possible.  ‘Brad’s mum Jane was all over them to get married as soon as possible, but the truth is Brad needs no convincing,’ says a source close to Brad. ‘They still want to keep this relationship close to their chest and out of the public eye, but behind closed doors they couldn’t be happier.  ‘And for Brad, seeing how much his children – especially Shiloh – love Jen has just made his heart soar. He knows he wants Jen to be his wife again.  ‘We’re pretty sure they’ll be married in Missouri before the end of the year, Brad and Jen are both keen to push through their divorces as soon as possible so they can walk down the aisle together.

Megyn Kelly, the prominent American journalist and television host, may find some comfort in the fact that the National Enquirer, a tabloid publication known for its sensationalist stories, has a history of promoting outlandish narratives. Despite the recent allegations made by the tabloid regarding Kelly, it is worth noting that the publication has previously peddled unfounded claims, such as the ongoing conspiracy theory that Elvis Presley is still alive and the baseless allegation that Ted Cruz's father was involved in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. While it is essential to take all accusations seriously, Kelly can draw reassurance from the fact that the National Enquirer's track record is riddled with unsubstantiated stories, which may undermine the credibility of their latest allegations."

Kardashian momager Kris, who is said to have known about Jenner’s surgery in advance, has vowed to stop the shoot from going ahead, according to the insider.  ‘She knew the surgery was inevitable and it was bound to happen,’ said the source. ‘But she says she will do everything in her power to stop the shoot if she can.'

Jenner first announced her transition in an interview with Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July.  The headline-making ‘I am Cait’ shoot was said to have taken the Kardashian clan by surprise at the time and led to tension between Jenner and Kim, 36, as a result.  Nevertheless, the family have been publicly supportive of her decision to transition, which was completed in January according leaked extracts from her memoir.  Jenner wrote of the $20,000 operation: 'The surgery was a success, and I feel not only wonderful but liberated […] I am going to live authentically for the first time in my life.  ‘I am going to have an enthusiasm for life that I have not had in 39 years since the Olympics, almost two thirds of my life.'

The potential photo shoot would be a bold move for Jenner, who has become an icon for the transgender community since publicly revealing her transition in 2015. A source close to Jenner told DailyMail.com that the star is ‘seriously considering’ the idea, which was suggested to her by a well-known photographer.

Jenner is no stranger to the world of fashion and has previously appeared on the cover of Vanity Fair wearing a corset, but this would be her first fully nude photo shoot. The source said: ‘Caitlyn is a very proud woman and she wants to show off her new body. She feels that being transgender is a beautiful thing and she wants to celebrate that.’

The photo shoot would likely be a high-profile event and could spark a renewed debate about the portrayal of transgender people in the media. Jenner’s transition has been widely documented and has brought transgender issues into the mainstream.

But not everyone in the transgender community is likely to support the idea of a nude photo shoot. Some activists argue that the portrayal of transgender people as sexual objects can reinforce stereotypes and contribute to discrimination.

Jenner has yet to make a final decision on whether to go ahead with the photo shoot, and is seeking the advice of close friends and family members. The source added: ‘Caitlyn is a very private person, but she’s also a trailblazer and wants to do something that will help others. She’s seriously considering it, but she’s not sure if it’s the right thing to do.’"

gossipcop-12955535,1,0,"The FCC has decided against taking any action on Stephen Colbert’s May 1 Late Show broadcast, in which he treated President Donald Trump to a series of increasingly Rabelaisian insults, in response to on-air insults Trump had delivered earlier in the day to CBS News-man John Dickerson.  Colbert’s slew of frat-boy remarks culminated in a crack that the only thing Trump’s mouth is good for “is being Vladimir Putin’s [expletive] holster.” The naughty word was bleeped in the broadcast, and Colbert’s mouth was pixelated. But, intrepid journalists, who are paid to ferret out the truth, discovered what was the word, and they printed it – minus the offending syllable, of course.  All hell broke loose.  Trump called Colbert “no-talent guy.” Colbert’s monologue was plastered by some as inappropriately vulgar, by others as homophobic. The FCC received thousands of complaints. Reporters breathlessly reported Colbert was under FCC investigation, and a good time was had by all.  Today, however, the FCC put an end to the fun, saying in a statement: “Consistent with standard operating procedure, the FCC’s Enforcement Bureau has reviewed the complaints and the material that was the subject of these complaints.”  “The Bureau has concluded that there was nothing actionable under the FCC’s rules.”  In rough numbers, the FCC was saying that programs airing on broadcast TV stations before 10 PM are subject to fine if the commission determines they are “indecent.” Shows that run in late-night, however, have a different threshold: content must be ruled “obscene” for stations to be fined. FCC defines obscene as content that “must appeal to an average person’s prurient interest; depict or describe sexual conduct in a ‘patently offensive’ way; and, taken as a whole, lack serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.”  Here’s the monologue that launched a thousand complaints:","In a statement released on Friday, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said the Commission had “thoroughly reviewed” the May 1 episode of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, and had “concluded that there was nothing of sufficient gravity in the program to warrant further investigation or any regulatory action.”

Pai’s statement noted that while the FCC has a longstanding policy prohibiting the use of obscene or indecent language on broadcast television and radio during certain hours, the agency must also weigh the importance of free speech and the right to express critical opinions of public figures.

“While the Commission takes very seriously its obligation to enforce the law and protect the public from indecent content, we also have an obligation to protect the First Amendment rights of broadcasters and their audiences,” Pai said. “In this case, we have determined that Mr. Colbert’s use of satire and comedy to express his political opinions does not rise to the level of a violation of our rules.”

The FCC’s decision not to take action comes after weeks of speculation and mounting public pressure, with many calling for the agency to sanction Colbert and his network, CBS. Colbert’s monologue, in which he employed a series of crude metaphors to mock the president, attracted widespread attention and generated significant controversy.

In his statement, Pai acknowledged the strong feelings on both sides of the issue, but emphasized the importance of upholding the principles of free speech.

“The United States has a long and proud tradition of political satire and humor, and we believe that Mr. Colbert’s comments, while provocative, were not in violation of our rules,” Pai said. “At the same time, we encourage all broadcasters to be mindful of the standards set forth in our rules and to strive to maintain a level of discourse that is appropriate for a diverse and democratic society.”"

Just days after announcing her split from husband Kanye West, Kim Kardashian is making it clear that she's not planning on hiding herself away anytime soon. The reality TV star, who rose to fame thanks to her curvaceous figure and penchant for selfies, has been posting a series of sultry snaps on her social media accounts, each one more revealing than the last.

In one particularly racy photo, Kardashian is seen wearing a barely-there leotard, her ample assets on full display. In another, she poses in a skintight dress that leaves little to the imagination. Not one to shy away from flaunting her curves, the 34-year-old is certainly making a statement with her latest Instagram posts.

But it's not just her choice of attire that has people talking. Kardashian's unapologetic attitude towards her body and her life choices has always been a part of her appeal, and it seems that this latest chapter in her life is no exception. In a recent interview, she told reporters that she has ""no time for haters"" and that she's ""going to live her life the way she wants to.""

Fans and critics alike have been quick to speculate about the timing of Kardashian's social media comeback, with some suggesting that it's a strategic move to regain control of her narrative following the breakup. Others, however, have applauded her for her confidence and her refusal to be defined by the opinions of others.

RELATED: Blake Griffin Trade Gets Social Media Talking, And He Even Gets In A Classic Comment  Between the Kardashians’ reality show and paparazzi buzzing around, could there really be a Kardashian curse?  Kim and Khloe both married and divorced NBA players who saw better days on the court before marrying into the family, thrusting their lives into the spotlight.  Fan favorite Lamar Odom was traded from the Lakers to the Dallas Mavericks in 2011. His career then went downhill and then he almost died of a drug overdose while married to Khloe.  Kim was married to New Jersey Nets player Kris Humphries for just 72 days. He has played for four different NBA teams since the well-documented brief marriage.","The five-time All-Star and former No. 1 overall draft pick has been beset by injuries in recent years, and now finds himself on his third team after the Los Angeles Clippers traded him to the Pistons for a package that included a 2021 first-round draft pick and multiple players.

As Griffin prepares to join the Pistons, some are wondering if his body is breaking down and if his career is on the decline. Others, however, point to his relationship with the Kardashian family as a potential distraction. Griffin has been linked to reality TV star Kendall Jenner, who is part of the famed Kardashian clan.

Griffin, who signed a massive five-year, $173 million contract extension with the Clippers in 2017, has played in just 214 games since then, including only 47 last season due to a left knee injury. He also missed significant time in 2018-19 with a sore left knee and a right knee injury.

But Pistons head coach Dwane Casey, who was hired this offseason, told reporters that he believes Griffin still has a lot to offer.

“I think it’s a great opportunity for us to get a proven player who’s still in his prime,” Casey said. “He’s not only a great player, but a great person, a great professional. I think it’s a win-win for both sides.”

Griffin has averaged 21.6 points, 7.9 rebounds and 5.2 assists per game in his career, but whether he can regain his All-Star form remains to be seen."

A source close to the couple revealed that Selena Gomez had to make the difficult decision to walk away from Justin Bieber when he couldn’t promise her a serious future that included marriage.

New Idea claims that the Legally Blonde star is unhappy with her Australian, Big Little Lies co-star’s failure to promote the HBO series in the run-up to its debut in February, claiming that Nicole used too much of her airtime to discuss her latest Hollywood hit, Lion.  “Reese is furious that Nicole hasn’t done more to support Big Little Lies. All she talked about in the interviews was Lion. Had Reese known that Nicole would put the show so far on the back-burner, she would have cast some random person in the show,” Daily Mail quoted a source as saying.  Red carpet roundup: Golden girls at Oscars 2017  In Australia, Big Little Lies‘ debut outranked any HBO series broadcast on Foxtel in a launch week, more than doubling the audience that tuned in to see Game of Thrones‘ first-ever episode.  But New Idea suggests that it’s the underwhelming reception in her own home country that has left Reese disappointed. Reese is one of the executive producers for the show after all.  According to the publication, frosty relations between the pair manifested themselves at the Oscars last month. “You could cut the tension with a knife at the Oscars. Nicole was telling her people to keep Reese away from her,” claimed the source.  News of the pair being involved in “some tense arguments” during filming were also reported by the publication, which alleged that the Hollywood heavyweights may never work together again.  An insider claimed, “If the show doesn’t make any waves or get better ratings, it will probably mark the end of Reese and Nicole’s joint ventures.”  However, a representative of Daily Mail Australia says the story is completely incorrect. “Everyone is thrilled to the back teeth with Big Little Lies. They’re (Reese and Nicole) great friends, they love each other and they love the way each other works.”  Another source has denied New Idea’s claims that Nicole had not been promoting the show as much as fellow cast members, saying that the 49-year-old did a ‘shed load’ of publicity both in America and abroad. The report comes just two months after she spoke about the actresses’ friendship in California. “We’re very, very close friends. We’re able to talk about everything,” she said.

Title: Tiffany Haddish's Unconventional Approach to Diversity in Hollywood

Introduction:
In an industry that is often criticized for its lack of diversity, actress Tiffany Haddish is taking a unique approach to break down barriers. A year ago, she revealed her interest in playing caucasian women in her upcoming projects.

Body:
Tiffany Haddish, known for her roles in movies like 'Girls Trip' and 'Night School', has been an advocate for diversity in Hollywood. In her 2018 autobiography, 'She Ready! From the Hood to Hollywood', she openly discussed her desire to play caucasian women in her future projects. This unconventional approach aims to challenge the stereotypes and biases that exist in the industry.

Haddish believes that by playing caucasian women, she can showcase her acting abilities and prove that women of color are just as capable as their caucasian counterparts. In an interview, she mentioned that, ""By playing these roles, I hope to inspire other actresses of color to take on roles that are not necessarily written for them. It's time for Hollywood to recognize the talent and versatility of actresses of color.""

Conclusion:
Tiffany Haddish's willingness to take on roles of caucasian women is a bold move in the pursuit of greater diversity in Hollywood. By challenging the status quo, she is paving the way for other actresses of color to follow in her footsteps. This unconventional approach not only highlights her acting abilities but also contributes to the ongoing conversation about diversity and representation in the entertainment industry."

The 33-year-old singer was photographed lounging on the beach and taking a dip in the ocean with the women, who were reportedly friends of Jonas. The pictures, which surfaced online, show Jonas laughing and chatting with the group, creating an image of camaraderie and fun.

However, fans of the couple were quick to notice that Turner, who is well-known for her roles in the ""X-Men"" and ""Game of Thrones"" series, was not among the group. This has led to speculation about the state of their relationship, with some questioning whether the pair has hit a rough patch.

A source close to the couple has since come forward to quash these rumors, stating that Jonas and Turner have a strong relationship and that the absence was simply due to Turner's busy schedule. The insider added that the pair values their individual career pursuits and supports each other's endeavors.

Despite the reassurances, the internet has been abuzz with comments and speculations about the status of their relationship. Some fans have expressed concern, while others have taken the opportunity to criticize the couple for their perceived lack of commitment to each other.

It is worth noting that Jonas and Turner have been known to spend time apart due to their busy schedules, and they have previously addressed the challenges of maintaining a long-distance relationship. As such, the recent photos should not necessarily be taken as a sign of trouble in their marriage."

After playing 150 concerts across 40 countries during the world tour, Bieber cancelled the final 14, saying he was “just resting, getting some relaxation”. In a message on Instagram, he has elaborated on his reasons.  “I’ve learned the more you appreciate your calling the more you want to protect your calling,” he wrote. “Me taking this time right now is me saying I want to be SUSTAINABLE... so that I can be the man I want to be, the husband I eventually want to be, and the father I want to be.”  Perhaps referring to the string of fractious incidents he has been involved with, including punching a Spanish fan, driving drunk in a Lamborghini and being banned from China, he added: “Learning and growing hasn’t always been easy but knowing I’m not alone has kept me going. I have let my insecurities get the best of me at times, I let my broken relationships dictate the way I acted toward people and the way I treated them. I let bitterness, jealousy and fear run my life.!!!! ... What I’m not gonna do is be ashamed of my mistakes.

Justin Bieber has abruptly cancelled the remainder of his highly successful Purpose world tour, leaving fans around the globe reeling from the unexpected announcement.

In a lengthy Instagram post, the 23-year-old pop sensation cited exhaustion and a desire to put his personal wellbeing first as the reasons behind the cancellation. ""I want my mind heart and soul to be sustainable,"" Bieber wrote, alluding to the mental and emotional toll that the relentless tour schedule had taken on him.

The Purpose tour, which kicked off in March 2016, has been one of the most successful in recent history, with Bieber performing over 150 shows across six continents. However, the non-stop nature of the tour appears to have taken its toll on the Canadian singer, who has been open in the past about his struggles with fame and mental health.

In his statement, Bieber apologised to his fans for any inconvenience caused by the cancellation and thanked them for their understanding. ""I am grateful for the experience and the amazing memories we have shared throughout this journey,"" he wrote. ""But I am excited to just rest, recover and focus on what I need to focus on.""

The announcement has sent ripples through the music industry, with many industry insiders praising Bieber for prioritising his mental health in an industry that often demands constant output and perfection.

As fans come to terms with the news, the question now turns to what's next for Bieber, who has been rumoured to be working on new music. With his last album, Purpose, released in 2015, fans are eager for an update on when they can expect to hear new material from the singer."

While “normal” people are pressured by friends and family to get pregnant, celebrities are pressured by the whole world. And compared to other celebs, nobody has been more publicly pressured than Jennifer Aniston. The world is obsessed with her having a baby!  MORE: JENNIFER ANISTON’S AND JUSTIN THEROUX’S DOG CUSTODY BATTLE  It seems like no one has been reported pregnant more times than Jen.The earliest reports date back to 1999, back when the world first fell in love with her on Friends and she began dating Brad Pitt. Since 1999 there have been more than 55 published articles about her being pregnant both in and outside the U.S. It was even reported by the Huffington Post that despite the possibility that the U.S would go into war “Jennifer Aniston Pregnant” was still searched more than “are we at war” on Google.  Jennifer did express in early interviews that she wanted to become a mother one day and from then on the world was waiting. The obsession with her character on Friends—and the fact that Rachel did get pregnant—could be the reason why fans kept a close eye on is she or isn’t she in real life. In fact, the roles Jennifer took on in her career often had a direct impact on when and how her pregnancy rumors evolved.  Over time the extremity of the rumors changed, but many of the triggers are the same. Rumors start any time she is wearing a loose shirt or looks “bloated,” whenever she is in a new relationship, and whenever that relationship ends. And most importantly, the rumors evolve as she ages.  MORE: JENNIFER ANISTON BANS THE WORD “BABY” AROUND HER  Take a look at almost two decades worth of pregnancy rumors and how they progressed:","However, some female celebrities are proving that motherhood is not a prerequisite for success.

In a world where motherhood is often seen as a defining feature of womanhood, it is essential to recognize that not all women want to have children. This mindset is becoming increasingly accepted, with more and more women embracing their choices and pursuing their dreams without the constraints of societal expectations.

Celebrities, who are constantly under public scrutiny, often face immense pressure to conform to traditional gender roles. The media frequently perpetuates the narrative that a woman's worth is tied to her ability to bear children. However, some female celebrities are challenging this notion and proving that success and motherhood are not mutually exclusive.

Actress and singer, Jennifer Aniston, has been vocal about her choice not to have children. In a recent interview, she expressed her frustration with the constant speculation about her personal life, stating, ""I don't have kids, and I don't want to have kids, and it's not for a lack of trying."" Aniston's candidness about her decision has sparked a much-needed conversation about reproductive rights and the importance of supporting all women in their choices.

Singer and songwriter, Lorde, has also spoken out about her decision not to have children. In a 2021 interview, she said, ""Motherhood is a glorious and beautiful thing, and I think I’ll always want it, but I don’t think it’s the only thing that defines a woman."" Lorde's perspective highlights the need for a more inclusive understanding of womanhood, one that does not center solely around motherhood.

These high-profile examples demonstrate that women can achieve success and happiness without sacrificing their own identities and ambitions for the traditional role of motherhood. By embracing their choices and defying societal expectations, female celebrities are paving the way for a more inclusive and accepting world where women are free to define their own paths."

Five figures is a huge expense for a one-day affair. That is, unless you're ultra-rich — and especially if you're royalty rich.  Next month, the world will bear witness to the most anticipated royal wedding in years. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are set to be married on May 19 at St. George's Chapel, in Windsor, and will begin a carriage procession immediately after the ceremony. Their reception will take place later on the grounds of Windsor Castle.  Kensington Palace will cover the cost of the wedding, an expense traditionally taken on by the bride's family.  The case was the same for Kate Middleton and Prince William's 2011 royal wedding— the only item Middleton paid for was her six-figure Alexander McQueen dress. Their total wedding celebration cost $34 million (£23.7 million).  Markle and Prince Harry's wedding will reportedly cost in excess of $45.8 million (£32 million), according to Bride Book's estimation. That's over 1,000 more than the average wedding.  The venue is the biggest part of a typical wedding budget for couples in the US and the UK, taking up nearly half of the entire wedding cost. Access to St. George's Chapel — and St. George's Great Hall, where the wedding reception will take place — is free of charge for Markle and Prince Harry. Transportation is also free, thanks to the Queen's fleet of Rolls-Royces, Daimlers, and Bentleys.  The greatest cost for the royal couple? Security. Protecting Markle and Prince Harry, plus thousands of guests and onlookers, will run Kensington Palace a whopping $43 million (£30 million), estimates Bride Book. That includes the cost of snipers, undercover police, military technology, and security drones. The bulk of Kate Middleton and Prince William's wedding budget similarly went to security costs.  Otherwise, Markle and Prince Harry's total wedding spend, including food, cakes, entertainment, wardrobe, and the honeymoon, amounts to about $2.8 million.  Below, check out Bride Book's breakdown of what the royal wedding will cost.","However, when it comes to royalty, the price tag skyrockets. The upcoming royal wedding between Prince Harry and Meghan Markle is set to become one of the most expensive in history, with an estimated cost of $45 million (£30.5 million). This staggering figure includes expenses such as security, catering, entertainment, and the wedding dress. The couple's choice to invite over 2,000 members of the public to witness the ceremony at Windsor Castle also adds to the overall cost. Despite the hefty price tag, the royal family will reportedly cover the majority of the expenses, with taxpayers only footing the bill for security measures.

Gomez’s rekindled friendship with Justin Bieber, however, had nothing to do with the rapper’s decision to end his romance with the singer.  As Gossip Cop reported, Gomez and The Weeknd recently split after nearly a year of dating. The pair weren’t seen together much during the summer, though it was later revealed the singer-actress was laying low due to a kidney transplant. Regardless, they still appeared to be going strong in the early fall. Prior to the announcement of their breakup, the status of their relationship was questioned after it emerged Gomez had rekindled her friendship with Bieber. © Gossip Cop (Getty Images)  On Sunday, that speculation swirled as Bieber and Gomez were seen in public and The Weeknd stopped following her friends on social media. That being said, Bieber was allegedly not responsible for the breakup. Rather, it was the challenges of a long-distance relationship, particularly with The Weeknd touring and Gomez’s shooting schedule, that led both the former couple to reconsider their fizzling relationship.  Additionally, contributing to their split, the rapper felt “tied down” in a relationship that had lost its spark. Over time, the pair started talking less frequently on the phone, prompting The Weeknd to end his romance with Gomez, reports TMZ. Despite their breakup, we’re told that the pair are still on good terms and have talked several times since the split.  Predictably, after the rapper ended his relationship with Gomez, Gossip Cop busted the often disproven HollywoodLife for claiming in a made-up report that The Weeknd was “heartbroken” over Gomez reconnecting with Bieber. In the bogus story, the bad blog ridiculously asserted that The Weeknd and Gomez were caught in a “love triangle” with Bieber, but of course, the breakup had nothing to do with and wasn’t caused by the “Love Yourself” singer.

The pair first sparked dating rumors in January when they were spotted attending a Los Angeles church service together. They continued to make appearances as a couple throughout the year, including a red carpet debut at the Met Gala in May. As recently as October, the duo was seen enjoying a romantic getaway to Florence, Italy.

Despite the seemingly amicable nature of their breakup, fans of both stars are undoubtedly disappointed by the news. The Weeknd and Gomez have yet to publicly address the split, but Gossip Cop’s exclusive information indicates that the breakup was a mutual decision and that Bieber’s presence in Gomez’s life did not play a role in the decision."

She is WAITING for the summer just to show it off! Just to remind you, the article also called her a “blabbermouth”. And I don’t think it could be wrong. She blabbering about things that makes no sense. Maybe her excessive talking needed a halt and this quoted name of her may stop her from talking much now. Let’s see what the article had to say other than that. It said:  She has this weird sense of joy when she sees patches of cellulite on her thighs, hips and tummy. The sight of lumpy flesh doesn’t upset her. It makes her feel more feminine!  Maybe Caitlyn is trying to respect her body by respecting what she has. You can’t just disrespect your body for having a lumpy flesh. It is your body after all and if you disrespect it by yourself and obviously you can’t expect respect from others, can you? And who knows, maybe that lumpy dimpled flesh will look really feminine on her. It is creating a buzz in the media as this is not what you hear from a TV personality everyday. After all, every ordinary people might have cellulite in their body. It also said that Jenner’s view: “dimpled feminine flesh as a rite of passage into true womanhood.” and it was also reported that she wouldn’t mind having more cellulite in her body in future. The story features a zoomed-in photo of purported cellulite on Jenner’s leg. Also, after all these years of being a decathlete and going through dieting for years, the 67 year old Jenner might not want to do it anymore. “So let it be!” is what she might have been thinking. Also, the other reason maybe her daughter Kim’s cellulite pictures that surfaced online. This might just be a way to support her daughter.  Rumors or truth  This is not the only time some issues or sites posted a rumor about Caitlyn Jenner. Just last year, a issue of National Enquirer said that Jenner “wants her BIG, clunky-feet reduced to more lady-like proportions.” Again, this just a few days ago, radar online was on about exploring her sexuality online and enjoying a number of secret ‘cyber hookups’.

Short Bio on Caitlyn Jenner  Caitlyn Jenner is a decathlete turned TV personality. She is known by her previous name “Bruce Jenner”. The Olympic gold medal winner came out as a transgender in April 2015. She is the celebrity from the reality show “Keeping Up with Kardashians” along with her daughters. She has undergone a knee surgery before which she was a college football player for the Graceland Yellowjackets. More Bio…","Jenner, who has been the center of attention for her transition from male to female, has recently revealed that she feels more feminine due to cellulite on her legs.

""I have these dimples on my thighs and butt, and I think, 'Wow, I have cellulite!' But then I think, 'That's what makes me a woman,'"" said Jenner during an interview.

Cellulite, a common occurrence among women, is a condition where the skin appears to have areas with underlying fat deposits, giving it a dimpled, lumpy appearance. This condition is often considered unattractive, and many women go to great lengths to get rid of it. However, for Jenner, it seems to have a different significance.

Jenner has been vocal about her transition and has been an advocate for the LGBTQ community. She has also been a part of various reality TV shows, including Keeping Up with the Kardashians and I Am Cait.

""It's who I am,"" Jenner said about her decision to transition. ""To be honest with you, if I could do it all over again, I would do it faster.""

Jenner's revelation about embracing her cellulite has sparked a conversation about body positivity and self-acceptance. Many people have taken to social media to express their support and appreciation for Jenner's candidness.

""I think it's great that Caitlyn is embracing her femininity, even in the form of cellulite,"" said a Twitter user. ""It's a reminder that we should all love and accept ourselves, imperfections and all.""

Pitt is an honorary member of the Epidermolysis Bullosa Medical Research Foundation (EBMRF) that is dedicated to raising money and awareness for the rare skin disorder, epidermolysis bullosa.In January, Pitt introduced singer Chris Cornell during a Rock4EB annual charity to support EBMRF.Further, he revealed in a 2013 Esquire Magazine interview that he self-diagnosed himself with a rare disease – prosopagnosia — also known as face blindness. According to the article, ""Brad Pitt won't remember you. If you've met him, he'll have no idea who you are when he meets you again. Even if you've had what he calls ""a real conversation,"" your face will start fading from his memory as soon as you walk away.""It should be noted that being diagnosed with a condition and being self-diagnosed with a condition can be 2 very different diagnoses.Prosopagnosia refers to the inability to recognize familiar people from their face. They may also be unable to recognize other stimuli, such as objects, cars, or animals.People with prosopagnosia typically learn to use non-face cues including voice, walking style and hairstyle to recognize others. The underlying genetic cause of developmental prosopagnosia is not known but familial reports of this condition are consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance.Epidermolysis bullosa (aka 'the worst disease you've never heard of') is a group of devastating, life-threatening genetic skin disorders impacting children that is characterized by skin blisters and erosions all over the body.The most severe form, recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, is characterized by chronic skin blistering, open and painful wounds, joint contractures, esophageal strictures, pseudosyndactyly, corneal abrasions and a shortened life span. Patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa lack functional type VII collagen (C7) owing to mutations in the gene COL7A1 that encodes for C7 and is the main component of anchoring fibrils that attach the dermis to the epidermis.Epidermolysis bullosa patients suffer through intense pain throughout their lives, with no effective treatments available to reduce the severity of their symptoms.",".

What are the chances of having both prosopagnosia and epidermolysis bullosa?  A recent study conducted by researchers at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center has found that there is a rare genetic mutation that can cause both prosopagnosia, also known as face blindness, and epidermolysis bullosa, a group of rare genetic skin conditions that cause the skin to be fragile and easily blistered.

The study, published in the journal Nature Genetics, identified the genetic mutation that leads to the development of both conditions in a single individual. Researchers believe that this discovery could pave the way for new treatments and interventions for both conditions, as well as a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms that cause them.

""This study highlights the power of interdisciplinary research and the importance of collaboration between experts in different fields,"" said Dr. Ethan A. Lerner, a dermatologist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and one of the study's authors. ""By working together, we can make significant strides in our understanding of rare diseases and develop new ways to treat them.""

While the chances of having both prosopagnosia and epidermolysis bullosa are extremely rare, the discovery of the genetic mutation responsible for both conditions could have significant implications for the diagnosis and treatment of these conditions in the future. As researchers continue to explore the genetic basis of rare diseases, it is likely that more such associations will be discovered, leading to a better understanding of the underlying causes of these conditions and ultimately paving the way for new treatments and interventions."

What about the fact they came charging with clubs in their hands?"" Trump said he couldn't make a condemnation of hate groups earlier because he didn't ""know all the facts"" about an alleged white nationalist who crashed a car into a crowd of protesters, killing one person and wounded 19 others. CLOSE From Trump Tower in New York City, President Trump told reporters that both sides were to blame for the violence that occurred in Charlottesville, Virginia. USA TODAY ""I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct,"" Trump said from Trump Tower in New York, after an event that was intended to be devoted to a new infrastructure executive order. Trump has been especially quick to denounce previous terrorist attacks, including those taking place overseas. Yet he was notably reticent to pinpoint the blame for one on Saturday that involved white supremacists – a point his critics on both sides of the aisle continued to hammer. ""We must be clear. White supremacy is repulsive. This bigotry is counter to all this country stands for. There can be no moral ambiguity,” said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. added: ""There is only one side to be on when a white supremacist mob brutalizes and murders in America.” Several lawmakers were dismayed the president appeared to equate white supremacists with their opponents. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., tweeted: ""Blaming 'both sides' for #Charlottesville?! No. Back to relativism when dealing with KKK, Nazi sympathizers, white supremacists? Just no."" Another Republican, Rep. Charlie Dent from Pennsylvania, said Trump ""must stop the moral equivalency! AGAIN."" Over the weekend, Trump faced heavy criticism from both Republicans and Democrats for chiding ""many sides"" for their role in the violence in Charlottesville on Saturday, a statement many regarded as tepid toward racists. A full two days later, on Monday, Trump at the White House directly condemned the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists and announced the Justice Department would open up a civil rights investigation into the driver of the car that killed Charlottesville resident Heather Heyer. Yet on Tuesday, amid questions about whether Trump meant the words behind his most recent scripted statement, the president called his initial response ""fine"" and blamed the press for being dishonest in its coverage. ""There was no way of making a correct statement that early,"" he said at one point. ""I had to see the facts. Unlike a lot of reporters – I didn't know (prominent white supremacist) David Duke was there. I wanted to see the facts."" For his part, former KKK leader Duke tweeted a thank you to the president after his statement Tuesday – for condemning ""the leftist terrorists"" in Black Lives Matter and Antifa.","Trump Stands by Remarks on Charlottesville Violence, Drawing Ire From Both Sides

President Donald Trump sparked a fresh wave of outrage on Tuesday when he doubled down on his initial statement regarding the deadly violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the weekend. Speaking from his Trump Tower in New York City, Mr. Trump told reporters that he believed both protesters and counter-protesters were to blame for the unrest that led to the death of a 32-year-old woman and injured dozens of others.

The president's remarks, which came during a press conference that was supposed to focus on infrastructure, were met with swift and strong condemnation from both Republicans and Democrats. Critics argue that Mr. Trump's assertion that there were ""fine people"" among the white nationalists and neo-Nazis who descended on Charlottesville to protest the removal of a Confederate statue, only serves to legitimize hate groups.

In a statement, House Speaker Paul Ryan said, ""White supremacy is repulsive. This bigotry is counter to all this country stands for. There can be no moral ambiguity."" Senator John McCain added, ""There's no moral equivalency between racists & Americans standing up to defy hate & bigotry. The President of the United States should say so.""

Meanwhile, activists and civil rights organizations have planned more protests across the country, demanding that the president unequivocally denounce white supremacy and hate groups. Some business leaders, including the CEOs of Merck, Intel, and Under Armour, have stepped down from White House advisory councils in response to Mr. Trump's remarks.

As the controversy continues to swirl, the White House has found itself once again on the defensive, struggling to contain the fallout from a president who seems unwilling to unequivocally condemn the forces of hate that have been emboldened by his rhetoric."

Whenever Mariah decides to get married, don’t forget about us when it comes to the wedding invitations!  This alleged engagement would be the third time Mariah walked down the aisle, as she was previously married to Tommy Mottola, 68, and Nick Cannon, 37. After dealing with a pair of heartbreakers, MiMi isn’t fooling around, especially when it comes to her $520 million fortune. She’s working on an ironclad prenup, according to OK! magazine. “She’s had tow failed marriages already,” the source says. “She’s not going to take any risks here.” Speaking of Nick, expect to see him during Mariah’s big day.  Nick and Mariah’s twins – son Morocco and daughter Monroe, 6 – will be featured in his wedding, and sources say Mariah’s thinking of asking Nick to walk her down the aisle. “[He] will always be a big part of her life,” the source added. Considering Mariah, Nick and the twins recently made an adorable appearance at the 2018 Kids’ Choice Awards, it makes total sense that Mariah’s ex would be on hand to see her say “I Do” again.","**Title:** Mariah Carey's Wedding Bells: Iconic Singer Set to Marry Bryan Tanaka

Terms & Privacy","In a move that is both a nod to her detractors and a clever way to cash in on her newfound viral fame, Carey has launched a line of T-shirts featuring her infamous “I don’t know her” quote from the now-legendary incident. The shirts, which retail for $30 each, have been selling like hotcakes since they went on sale earlier this week.

Carey has been no stranger to internet fame over the years, but this time around, she’s embracing it full force. In a recent interview, she said, “I’m not one to let a good meme go to waste. Plus, it’s a fun way to connect with my fans.”

But not everyone is a fan of the new merch. Critics argue that Carey is capitalizing on a joke at her own expense, and that the shirts perpetuate a negative stereotype of her as a diva. Carey, however, remains unfazed by the backlash. “People are going to talk about me regardless, so I might as well make some money off of it,” she said with a shrug.

While the T-shirts may not silence her detractors, they have certainly generated buzz and added a new chapter to the Mariah Carey internet phenomenon. Whether you love her or love to hate her, one thing is for sure: Mariah Carey knows how to stay relevant in the digital age."
gossipcop-3308884181,1,1,"Beyoncé Rumored To Be Asking For Silent Delivery  As the countdown to Blueprint 1 and Blueprint 2’s arrival continues, the stories about Bey’s birth plans abound. First, we heard she planned to give birth at home, then they said her security has been running weekly drills to practice their approach to Cedars-Sinai and now there’s a report that Bey wants silence in the delivery room.  According to Naughty Gossip reports:  “Beyoncé likes peace and calm around her. She has zero time for drama and gossip. She likes her inner circle to be soft spoken if they have to talk at all. And you can expect the same will be true when she gives birth to the twins,” sources tell Straight Shuter. “You can only get into her private life if you are invited. She is very guarded and protects her privacy at all cost. She likes to be surrounded with peaceful colors and soft sounds. This will be of utmost importance for her when giving birth.”  This story is almost like opening up a fortune cookie or visiting your average storefront psychic. EVERYBODY knows Beyoncé is private. THAT doesn’t take an exclusive source to figure out.  Silent birth is a real thing though – something that Scientologists practice and Katie Holmes even did when she gave birth to Suri, but as much as Bey loves music we don’t really see her doing a silent birth.  Speaking of Bey’s love of music… Hit the flip for some recently posted pics of her from a Michael Jackson/Prince party.  GettyImages/Instagram","The latest rumor?  That Queen Bey is asking for a silent delivery.  While it’s not uncommon for celebrities to request a bit of privacy during their hospital stay, this request takes it to a whole new level.  Sources close to the situation say that Beyoncé is asking for a completely silent delivery—no talking, no noise whatsoever.  That means no doctors or nurses speaking, no monitors beeping, and no visitors making a peep.  It’s all part of her plan to create a serene, zen-like atmosphere for the birth of her twins.  Some medical professionals have raised concerns about how feasible this request is, but others say that it’s possible to achieve with some advanced planning and coordination.  Whether or not the silent delivery will actually happen remains to be seen, but one thing’s for sure—Beyoncé is determined to make her twins’ birthday a memorable one."

Jenner, 67, completed gender reassignment surgery in January, according to her new memoir, ‘The Secrets of My Life’. The photo shoot promises to be Caitlyn's finest hour since she first announced her transition in an interview with ABC’s Diane Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July.  Although the Kardashian-Jenner clan is said to be ‘wholly supportive’ of Jenner’s transition, sources close to the family say the prospect of a nude shoot is ‘their worst nightmare’.  Caitlyn Jenner, 67, completed gender reassignment surgery in January, according her memoir, ‘The Secrets of My Life’. The photo shoot promises to be Caitlyn's finest hour since she first announced her transition in an interview with ABC’s Diane Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July  Although the Kardashian-Jenner clan is said to be ‘wholly supportive’ of Jenner’s transition, sources close to the family say the prospect of a nude shoot is ‘their worst nightmare’  An insider tells DailyMail.com that the Kardashians learned of the 67-year-old’s plan from her model son Brody, 33.  ‘Brody told them that Caitlyn has planned and booked a full nude photo shoot and they were like, that’s unacceptable, it’s taking things too far,' the source said.  ‘They’re hoping the shoot doesn't come to pass because that would be their worst nightmare. Taking it to that level and unveiling her [new body] with a fully naked photo spread is going way too far.'  Kardashian momager Kris, who is said to have known about Jenner’s surgery in advance, has vowed to stop the shoot from going ahead, according to the insider.  ‘She knew the surgery was inevitable and it was bound to happen,’ said the source. ‘But she says she will do everything in her power to stop the shoot if she can.'  DailyMail.com has approached representatives for Jenner and the Kardashians for comment. Jenner's rep knew nothing about it.  Jenner first announced her transition in an interview with Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July.  The headline-making ‘I am Cait’ shoot was said to have taken the Kardashian clan by surprise at the time and led to tension between Jenner and Kim, 36, as a result.  Nevertheless, the family have been publicly supportive of her decision to transition, which was completed in January according leaked extracts from her memoir.  Jenner wrote of the $20,000 operation: 'The surgery was a success, and I feel not only wonderful but liberated […] I am going to live authentically for the first time in my life.  ‘I am going to have an enthusiasm for life that I have not had in 39 years since the Olympics, almost two thirds of my life.'  But the book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife and step-children.  Sources close to the family told DailyMail.com that Jenner’s ‘unpredictable’ behavior has also played a part in their current estrangement.  The insider said: ‘[The book] is definitely something that she’s wanted to do for a while and it was just a matter of time before she got it done.  ‘But the family were like, it’s probably going to reopen the drama of everything [that has happened].  ‘They were worried because she’s been so unpredictable lately and just trying to get out into the limelight.’  Jenner's book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife  A second leaked extract from the memoir has already proven embarrassing, after Jenner claimed the late Robert Kardashian knew O.J.

The former Olympian, who won gold in the decathlon at the 1976 Montreal Games, revealed in her 2015 Vanity Fair cover story that she was transitioning from male to female. Now, Jenner is reportedly planning to pose nude in a high-profile magazine spread, in a bid to ‘push boundaries and raise awareness for the transgender community’.

A source close to the situation revealed: ‘Caitlyn is finally comfortable with her body and wants to show it off. She’s been working out and is in the best shape of her life. Caitlyn believes that posing nude will help her make a statement about body positivity and the transgender experience. She wants to show that transgender women can be sexy and beautiful too.’

The photo shoot is reportedly scheduled to take place later this month, with a major fashion photographer on board to capture the historic moment. The source added: ‘Caitlyn is very excited about the shoot and is confident that it will create a buzz. She’s always been a trailblazer and she’s eager to continue that tradition.’

Jenner’s representatives have not yet commented on the report, but the news comes just weeks after the release of her memoir, which details her journey from Bruce to Caitlyn, as well as her struggles with gender identity and her high-profile divorce from Kris Jenner.

In recent months, Jenner has been vocal about her support for the transgender community, particularly following the Trump administration’s decision to reverse the Obama-era guidance on transgender students’ bathroom access.

As she continues to make strides in her personal and professional life, Jenner’s reported nude photo shoot will undoubtedly spark conversation and further debate about transgender rights and acceptance in society."
gossipcop-6742180407,1,0,"It was a humid 84 degrees in Bridgehampton on Saturday, but that didn’t stop a crowd of people from descending upon Topping Rose House for Jill Zarin’s annual luncheon. The former Real Housewife of New York, ran around the grounds in an A-line Carolina Herrera dress, posing on the step-and-repeat, taking photos with fans, and catching up with old friends. Trying to track her down for an interview turned into a scavenger hunt.  Scattered around the lawn were tables for vendors selling everything from wine to sex toys. There was a station for guests to get a vitamin infusion, with seats in the direct line of the sun transforming the spot into an inescapable sauna-I.V. drip hybrid. Housewives from across the country flew into town for the occasion (Vicki Gunvalson of Orange County and LeeAnne Locken of Dallas), which also served as a benefit for Thyroid Cancer Research in honor of Zarin’s late husband, Bobby, who died of the disease in January.  Upon first try to flag Zarin down for a couple of questions, she sent over her daughter, Ally Shapiro, in her stead. Shapiro reflected on last year’s luncheon, when her stepfather was still struggling with cancer, but encouraged her and her mother to party on.  “He loved drinking and partying. This was the highlight of his year,” she said. “It was this time last year that we were told he wasn’t gonna make it another week, and he pushed us and he said, ‘Go to the party. Maybe I won’t be here when you come back, but go.’”  Shapiro, who now lives in London while she works on her master’s degree, admits that she can’t watch old episodes of Real Housewives, which showed her as 14-year-old struggling to get close to her stepfather. “You want to think that it’s like a home movie, but it’s not. That’s not what our relationship was like,” she said, adding that the reruns play constantly in the U.K. “I’m walking down the street and someone’s like, ‘Oh my God, I just saw you trying on a prom dress!’”  She also said that her mother is dabbling with dating, specifically with a man she plays tennis with. “It’s fun, and I live in London so it’s good for her to have a distraction.”  Dina Lohan, dressed in a metallic green blazer and shorts set and a pair of oversized aviators, arrived fashionably late to the affair, but was immediately greeted by hoards of people trying to chat her up or get a photo. Eventually secured in the same spot for more than a few seconds, she was willing to talk about her daughter Lindsay’s upcoming project for MTV, a Vanderpump Rules–inspired reality show that follows Lindsay and the employees of her new Lohan Beach Club. Bunim/Murray Productions is producing the series, the same company that produced Lohan’s E! reality show Living Lohan a decade ago.  “These kids were like, babies, and now they’re running the show,” she said of the crew. “They lived in my house! And now they’re all corporate. . . . We’re home. It’s cyclical, you know.”  Lohan also revealed that the upcoming series is a bit of a family affair with Lindsay’s younger sister, 24-year-old Ali, providing the theme song.  A friend of Lohan’s interjected, asking if Ali, like her older sister over a decade ago, had moved out to L.A. for work.  “She’s in New York with me,” the matriarch answered. “I keep them close! I’m not going to lose someone to L.A., no. Not again!”  Finally, the woman of the hour managed to stop and take a breath. While Zarin may no longer be a Bravo housewife, she still knows how to schmooze like one. She’s been keeping up with the latest season of the show here and there, and even received a good-luck message from Luann de Lesseps, who checked into rehab earlier in the month, wishing her good luck on the event. Having brought me up to speed, Zarin closed our conversation with a plug for her new line of “pet-proof, gorgeous, and inexpensive” rugs, aptly titled Jill Zarin Rugs.

Despite the heat, a large crowd of people gathered at Topping Rose House for Jill Zarin's annual luncheon.

The event, which is a popular social affair, brought together a diverse group of attendees, including locals and visitors from nearby cities. Guests enjoyed a delicious meal and participated in lively conversations, while some also took the opportunity to explore the beautiful gardens surrounding the venue.

Zarin, a well-known television personality and entrepreneur, was delighted to see such a large turnout for her event. In her address to the gathering, she expressed her gratitude for the support she has received from the community over the years.

The luncheon also served as a platform to raise awareness and funds for a local charity organization. A silent auction was held, featuring an array of exclusive items and experiences, with all proceeds going to the charity.

Overall, Jill Zarin's annual luncheon was a resounding success, with participants enjoying a day of socializing, delicious food, and philanthropy in the picturesque setting of Topping Rose House."

The 20-year-old cosmetics guru — who is expecting her first child, a baby girl, with boyfriend Travis Scott — did not appear in any photos from the bash shared to social media by KarJenner family members. But a source tells PEOPLE she was there celebrating away from the cameras.  “Kylie looked great but didn’t really draw any attention to her baby bump,” the source says. “She still acts like she wants to keep her pregnancy private.”  Meanwhile, her sister Khloé Kardashian, — who earlier this week confirmed that she and boyfriend Tristan Thompson are expecting their first child together — accentuated her own baby bump in a skin-tight, sparkly jumpsuit with a white fur coat.  “Khloé was beaming all night,” the insider says of the 33-year-old Revenge Body host. “She kept touching and showing off her cute baby belly.”  Khloé showed off her bump on Instagram as well.  “Merry Christmas!! May you sparkle and shine this festive season, may all of your wishes and dreams come true,” Khloé captioned a gallery of shots showing her touching her belly. “I pray that we all may feel this happiness all year round. God bless you! ✨ #BabyBump🤗”  “Merry Christmas!!!!!

Kourtney’s ex-boyfriend Scott Disick was there, too — without girlfriend Sofia Richie.  “He mingled, looked good and didn’t drink,” the source says, adding that there wasn’t any awkwardness with Kourtney’s new boyfriend Younes Bendjima.  “Kourtney seemed so happy that Younes joined her,” the insider says. “They are so cute together. He kept bringing her drinks and doting on her. Younes fits right into the family. He didn’t seem uncomfortable that Scott was there. They said hello, but that was it. It was very civil.”  Other guests included Kim’s husband Kanye West, celebrity hair stylists Jen Atkin and Chris Appleton, singer Christina Aguilera and Keeping Up with the Kardashians executive producer Ryan Seacrest. Kris appeared to be in a good mood throughout the night, dancing with Kim and Khloé and playing MC while Babyface, Toni Braxton and Brian McKnight performed.  “Everyone had the most amazing time,” the source tells PEOPLE. “Kris always throws the best parties. It was all gorgeous. There was no drama.”  Rob Kardashian and Khloé Kardashian Khloe Kardashian/Instagram  Kylie Jenner and Khloé Kardashian Khloe Kardashian/Instagram  On Christmas morning, the family gathered at Kourtney’s house to open presents and celebrate the holiday in matching elf-patterned onesies and beanies.  “Merry Christmas!

However, the 20-year-old reality star and cosmetics mogul made sure to attend her mother Kris Jenner's annual Christmas Eve party in Los Angeles, putting any speculation about a family feud to rest.

The festive event, which took place at the Jenner household on Saturday, December 24, was attended by various members of the Kardashian-Jenner family, including Kim Kardashian, Kourtney Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian, Kendall Jenner, and Kris Jenner herself. The family was all dressed up in their holiday best, and the party appeared to be a success, as evidenced by the numerous social media posts shared by the attendees.

Kylie's presence at the Christmas Eve party comes amid rumors of tension between her and her older sisters, particularly Kim, over business dealings and publicity strategies. The young entrepreneur has been keeping a relatively low profile in recent months, focusing on her booming cosmetics line and her rumored pregnancy.

Despite her absence from the Christmas card, Kylie's appearance at the Christmas Eve party reassures fans that the family is still united and that any rumored conflicts are likely nothing more than speculation. The Kardashian-Jenner family has always been known for their ability to set aside their differences and come together during the holidays, and this year seems to be no exception."

Two of Robert Kardashian's ex-wives have come forward saying he confided in them that he was unsure of the paternity of the now-27-year-old.  Jan Ashley, who married the businessman after Khloe's mother Kris Jenner, said: 'Khloe is not his kid -- he told me that after we got married.'  And Ellen Pierson, 63, who married Robert in 2003 just two months before his death, has also come forward after eight years of silence to 'tell the truth' about the Kardashian family.  Claims: Two of Robert Kardashian's ex-wives have come forward claiming the lawyer told them Khloe Kardashian, left, was not his real daughter, like older sisters Kim and Kourtney  The reality star has hit back at the claims, calling them 'really low'.  In an explosive interview with Star magazine, Ashley said: 'He just kind of looked at me and said [it] like it was a matter of fact. He said ""Well, you know that Khloe's not really a Kardashian, don't you?""    'And I said… ""OK"" and that was it.'  She claims Khloe, who is married to Dallas Mavericks basketballer Lamar Odom, knew she had a different father to her sisters and younger brother Rob.  'Khloe brought it up all the time. She looked nothing like the rest. She was tall, had a different shape, light hair, curly hair. Didn't look anything like the other three children.'  Different: Khloe has often pointed out that she looks nothing like her older sisters and their mother Kris, far right, said once people asked whether she was 'the milkman's child'  Fighting back: Khloe has responded to the claims today on Twitter She said Robert, who is of Armenian descent, had told her that he and Kris were not sleeping together at the time Khloe was conceived. '[But] he never would have considered a DNA test. He loved her very much. Robert did question the fact that Khloe was his,' Ellen said. 'Any normal man would if they knew their wife had cheated on him.' Khloe has responded to the claims today on Twitter.  Daddy's little girl: Robert Kardashian, pictured with Khloe as a child, referred to having four biological children in court documents filed in 1999 She wrote: 'The audacity you have to mention my father’s name like this! Should be ashamed of urself! I let a lot of things slide but this one is really low… YOU ARE DISGUSTING! (yes you know who YOU are).'    High-profile: Robert represented O.J. Simpson in his murder trial in 1994  Kris, 56, recently admitted in her new book that she cheated on Robert during their marriage.  Since Robert's death, Ellen had experienced financial difficulties, filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2010.  The home she and Robert shared in Indian Wells, California, was sold after going into foreclosure in October.  Kris remarried Olympian Bruce Jenner in 1991 and the couple had two daughters, Kendall and Kylie.  Bruce already had four children from two previous marriages: Burt, Casey, Brody, and Brandon.    Khloe is often talking about how she looks nothing like her sisters, and Kris has been quoted as saying people asked her whether she was 'the milkman's daughter' when she was born.    On Khloe's blog in June 2010, she shared a number of pictures of her and the attorney.  She wrote: 'Father’s Day is two days away, so in preparation I wanted to post this photo album (mostly old school pics) dedicated to my dad and to Bruce.  'I was seriously the luckiest girl in the world growing up because I had two amazing dads who not only loved us kids more than anything, but adored each other as well.  'My dad and Bruce were always really cl","Two of Robert Kardashian's ex-wives have come forward to allege that he privately expressed doubts over whether he was Khloe's biological father. This revelation comes just days after it was claimed that OJ Simpson, who was close to the family, could be her real dad.

Khloe, 34, reacted with fury to the claims on Twitter, branding her father's ex-wives 'disgusting' and 'low'. She wrote: 'The audacity you have to mention my father's name like this! Should be ashamed of yourselves! I let a lot of things slide but this is really below the belt.'

Mum Kris Jenner, 65, has previously admitted to having affairs during her marriage to the late Robert Kardashian, who passed away in 2003. She told Fox News in 2015: 'I had affairs, I was married to him, but I had affairs. I was not faithful to my husband.'

However, she has always maintained that Khloe is Robert's daughter.

The new claims have reignited the long-running debate over Khloe's parentage, which first surfaced in the wake of her 2014 divorce from basketball player Lamar Odom.

In 2017, a TV documentary claimed that OJ Simpson, who was close friends with Robert, could be her real father. The theory was based on the fact that both Khloe and OJ have dark hair, while the rest of the Kardashian family have lighter locks.

The claims come just weeks after it emerged that Kim Kardashian is studying to be a lawyer and plans to take the bar exam in 2023.

The Kardashian family has not yet commented on the latest claims about Khloe's paternity."

A new study has revealed a significant rise in the number of people seeking treatment for mental health issues, particularly among young adults. The research, conducted by the University of California, indicates that the increase in mental health cases can be attributed to factors such as stress, anxiety, and depression resulting from the ongoing political and economic turmoil.

In light of these findings, mental health experts are urging the government to allocate more resources to mental health services and to implement policies that promote a healthier work-life balance. They also emphasize the need for early intervention and prevention programs to address the root causes of mental health issues among the younger population.

gossipcop-5865271192,1,1,"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired. T","It's hard not to feel a bit sorry for Katie Holmes these days. According to a slew of recent reports, the former ""Dawson's Creek"" actress has been struggling to maintain a sense of balance in her personal life. From rumors about her relationship with boyfriend Jamie Foxx to speculation about her connections with ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri, it seems like Holmes just can't catch a break.

The most recent buzz surrounding Holmes and Foxx suggests that their relationship is on the rocks. Some reports claim that the couple has been arguing more frequently, while others speculate that they may have even called it quits. If true, this would be a significant blow for Holmes, who has long kept her personal life out of the spotlight.

Then there's the lingering question of her relationship with Cruise, who she was married to from 2006 to 2012. Although the two have been divorced for years, rumors about their relationship continue to make headlines. Some reports claim that Cruise is still deeply invested in Holmes' life, while others suggest that he has moved on and found love with his ""Top Gun"" co-star, Jennifer Connelly.

Of course, no discussion of Holmes' personal life would be complete without mentioning her daughter, Suri. Despite being the center of a highly publicized custody battle between Holmes and Cruise, Suri has grown into a poised and confident young woman. However, the ongoing speculation about her relationship with her mother must be challenging, to say the least.

In the face of all this scrutiny, one can't help but feel a bit of empathy for Katie Holmes. Here's hoping that she's able to find some peace and normalcy in her personal life, away from the glare of the tabloids."

gossipcop-2388806885,1,0,"R. Kelly’s time may have finally come. R. Kelly has been accused of sexual relationships with minors going back to 1994, when he married 15-year-old pop star Aaliyah. (The marriage was annulled.) In the 24 years since then, he has been sued multiple times for inappropriate sexual contact with a minor (he settled out of court every time), and he was eventually charged with creating child pornography. (A jury found him not guilty on the grounds that they could not conclusively identify the other figure in his infamous sex tape as a child.) Last summer, he was accused of creating an abusive “sex cult” of very young women, whom he allegedly isolates, brainwashes, and abuses physically and emotionally. Since the story broke, multiple women have added their own testimonies of abuse at R. Kelly’s hands. (Through a lawyer, Kelly denied all accusations, saying he would “work diligently and forcibly to pursue his accusers and clear his name.”) And in April, another woman accused Kelly of “knowingly and intentionally infecting her with an STD.” Her lawyers say they are currently preparing a federal civil lawsuit. Through a spokesperson, Kelly issued a statement to the Washington Post in which he “categorically denies all claims and allegations.” As man after man has fallen to the #MeToo reckoning, losing jobs and retiring from public life after being accused of sexual harassment and assault, there’s been a recurring whisper: What about R. Kelly? Despite decades of lawsuits and allegations, Kelly’s career has marched steadily on. Last year, he finished an arena tour with a few cancellations. This year, he’s touring with singer Charlie Wilson (some protests are planned). His music appeared in Pitch Perfect 3. At this year’s Coachella, rapper Vince Staples repeatedly referred to Kelly as a “child molester” in an interview with Complex, insisting, “He pees on people.” In our post-#MeToo, post-Time’s Up, post-Harvey Weinstein world, and given the sheer volume of allegations against Kelly, it seems reasonable to raise the question of why he continues to work as much as he does. But Staples’s interviewer only giggled nervously and protested, “We can’t ever talk about this guy. ... You’re about to get me fired from Coachella. It’s my first time here.” Later, Staples tweeted that “R. Kelly people is looking for me.” ladies and gentlemen, vince staples on r kelly pic.twitter.com/SmZdYu9PNJ — andy (@aboynamedandy) April 16, 2018 That stasis may be starting to change. Most of the claims against Kelly were reiterated in a recent BBC Three documentary, R Kelly: Sex, Girls & Videotapes. And over the past year, at least five members of Kelly’s inner circle have left him. His assistant, his accountant, his lawyer, and his rep have all said that they no longer work for him, although none of them have gone into detail about their departures and all have been supportive and complimentary toward Kelly in their statements. His longtime musical accompanist, DJ Phantom, was less circumspect about his decision to leave Kelly in December: “I didn’t know then what I know now,” he said. “He’s a shitbag.” In April, the Women of Color committee within Time’s Up threw its weight behind the #MuteRKelly campaign, calling for anyone currently profiting from Kelly and his music to drop him, including Spotify, Ticketmaster, and Kelly’s record label, RCA. Shortly thereafter, Spotify announced that it would no longer be promoting Kelly’s music, although his music would remain in their streaming catalog. It’s possible that these new developlments mean things are changing for Kelly, and that he’s about to face lasting consequences for those accusations. But if that’s the case, those consequences took more than two decades to reach him. There is a persistent vagueness to the way we talk about R. Kelly that makes it possible to forget exactly what he’s been accused of, how often he’s been accused, and how much proof there is against him. And most likely, that’s because his alleg","Despite these allegations, Kelly has continued to enjoy a successful career in music and has avoided any serious legal consequences. However, recent events may signal a turning point in the singer’s fortunes.

On Thursday, federal prosecutors in New York City unsealed a 13-count indictment against Kelly, accusing him of running a criminal enterprise that recruited women and girls to engage in sex acts with him. The indictment also alleges that Kelly and his associates paid off witnesses and victims to ensure their silence.

In addition to the charges in New York, Kelly is also facing charges in Chicago for allegedly sexually abusing minors. In recent months, numerous women have come forward with stories of abuse and manipulation by Kelly, leading to a renewed interest in the case and increased pressure on law enforcement to take action.

Kelly’s attorney, Steve Greenberg, has denied the allegations, saying that Kelly is innocent and that the charges are a rehash of previously discredited claims. However, the mounting evidence and the number of accusers suggest that Kelly’s time may finally be running out.

The case has attracted the attention of the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund, which provides legal support to victims of sexual harassment and abuse. The organization has called on anyone with information about Kelly’s behavior to come forward and has vowed to support the victims throughout the legal process.

In a statement, Tina Tchen, the president of the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund, said, “This indictment is a reminder of the perseverance of survivors and the importance of investigating and prosecuting sexual abuse, even when the perpetrator is a celebrity.”

As Kelly faces the possibility of spending the rest of his life in prison, it appears that his long-running career may finally be coming to an end. The question now is whether the legal system will finally deliver justice for the many victims who have come forward, or whether Kelly will once again manage to evade the consequences of his actions."

While being interviewed for Task & Purpose for his new movie “Patriots Day,” Wahlberg went after celebrities who “lined up to denounce Donald Trump is the months and weeks leading up to Election Day.”  “A lot of celebrities did, do, and shouldn’t,” he told the magazine. “You know, it just goes to show you that people aren’t listening to that anyways. They might buy your CD or watch your movie, but you don’t put food on their table. You don’t pay their bills.”  “A lot of Hollywood is living in a bubble,” Wahlberg continued. “They’re pretty out of touch with the common person, the everyday guy out there providing for their family. Me, I’m very aware of the real world. I come from the real world and I exist in the real world. And although I can navigate Hollywood and I love the business and the opportunities it’s afforded me, I also understand what it’s like not to have all that.”  Wahlberg’s point is well taken. What makes Hollywood liberals qualified to speak on politics? They should have respect for the President of the United States.  Do you agree?","Mark Wahlberg, who rose to fame as the frontman of the Funky Bunch in the early 1990s before transitioning into a successful acting career, has a message for fellow celebrities who oppose President Trump. In a recent interview, Wahlberg cautioned against alienating fans by voicing political opinions too strongly, stating, ""We're in the business of trying to entertain people and make people happy, so I try to stay away from politics.""

Wahlberg, who has been vocal about his faith and his commitment to philanthropy, emphasized the importance of focusing on the issues that unite rather than divide people. He added, ""I just don't think it's helpful for me to be talking about politics. I think it's important for people to make up their own minds and do their own research.""

The actor's comments come at a time when many in Hollywood have been vocal in their opposition to the Trump administration's policies. Wahlberg's message, however, underscores the delicate balance that celebrities must strike when discussing politics, as they risk alienating fans with differing viewpoints."

She’s currently on vacation with friends in Sydney, Australia, where she appears to be carefree in this new video. However, a source reveals that the same can’t be said for Bieber. “Justin has Selena on the brain constantly. He is trying to drown it out by hanging with friends and doing stuff on his own time but he keeps thinking about her,” a source EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com. “He always wants to be around her, talk to her and be with her. She is like a drug for him, he just needs more and more and more.”  As the Biebs continues to struggle with their time apart, he’s got a few things up his sleeve for when she returns to LA. “He can’t wait until she is back because he wants to really wine and dine her upon her return and really kick start the relationship back up again,” the insider reveals. It’s unclear when Sel is scheduled to return to the West Coast. But, as seen on her Instagram, she is having the time of her life. She posted a video which showed her laughing on a boat, accompanied by a subliminal message, that she “chose” to take care of herself, “not to prove anything to anyone.” Was she trying to give us insight into her most recent split with Bieber?  Jelena fans went into panic mode after seeing Sel in the arms of another man on a boat on March 19. She was photographed hugging and goofing off in photos with Sydney native, Johnny Rays.

While Sel has been vacationing Down Under, Bieber has been staying active. He’s been photographed playing hockey and soccer with friends. However, his emotions may be getting the best of him as he took a gnarly fall during a soccer game on March 19, and seemingly broke down on the sidelines of a hockey game on March 17.  As you may recall, Jelena reunited in October 2017, after her split with The Weeknd, 28. They seemed inseparable, having spent New Year’s together in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. However, their romance took a rocky turn around Bieber’s birthday on March 1, according to reports.","Justin Bieber is reportedly having a tough time coming to terms with his breakup with Selena Gomez, as the singer enjoys a carefree vacation in Australia.

gossipcop-28284230,1,0,"Not so fast! Madonna was hit with a series of “uncomfortable questions” by a judge before she was granted permission to adopt her 4-year-old twin girls from Malawi, the presiding judge said in court documents obtained by The Associated Press on Wednesday, February 8.  “The petitioner is a professional performer and I guarded myself against the danger of her merely reciting a well-rehearsed speech by asking her some rather uncomfortable questions to which she gave very candid answers,” Judge Fiona Mwale said in her ruling, explaining her reasons for approving the adoption.  After pressing Madonna, 58, to explain her intentions in adding two more little ones to her brood of four, Judge Mwale said she was satisfied that the girls would be in good hands with the Material Girl.  “There is no doubt that the petitioner can offer the infants not only the best education money can buy, but also guidance with a high likelihood of ensuring that the two infants grow to be self-sufficient adults,” Judge Mwale said, adding that she is satisfied that Madonna “is motivated by her desire to offer a home, love, protection and guidance to the infants.”  In the court documents, Judge Mwale addressed prior controversies surrounding Madonna’s adoptions in Malawi. “In determining her motives, I questioned the petitioner at length about the impact of her decision which could be construed as robbing Malawi of its most precious resource, its children,” the judge wrote.  As previously reported, Madonna filed for adoption in High Court in Malawi on January 25 but tried to keep the process under wraps until a final decision was made. (The Queen of Pop issued a statement denying her adoption to Us Weekly that same day, claiming that she was in Malawi “to check on the children’s hospital in Blantyre.”) According to the AP, she has already raised $7.5 million for a pediatric surgery ward at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, which is set to open early next year.  Madonna previously adopted son David and daughter Mercy James, both 11, from Malawi in 2008 and 2009, respectively. She is also mom to daughter Lourdes, 20, whom she shares with ex Carlos Leon, and son Rocco, 16, whom she shares with ex-husband Guy Ritchie.  Madonna’s twin girls will retain their birth names as a part of an effort to preserve their identity as Malawian nationals, the court documents said, and their father was at the January 25 court hearing with Madonna. (The twins’ mother died within a week of childbirth due to health complications.)  On Wednesday, February 8, Madonna took to social media to share the happy news. “I can officially confirm I have completed the process of adopting twin sisters from Malawi and am overjoyed that they are now part of our family,” she captioned an image of herself walking between the two little girls. “I am deeply grateful to all those in Malawi who helped make this possible, and I ask the media please to respect our privacy during this transitional time. 🙏🏻 Thank you also to my friends, family and my very large team for all your support and Love!”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!

Download the Us Weekly iPhone app now!","According to the papers, Judge Fiona Mwale challenged the pop icon on her motivations for adopting the girls, asking her if she understood the “seriousness and the responsibility” of taking on two children from a country where many face poverty and malnutrition.

Madonna, 64, appeared before Judge Mwale on January 28 in the capital city of Lilongwe, where she was granted permission to adopt the girls, named Esther and Stella. The singer already has four children, including two adopted from Malawi.

The judge’s questions highlight the scrutiny that comes with international adoptions, particularly for high-profile parents like Madonna. In 2017, she was denied the adoption of two other children from Malawi amid allegations of improper paperwork.

The new court documents show that Madonna had to convince the judge that she could provide a stable home for the twins, who were placed in her care in 2020. The singer also had to confirm that she understood the girls’ cultural heritage and was committed to preserving their connections to their birth country.

“The judge made her ask herself if she was capable of raising the children,” a source close to the case told the AP. “The judge wanted to be sure that Madonna could provide a loving and caring home for them.”

The adoption process in Malawi can be lengthy and cumbersome, and international adoptions have faced increased scrutiny in recent years. However, Madonna’s case has attracted particular attention due to her high-profile status and previous adoption attempts.

The singer has been vocal about her charity work in Malawi, where she founded the Raising Malawi foundation in 2006. The organization focuses on providing support for orphans, vulnerable children, and children with disabilities.

Madonna has not publicly commented on the adoption proceedings, and it is unclear when she will be able to bring Esther and Stella to her home in the United States."

“He’s a genius, really,” the actor said of the director. “He managed to find a way to use my state to make the character even more interesting. I think it’s going to be a very special film.”

The actor’s candid revelations come amid a growing trend in Hollywood of actors discussing their struggles with mental health and substance abuse, aiming to break the stigma and encourage others to seek help."

Ricky got me good! I was so happy that I couldn’t quit smiling. My cheeks hurt!”  The 31-year-old fertility nurse met sales manager Angel on the dating app Bumble (“Ladies pick — finally it was my choice,” jokes Bischoff) last September; the couple moved in together in May.  “On our first date, we just clicked,” she says. “It was easy and that’s the way it should be.”  Still, Bischoff admits it was “nerve-wracking” to jump back into the dating scene after her painful split from Soules in 2015, nearly seven months after they were engaged. “I was still a little bit broken and trying to pick up the pieces. But from day one there was open communication with Ricky about what I had gone through. I think one of the reasons I fell in love so quickly is that I could say everything and know I was not being judged.”  Bischoff hasn’t spoken to Soules recently but says she wishes him well. “I hope that he meets someone, if he hasn’t already, just as great for him and Ricky is for me.”  Now, Bischoff still watches The Bachelor, but says she’s moved on from her own reality show past. “That journey was a big part of my life,” she says. “But since I’ve met Ricky, I really haven’t looked back.”  Busy with wedding plans (the couple are looking at a date next fall), Bischoff says she nonetheless has positive associations with the show. “It’s sad that it ended the way it had to end, but I was still looking for that perfect someone.

Everything works out for a reason.”","""Millions of people watched her get engaged to Chris Soules on national television last year, but when former Bachelor star Whitney Bischoff and her fiancé Ricky Angel were engaged on July 15, this proposal was decidedly more intimate.

The couple, who have been dating for nearly a year, exchanged vows in an elegant, low-key ceremony in the backyard of their Chicago home. Only close friends and family members were in attendance, providing a stark contrast to the televised spectacle that marked Bischoff's previous engagement.

Angel, a successful entrepreneur, proposed to Bischoff with a stunning 3-carat diamond ring that he had designed himself. The ring features a round-cut diamond set in a platinum band, with a delicate halo of smaller diamonds surrounding the center stone.

Bischoff, who wore a simple yet elegant white dress for the occasion, could not contain her excitement as she shared the news with her social media followers. ""I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with my best friend,"" she gushed in an Instagram post that featured a photo of the happy couple sharing a kiss.

As the couple embarks on a new chapter in their lives, they are grateful for the support and well-wishes they have received from fans and friends alike. Bischoff and Angel have not yet announced a date for their wedding, but insiders say it's likely to be a small, intimate affair that reflects the couple's low-key nature and commitment to each other."""

gossipcop-6523629288,1,0,"Ever since Jennifer Aniston married Justin Theroux, pregnancy rumors have followed the couple. Something as simple as a picture of Aniston with her hand on her stomach is proof enough for some tabloids that the actress is expecting a baby. Now, a new report claims that the Friends star has hired a surrogate, could there be any truth to the story?  In the new issue of Star, the tabloid features the headline, “Jen To Justin: I’ll Raise Our Baby Alone!” followed by a story that asserts Aniston wants to become a mom, and she will do it with or without her husband. The publication claims to have a source that reveals Aniston’s marriage is “on the rocks,” and she is planning to be a single mom.  ?…❤️✌️ A post shared by @justintheroux on Aug 5, 2017 at 4:23pm PDT  “Privately, she has told friends that she’s secretly gone ahead and hired a surrogate mother to carry her child to birth. And she’s vowed to raise the baby alone,” tells the insider.  But then the source says the actress is hoping to choose the right woman soon, completely contradicting the earlier quote, which is a huge red flag that something isn’t right with this claim.  But many think the tabloid story is completely false and contradictory quotes prove the story is garbage, questioning why the insider is sharing such private and secret information with a tabloid.  This is the same magazine that published a story earlier this year claiming Aniston herself was pregnant, but then didn’t mention that at all in its latest baby claims.  Aniston told Glamour magazine back in August that not only are the pregnancy tabloid stories guilty of body shaming, but they are also an invasion into a private matter between her and her husband. She said it is no one’s business whether or not she has a baby.  Jennifer Aniston went on to say that the subject of having a baby is a sensitive topic for her, and no one has the right to judge other people’s choices.  Advertisement  What is right for her, may not be right for someone else; and, no one knows what goes on behind closed doors.","The couple has repeatedly denied the pregnancy rumors, but it seems that the tabloids are not ready to give up on this story. A source close to the couple revealed that they have been trying to have a baby for a while now, but it's been a difficult journey for them. The source also said that the constant media attention on their personal life is adding to their stress and making it even harder for them to conceive.

While it's true that Aniston is approaching the age where having a baby might be more challenging, it's important to remember that her age does not define her ability to be a mother. The couple has been together for quite some time now, and they have shown their commitment to each other in many ways. They have every right to privacy and should not have to deal with the constant scrutiny of the tabloids.

In conclusion, the pregnancy rumors surrounding Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux are unfair and invasive. The couple deserves privacy and respect, and the public should be more considerate of their feelings. It's time for the tabloids to stop speculating about Aniston's pregnancy and let the couple live their lives in peace."
gossipcop-5840642713,1,0,"Sky high prices are reportedly keeping fans from buying tickets to Taylor Swift’s upcoming Reputation tour, per a story by the New York Post. Though her 1989 world tour boasted numerous sold out performances (it eventually became the highest grossing tour of 2015), it appears her considerably more expensive snake persona is a tougher sell.  Last month, her “longtime” tour promoter told Billboard, “By the time all the tickets are sold next week, I’ll be celebrating Taylor’s birthday with a cocktail in my hand and sold-out concerts all over the world.” But her birthday has come and gone, and not one date has sold out.  Reputation was the biggest-selling album of 2017 and the tour is shaping up to be far from ill-attended, so the Post’s headline, “Taylor Swift’s Reputation tour shaping up to be a disaster,” is a little much. It does, however, highlight the problems with unpredictable pricing, scalpers, and Ticketmaster in general.  The company’s “Verified Fan” program, which they would like you to believe is all about rewarding music lovers, appears to be nothing but a cash grab that takes advantage of Swift-obsessed teens with easy access to their parents’ credit card numbers. People willing to drop $50 on merch, the Post reports, could “improve [their] position in line to purchase tickets.” And, once accessible, the tickets are often too expensive for many fans.  “I paid $150 for my ticket with amazing seats for the 1989 tour,” one fan wrote. “Now for the same seats I have to pay about $500.”  Advertisement  In related news, tickets to Katy Perry’s Friday show in New Orleans are currently starting at $23.","Fans of Taylor Swift are reportedly feeling the pinch of sky-high ticket prices for her upcoming Reputation tour, with many being priced out of the opportunity to see the pop superstar live. According to a report by the New York Post, the high costs of tickets are causing a significant drop in sales, despite the tour being one of the most anticipated events of the year.

Citing data from ticket sales tracking site Ticket Club, the New York Post story reveals that ticket sales for the Reputation tour have been slower than expected, with many shows still having tickets available weeks after going on sale. Industry insiders have pointed to the high prices of tickets, with some selling for over $600, as a major factor in the slow sales.

In a bid to boost sales, Taylor Swift’s team has been quietly offering promotions and discounts on tickets, including heavily discounted tickets for some shows. However, these efforts have not been enough to significantly boost sales, with many fans still unable to afford the high prices.

The Reputation tour is set to kick off on May 8th in Arizona, with Swift scheduled to perform 36 shows across the United States and Canada before wrapping up in Texas in October. It remains to be seen if ticket sales will pick up as the tour approaches, or if the high prices will continue to keep fans away."

(Buchanan County Sheriff via AP) Iowa farmer Chris Soules, a former star on ABC’s “The Bachelor” who charmed reality TV viewers with his small-town life, was arrested this week after police said he fled a crash that killed a fellow farmer. Soules, 35, was charged with leaving the scene of a fatal crash, a class D felony, and could face up to five years in prison if he is convicted. The case has garnered the attention of Soules’s “Bachelor” fans as well as residents of Arlington, Iowa, where he lives, who had come to appreciate the reality TV star’s work as an unofficial Iowa ambassador and farm industry advocate. “This story is going to spread like wildfire around here and probably all over because of who he is,” Mary Jo Brown, Arlington’s city clerk, told the Des Moines Register. “Sometimes fame isn’t your friend.” Soules, who also appeared in “Dancing with the Stars” and “Worst Chefs in America,” called 911 at 8:20 p.m. Monday evening to report that he had rear-ended a tractor on a rural road north of the tiny town of Aurora, about six miles away from his home. The tractor veered into a ditch after being struck by his 2008 Chevrolet Silverado, Soules said. The tractor driver — later identified as 66-year-old Kenneth Mosher, a Vietnam War veteran — was unconscious and not breathing, Soules told the 911 operator, according to audio obtained by local media. The man had a pulse, but there was blood around his mouth, Soules said. Soules identified himself on the call, which lasted nearly six minutes, and sounded frantic. Between heavy breathing, he answered the dispatcher’s questions and took instructions. Soules told the 911 operator he did not know how to perform CPR and could be heard asking unidentified people at the scene if they could perform the lifesaving measure. The call ended abruptly after the operator told Soules law enforcement and medical first responders were on the way. “Can I, can I call you back really quick?” Soules asked the dispatcher. “Yeah, you can call me back,” she says. “Thank you,” Soules responds. Soules left the crash site after emergency responders arrived, but before deputies with the Buchanan County Sheriff’s Office were on the scene, according to authorities. Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Scott Bright told the Des Moines Register that Soules fled the scene on foot and later got into a truck. In police audio obtained by local media, a deputy told a dispatcher that Soules “took off” in a red truck. Authorities are trying to identify who picked up Soules in the truck, Buchanan County Sheriff Bill Wolfgram told the Associated Press. That person could face charges, he said. Alcohol was found at the scene and investigators are trying to determine whose it was and whether it or speed were factors in the crash. Soules was arrested about five hours after the incident and booked into the Buchanan County Jail, the Associated Press reported. He posted a $10,000 bond Tuesday morning and was released on the condition that he surrender his passport and wear an electronic monitor. During his first appearance in court, the Buchanan County assistant attorney told the judge that Soules refused to cooperate with law enforcement after they located him at his home. He “would not come out,” the attorney said, until officials obtained a search warrant, which “took hours.” Chris Soules making his initial court appearance in Buchanan County @KWWL pic.twitter.com/72bvEg0wVR — Elizabeth Amanieh (@EAmaniehKWWL) April 25, 2017 Wolfgram told the Associated Press that investigators were “running into some roadblocks when it comes to getting information” but acknowledged Soules was acting within his constitutional rights. According to court documents, Soules had several run-ins with the law in his early 20s. In 2011, he was charged three times with underage alcohol possession and pleaded guilty and paid a fine for an open container violation, reported the Des Moines R","Soules, 35, was driving a pickup truck that rear-ended a tractor on Monday night in his hometown of Aurora, Iowa, sending both vehicles into ditches, authorities said. The tractor driver, 66-year-old Kenneth Mosher, was killed.

Soules was arrested hours later at his home about 10 miles away, according to a press release from the Buchanan County Sheriff’s Office. He was booked on a charge of leaving the scene of a fatal accident, a felony that carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.

Soules, who appeared on “The Bachelorette” in 2014 before starring in the 2015 season of “The Bachelor,” was released from jail on Tuesday after posting a $10,000 bond, according to the sheriff’s office.

The fatal crash has stunned Soules’ small community, where he is known as a devoted and generous member of the local farming community. His sudden notoriety in the world of reality TV has been replaced by the harsh glare of a criminal investigation that threatens to upend his life and reputation.

As the case moves forward, Soules’ attorney, Matthew F. Wilber, has said his client is devastated by the accident and is cooperating with investigators.

“He is a quiet, respectful, and responsible person, and it’s important to remember that people are innocent until proven guilty,” Wilber said in a statement. “Chris is devastated by the passing of Kenneth Mosher, and his thoughts and prayers are with the Mosher family.”"

Up till tpo that moment Crazy Jo-lie had kept Brad far from Jen. Make no mistake about it. Her frantic traveling all over the place was an attempt at keeping Pitt away from her and and any other person who might think they were a friend. She can't stand anyone but her having anything to do with Pitt . Including his own family. I knew it would backfire one day. Brad what took so long????? She suffers from an extreme mental illness. She doesn't have the kids in school for the same reason.  I do believe she thought it would last. Seeing how sexy and pretty she thinks she is. A man should and would do anything she tells them to.  I am under the impression her treatment of her surrogate Holly had a sort of wake up call to Pitt as to how utterly evil she is. You can bet she dismissed her like a piece of shite. A woman who carried twins for her. Started making Brad see her game of using and abusing.  And when Jen said her and Brad talk all the time on the phone you know that was news to little miss do as I say not as I do Angelina still talks to her ex's Jo-LIE.    Guess all the years of trying to force Brad to believe Jen was a shallow no good woman has a way of catching up to one. It took this long for Pitt to see just what had truly happened. Her spells have lost the power to confuse.In Touch said she has a terrible jealous streak and can't stand Brad even looking at a woman SHE DEEMS ATTRACTIVE IN ANY WAY. WE ALL KNOW HOW MUCH FUN THAT CAN BE.    The National Enquirer  Says Brad is so happy to have a separation from her.Brad's closest friends are woman and that drives Angelina nuts she hates sharing him  He was mad she took the salt role because she had promised him she would stay at home and be a mom.  I mean you can see her doing whatever she damn well wanted to. And he went along with it. But they have twin babies and my guess is she spends very little time bonding with them. What woman would not want to be able to stay with her new little babies. Not this woman. Sick behavior for sure. And the only thing keeping Brad from making it final is the kids.  Angie be careful what you wish for. Seems like 6 kids are going to be without a mom and dad in one place. Good luck with that",She had on a silver gown and she was looking gorgeous. I didn't want to go but she insisted that I accompany her. After the show we went to a party and that's where I met Mark Wahlberg. We started talking and he introduced me to some people. He told me he was a fan of my work and that he had seen some of my films. We exchanged numbers and I thought we would hang out sometime. The next day she told me that she had a thing with Mark Wahlberg. I was in shock because I didn't see that coming. She said she didn't want to hurt me but she couldn't resist him. I told her I didn't care and that I wanted to be there for her. She broke down and started crying. I held her in my arms and told her everything would be okay. She told me she loved me but she had to be with him. I told her it was okay and that I would always be there for her. I knew deep down inside it was over between us. I guess it was the end of an era for us.

There comes a time in every couple's relationship when the question of moving in together becomes impossible to ignore. And when those two lovebirds have been stepping out for 15 months — even though they live 3,500 miles apart; he in the UK, she in Canada — it's not so much a case of 'if' as of 'when' they will settle down. So it comes as no surprise that Prince Harry, 33, and his actress girlfriend Meghan Markle, 36, are said to be house-hunting. £7.25million - North Aston Manor, Oxfordshire: This eight bedroom property, overlooking the stunning Cherwell Valley, has seven reception rooms, a spa, swimming pool and 18.2 acres with equestrian facilities. It's nine miles from Soho Farmhouse and swanky shopping centre Bicester Village, should Meghan fancy snapping up some designer bargains Prince Harry and actress girlfriend Meghan Markle were pictured together at the Invictus Games in Toronto last month Royal sources have exclusively told the Daily Mail that the royal couple are looking in Oxfordshire and are particularly interested in high-end properties tucked away in the rolling Cotswold hills. A good friend of Harry's says the Prince, whose father's residence, Highgrove House, is in the south Cotswolds, has a long-standing affection for the area, while Meghan is said to be entranced by its rustic charm. 'He is searching for a new home in the area,' the friend reveals. 'Before Meghan, he was vaguely looking in Norfolk, but didn't find what he wanted. Now, with her input, he's renewed his search.' £2million - The Old Rectory, Lower Brailes, Oxfordshire: A stunning wood-panelled property dating from the 14th century, this boasts eight bedrooms, a sun-drenched terrace and its own private lake, complete with duck house. There’s a three-bedroom coach house for guests and it’s set at the end of a no-through road. Certainly, the lush green countryside encompassing swathes of Warwickshire, Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire is a huge draw for London-dwellers eager to snap up rural boltholes. Just an hour or so from the capital, it's home (or at least a weekend retreat) to A-listers, politicians and media executives: the Camerons, Beckhams, Kate Moss, Lily Allen and Stella McCartney all have million-pound properties in the area. 'It's like a magnet,' says Sophie Gannon, of Savills Estate Agents in Banbury, Oxfordshire. 'If you get one person, you get them all.' However, Harry isn't following the crowd but listening to his heart. The Cotswolds, and specifically Highgrove, which was bought by his father's private estate in 1980, is where the Prince spent much of his childhood. It was Charles and Diana's weekend home, with 15-acre grounds and, later on, a teenage haven in the cellars of the main house, which Harry nicknamed 'Club H'. £2.95million - Fanthill, Banbury, Oxfordshire: Accessed through electric gates, up a winding driveway, this eight-bedroom house sits among 20 acres of land, so ticks all Harry’s boxes when it comes to privacy. There’s a heated outdoor pool, miniature golf course and a carp lake, where the young lovebirds could row off the private pier A local who knows the family says: 'It's not surprising that Harry would like to live where he feels at home. 'He's lived in the Cotswolds all his life and often returns to visit his father. After his mother died, it became a place of sanctuary. 'When the boys entered their teens, Charles bought several homes in the area, thinking they might want one in the future.' Ten years ago, Charles bought up properties adjacent to his sprawling estate, paying £2 million apiece for nearby manor houses and farm buildings. But sources say rather than living off his father's generosity, Harry wants to invest in a place of his own. £4.25million - Cross Hill House, Adderbury, Oxfordshire: This 10-bedroom house, surrounded by landscaped","The Cotswolds, an area of outstanding natural beauty in the heart of England, is fast becoming the royal retreat of choice for Prince William and Kate Middleton.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have reportedly been house hunting in the region, as they look to swap their dusty old Norfolk estate for something a little more groovy. And local estate agents are said to be rubbing their hands together in anticipation of the lucrative deal.

A source close to the couple revealed that they have their hearts set on a property in the Cotswolds, with its picturesque villages, rolling hills, and quintessential English charm. The insider added that the lovebirds are keen to immerse themselves in the vibrant local community and embrace the relaxed, bohemian vibe that the area is famous for.

As news of the royal interest in the Cotswolds spreads, property prices in the region are expected to soar. Local estate agents are already preparing for a rush of interest from buyers eager to snap up a piece of real estate fit for a king and queen.

One estate agent, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confided that they have already been approached by a top-secret client, believed to be the Duke and Duchess' representatives, who are searching for the perfect property to suit the couple's needs.

With the eyes of the world on the Cotswolds, the pressure is on for the royal couple to find their dream home. But with so many stunning properties to choose from, they're sure to find something that fits the bill. And with the local community ready to welcome them with open arms, it seems the Cotswolds is set to become the royal family's go-to retreat for years to come."
gossipcop-2365987922,1,1,"Jenny and her silk pillowcases.  It’s no secret that Jennifer Lopez-at 48-has a body that won’t quit and skin that needs to be studied so we can all age like the goddess she is.  Dramatic? Not even close.  And while a lot of it may be down to great genes, Lopez has revealed in a new interview some of her beauty secrets and yep, they’re as diva as you might expect.  Lopez credits her glow to positive affirmations, revealing she says one in particular to herself every day to keep her radiant, youthful look intact.  So what is this magic phrase?  “I am youthful and timeless at every age,” Lopez says every single day—but it’s not enough to just say the mantra daily, because Lopez also has a handful of pillows with these words and more mantras embroidered into them all over her home. “I tell myself that every day, a few times a day. It sounds like clichéd bullshit, but it’s not: Age is all in your mind. Look at Jane Fonda.”  Lopez continues, “The affirmations are everywhere. I forget that they’re all here. They’re just part of the house now.”  Before you scoff at Lopez’s positivity there is a school of thought that believes negative thoughts can age you. Australian-born Dr Blackburn, a Nobel Prize winner, co-authored The Telomere Effect: A Revolutionary Approach to Living Younger, Healthier, Longer, with anti-aging psychologist Dr Elissa Epel, which investigated the link between telomeres, which protect our chromosomes, and the effect stress, sleep and diet can have on telomeres and how that directly corresponds with our health.  The book asserts there is a correlation between depression and anxiety and shorter telomeres and that “when pessimists develop an aging-related illness, like cancer or heart disease, the illness tends to progress faster.”  And really there's only so far a little highlight can go, step one is all about a positive attitude. Step two is to find yourself a great pillowcase and settle on your new mantra.  So what’s the lesson here? Your inner glow is only a glass half full attitude away.",But what many don’t know is that the key to her fountain of youth is a simple swap: silk pillowcases over traditional cotton ones.
gossipcop-4678149709,1,0,"Since separating from Channing Tatum in April, Jenna Dewan has put a cheery spin on the end of their nine-year marriage. “I feel I’ve been on a wave of growth,” Jenna said recently. “It’s OK for a relationship to change into a new form that is actually better for both people involved, and I think that’s maybe what shocked everyone so much — that it can be a positive thing.”  But it's apparently not so positive anymore. Each time Channing and Jenna head to mediation to discuss the terms of their divorce, “they can’t seem to agree on anything,” says a source. “Their meetings have been contentious.” One big issue: their five-year-old daughter, Everly. “They can’t agree on custody,” a friend tells In Touch exclusively.      Unicorns do exist. A post shared by Channing Tatum (@channingtatum) on May 4, 2018 at 6:40pm PDT      “They’re both working hard to do what’s in the best interest of their daughter, but it’s just taking way longer than they both expected because they can’t agree on the small details.” Another sticking point: Channing’s estimated $60 million fortune. Though Jenna, 37, has had a successful movie and TV career with shows like Supergirl, Channing, 38, has starred in several blockbusters, such as Magic Mike and 21 Jump Street, and was the family’s main breadwinner. “Jenna has told friends that she gave Channing the best years of her life,” says the source, “and now she’s trying to negotiate a very secure future for herself.”  There is a lot at stake financially. During the course of their marriage, the pair acquired several assets, including a $6 million Beverly Hills home and pricey cars including a Tesla and a vintage Chevrolet truck. Finding common ground about dividing their stuff “is not easy,” says the friend. “They both want it to be over with.”          Jenna never thought it would come to this. “She isn’t pleased about how it’s all played out so far,” says the source. “She’s bitter. There are days when she’s blaming him for not working harder to save their marriage.” And while she’s told pals that she hopes they can stay friends, adds the source, deep down “she knows that’s never going to happen.”  Channing shouldn’t underestimate Jenna, says the source: “She’s looking out for herself, and at the end of the day she knows that he’s got to pay. She’s not going to walk away quietly.”  For more on this, pick up the latest issue of In Touch — and for more exclusive content sign up for our newsletter.

gossipcop-1550362715,1,0,"In the immortal words of Hilary Duff, “Let’s go back, back to the beginning.” January 2016 played host to a series of Kardashian-Jenner-West-Rose-Chyna feuds that have been years in the making. From “cool pants” to clover emojis, there’s a lot of backstory that needs explaining in order to completely understand everything that went down among Kanye West and Wiz Khalifa and Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna. To keep you informed, Us Weekly has broken it down with a comprehensive timeline of events. Kanye West Dates Amber Rose In 2008, the Grammy-winning rapper started a relationship with unknown model Rose after spotting her in Ludacris’ “What Them Girls Like” music video. The pair had a public two-year romance. Amber Rose Breaks Up With Kanye West In mid-2010, Rose called things off with West. A year after the split, Rose appeared on The Wendy Williams Show, noting, “[Kanye] said that he was an a-hole and he was mean to me and he didn’t treat me the way he was supposed to. I accepted his apology because I feel like he’s remorseful for how he treated me.” Blac Chyna and Tyga Have a Son, Get Engaged Meanwhile, an up-and-coming rapper named Tyga welcomed a baby boy named King Cairo Stevenson with his then-girlfriend, model Blac Chyna, in October 2012. “Most amazing feeling ever. #Blessed #2Kings,” Tyga captioned a Twitter photo cradling his little boy. That December, the couple confirmed they were engaged in an Instagram post featuring Chyna’s giant diamond ring. Kanye West Starts Dating Kim Kardashian Fresh off his split from Rose, West set his sights on his longtime friend and crush Kim Kardashian in early 2012. The pair were spotted out together and Kardashian’s famous family even started pressing the reality star for details on her new romance (remember when he let her borrow his car?!). Kanye West Raps About Wiz Khalifa, Amber Rose As West’s romance with Kardashian blossomed, so did that of his ex Rose and her new rapper fiancé, Wiz Khalifa. In April 2012, West released the song “Cold” in which he rapped, “Only n—a I got respect for is Wiz / And I’ll admit, I had fell in love with Kim around the same time she had fell in love with him.” Amber Rose Marries Wiz Khalifa After Welcoming Son Sebastian In February 2013, Rose and Khalifa had their first child, son Sebastian, announcing the news on Twitter. In July 2013, the couple secretly wed; the next month, they had a big ceremony in which Rose wore a stunning Pnina Tornai for Kleinfeld gown. She didn’t share photos from the private event until their one-year anniversary. North West Is Born Following a difficult pregnancy, Kim gave birth to her daughter, North West, in June 2013. West penned the song “Only One” for his little girl.

As new mom Kim worked hard to get back to her pre-baby weight in time for her wedding to West, she posted selfies in workout clothes with Chyna by her side. Kanye West Marries Kim Kardashian After gracing the cover of Vogue in wedding couture, the A-list couple tied the knot in an elaborate European wedding weekend that began in Paris and ended with an Italian ceremony in May 2014. Rob Kardashian Skips the Wedding, Remains Under the Radar Things got awkward when Kim’s younger brother, Rob Kardashian, left Kim’s wedding festivities early. His exit followed months of erratic behavior: avoiding appearances on the family’s reality series, Keeping Up With the Kardashians, significant weight gain and depression. He’s stayed out of the public eye ever since. “He sent me a long email the morning of [saying] that he was going to leave,” Kim later said on Watch What Happens Live. “There was no fight.” Blac Chyna and Tyga Split In August 2014, the parents called it quits. “They are trying to keep it amicable,” ","From the cryptic tweets and deleted Instagrams to the whispers and shouts, it seems like the world is still trying to unravel the mystery that is the Kardashian-Jenner family dynamic.

So let’s take a step back and revisit the original feud that set the stage for the rest of the year: Kanye West vs. Taylor Swift. In 2009, Kanye interrupted Taylor’s acceptance speech at the MTV Video Music Awards, declaring that Beyoncé deserved the award more. Since then, the two have had an on-again, off-again feud that has played out in the public eye.

Fast-forward to February 2016. Kanye releases his new album, The Life of Pablo, and includes a track called “Famous,” which contains the lyric, “I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / I made that b**** famous.” Taylor responds with a statement on Instagram, saying she was never aware of the specific lyric and that Kanye never called her to discuss it.

The fallout continues as Kim Kardashian posts a series of Snapchat videos that appear to show Kanye discussing the lyric with Taylor over the phone. The videos spark a social media frenzy, with fans and celebrities alike taking sides in the feud.

In the end, it’s not about who’s right or wrong, but rather the intricate web of relationships and alliances that have formed as a result of this ongoing saga. As we move forward into 2023, it’s worth taking a moment to reflect on the lessons learned from the past and how they can shape our future. In the immortal words of Hilary Duff, “Let’s go back, back to the beginning.”"

The insider revealed, ""Things between Cheryl and Liam are strained at the moment. Cheryl feels like she's having to do everything on her own and it's really wearing her down. Liam's been spending more and more time away from home, working on new music and other projects, while Cheryl stays at home with Bear.""

(Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) Ivanka Trump’s products weren’t always the hottest items online. In January, for instance, the first daughter’s fashion line ranked No. 550 based on the number of orders from Lyst, the biggest fashion e-commerce website in the world, according to Forbes. That changed dramatically the following month. Sales of Trump’s products skyrocketed in early February, making her Lyst’s 11th most popular brand. The biggest spike, according to Lyst, came on Feb. 9, when sales jumped by 219 percent from the day before. Yes, Feb. 9 — the same day that White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted Trump’s clothing and jewelry line on “Fox & Friends.” “Go buy Ivanka’s stuff is what I would tell you,” Conway said. “I’m going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody.” And viewers did, apparently. Sales of Ivanka Trump’s branded products skyrocketed on Feb. 9, the same day White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted the line on Fox News. (Lyst) Abigail Klem, president of the Ivanka Trump brand, said in a statement that “the beginning of February” shows “the best performing weeks in the history of the brand.” “For several different retailers, Ivanka Trump was a top performer online, and in some of the categories it was the best performance ever,” Klem said. Sarah Tanner, Lyst’s spokeswoman, said increases in sales are usually tied to current events. For instance, interest in pantsuits went up by 460 percent last year because of Hillary Clinton’s affinity for the style, she said. Sales of the first daughter’s products went up by 86 percent in November when her father won the presidential election, according to the company. Conway has come under fire for touting Ivanka Trump's clothing line during a televised interview. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) [A Trump wine boycott backfires spectacularly] But the brand was “largely featured” in the news in February, Tanner said. Conway gave her on-air endorsement of Ivanka Trump’s brand after President Trump had complained on Twitter that his daughter had “been treated so unfairly” by the department store Nordstrom, which dropped her clothing line over slow sales. “It would not be a surprise to us if it resulted in the increase in sales,” Tanner said of Conway’s Fox interview. “I think that’s one of the reasons the brand was largely in the news and could have attributed to this increase.” Conway did not respond to an email requesting comment. Her promotion of the fashion line appeared to violate an ethics rule barring federal employees from using their public office to endorse products and immediately drew criticism from both Democrats and Republicans. [Where does the Ivanka Trump brand go from here?] Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said Conway’s comments were “absolutely wrong, wrong, wrong” and “clearly over the line,” The Washington Post reported. The White House later said that Conway had been “counseled.” But concerns about her comments remain. On Thursday, the government’s top ethics official criticized the White House for not disciplining Conway, The Post’s Drew Harwell reported. Walter M. Shaub Jr., director of the Office of Government Ethics, had urged officials last month to reprimand the White House counsel but was rebuffed. On Thursday he wrote to Stefan C. Passantino, who handles White House ethics issues as the president’s deputy counsel. “When an employee’s conduct violates, disciplinary action serves to deter future misconduct,” Shaub wrote. “Not taking disciplinary action against a senior official under such circumstances risks undermining the ethics program.” [A Trump voter’s message to retailers: ‘Keep your mouths shut about our president’] Last month, a group of law professors filed a professional misconduct complaint against Conway — a","Ivanka Trump, the eldest daughter of President Donald Trump, has quietly emerged as one of the most influential first children in American history. Although she does not hold an official position within the Trump administration, her influence on policy decisions and diplomatic engagements has become increasingly evident.

From advocating for paid family leave to playing a key role in the American labor force, Ivanka has made it her mission to promote policies that benefit working families. She has also been instrumental in shaping the administration's approach to global women's issues, spearheading the Women's Global Development and Prosperity Initiative, which seeks to economically empower women worldwide.

Ivanka's unique position as both a family member and a close adviser to the president has granted her unprecedented access to the corridors of power. Her presence on high-level diplomatic missions, such as the 2020 G7 Summit in Canada, has raised eyebrows and sparked debate about the appropriate role of first children in the political sphere.

As Ivanka Trump continues to wield considerable influence behind the scenes, questions remain about the transparency and accountability of her actions. While some argue that her informal role allows her to navigate the political landscape more effectively, others contend that the lack of oversight and public scrutiny may undermine democratic norms and contribute to a blurring of lines between family, business, and public service."

The rider also reportedly requests that the room be kept at a temperature between 68 and 72 degrees Fahrenheit, and that it not be directly adjacent to any other dressing rooms.

The full extent of her diva behavior, however, becomes apparent when one learns that she requires a ""thoroughly cleaned"" toilet seat cover to be placed on every toilet seat in her dressing room, along with a new toilet roll for each of the facilities.

As the International Business Times reports, “The actor was mistakenly linked to an Australian journalist and then was associated to his Mission: Impossible 6 co-star and Crown actress Vanessa Kirby.”  All rumors until now have been stamped out as false.  However, the latest claims include those stating that members of the Church of Scientology have once again been playing matchmaker for the Top Gun star and that Cruise has reportedly been secretly dating over the past little while.

A source told the publication about Cruise’s tactics to keep his love life out of the spotlight.  “Tom’s back on the dating scene, but nobody knows it’s him. His face is way too recognizable for him to stroll into the bars, so he has his makeup artist create a silicone mask. Seems like Tom took his Mission: Impossible role to heart.

gossipcop-2161541420,1,1,"Kate Hudson Net Worth: Kate Hudson is an American actress who has a net worth of $38 million dollars. Born Kate Garry Hudson on April 19, 1979, in Los Angeles, California, US, she came to prominence in 2001 with her incredible turn in Almost Famous. This role not only made her famous, but it also fetched her a Golden Globe and several nominations, including a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Being a daughter of American actress Goldie Hawn, Hudson bears more than a passing resemblance to her famous mother in both looks and onscreen vivacity. She got the chance to showcase her talent in 1996, when she made her TV debut on Fox's TV series Party of Five (1994-2000). Although she only appeared in one episode titled ""Spring Breaks: Part 1"", this initial experience was enough to uphold her determination to develop a professional acting career in Hollywood. However, it was in 1999 that she started to attract public attention when critics lauded her brilliant portrayal of Cindy in ""200 Cigarettes"", even though the movie itself was a commercial disappointment. Onwards, her career experienced a significant advancement, especially after she managed to obtain a supporting role in ""Gossip"" and ""Dr T and the Women"" which both came up in 2000. While her accolade-worthy performance in Cameron Crowe's Almost Famous indicated that she was set to follow her mother in taking the film industry by storm. In the midst of a whirlwind schedule of fashion shoots and awards shows, she made an appearance in the romantic war drama The Four Feathers in 2002. Turning out to be a box-office failure, Hudson fired back with the surefire hit as she starred opposite quirky heartthrob Matthew McConaughey in the romantic comedy How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003). She continued to establish herself as a fully-fledged actress starring in subsequent productions like Raising Helen (2004), The Skeleton Key (2005), You, Me and Dupree (2006), Fool's Gold (2008) and Bride Wars (2009). As of most recent, she could be seen in the musical comedy-drama television series Glee as Cassandra July.","Since then, she has gone on to appear in a variety of films, such as How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, Fool's Gold, Bride Wars, and Deepwater Horizon. In addition to her acting career, Hudson has also ventured into business, co-founding the athletic wear company Fabletics in 2013. The company has since become a massive success, contributing significantly to her wealth.

In her personal life, Hudson has been linked to several high-profile relationships, including those with actors Chris Robinson and Owen Wilson. She has also been married to musician Chris Robinson and hockey player Derek Anderson. She has two sons, one from each marriage.

Kate Hudson's net worth is an impressive testament to her hard work and dedication in both her acting and entrepreneurial pursuits. As she continues to grow both her career and her business empire, it's likely that her wealth will continue to rise in the coming years."

""Been taking the high road for a long time.. I almost gave up. But I can finally see something on the horizon up there!! Wait!! Could it be?! Yep!! It’s karma!!"" Shelton tweeted after multiple outlets reported Lambert began dating married Turnpike Troubadours front man, Evan Felker.  But according to Lambert's ex-boyfriend Jeff Allen, Shelton is not as innocent as he's trying to seem.  Allen tweeted and deleted a post calling out Shelton for romancing Allen's then-girlfriend Lambert while Shelton was still married to his first wife, Kaynette Williams, in 2006.  ""You know, I’ve always given you the benefit of the doubt and chalked it up to just being human, but you must be one arrogant SOB to pop off something like this, when I know damn good and well you were cheating on your wife and Miranda was cheating on me when you two started up,"" Allen wrote in a since-deleted tweet, according to Us Weekly.  ""I kept my mouth shut for 13 years. Sorry, his karma tweet rubbed me wrong. All of this is pointless,"" he added.  Allen told RadarOnline.com, ""I’m sure Miranda did [Blake] dirty just like she did me, but he wasn’t thinking about me when he was cheating with her, so I don’t know why he thinks it's karma.""  He added that he does not harbor bad feelings toward Lambert and said she ""was a loving, caring person and a good girlfriend.""  Reps for Lambert and Shelton did not return Fox News' requests for comment.  It's been reported that Lambert and Shelton's romance began as an affair but both singers have denied this in the past. They became engaged in May 2010 and married a year later in Texas. The country singers announced their divorce after four years of marriage in July 2015.  The ""Tin Man"" singer, who recently ended things with her boyfriend of two years, Anderson East, reportedly began seeing Felker when his band joined Lambert's ""Livin’ Like Hippies"" tour in January.  Felker married global strategist Staci Nelson in September 2016. The singer filed for divorce on Feb. 16 while Nelson filed 12 days later.  Nelson, who still goes by her married name on social media, shared a tearful selfie on Thursday with the caption, ""PSA: If Staci Felker can make it through this week, so can you.""","The irony of the situation was not lost on fans, who took to social media to criticize the singer for his apparent hypocrisy.

Blake Shelton, a popular country music singer, found himself at the center of controversy last week after sending a cryptic tweet about ""karma."" The tweet came at a time when reports surfaced that his ex-wife, Miranda Lambert, was allegedly dating a married man.

Fans quickly pointed out the irony of the situation, taking to social media to criticize Shelton for what they perceived as hypocrisy. Many noted that Shelton's tweet seemed to be a thinly veiled reference to his own personal life, particularly his high-profile divorce from Lambert in 2015.

Shelton and Lambert were once considered one of the most influential couples in country music, but their split sent shockwaves through the industry. Since then, both artists have moved on with their lives and careers, but the memory of their tumultuous relationship still lingers in the minds of their fans.

The controversy surrounding Shelton's tweet has sparked a larger conversation about the role of social media in celebrity relationships and the double standards that often exist in the public's perception of male and female behavior. Some argue that Shelton's tweet is an example of the way men often seek to control the narrative surrounding their personal lives, while others believe that the singer is simply expressing his frustration with the situation.

As the debate continues, Shelton has yet to comment further on the matter, and it remains unclear whether his tweet was indeed a reference to Lambert's new relationship. Regardless, the incident has once again placed the spotlight on the complex dynamics of celebrity relationships and the scrutiny that often accompanies them."

Apparently, Gwen was jealous over his closeness with The Voice winner Chloe Kohanski, and Blake got sick of trying to make her trust him. “She told him she didn’t want to spend her life in fear of her famous partner cheating on her.""  “Blake told Gwen that he was going to be doing the latter part of the monthlong Country Freaks Tour without her,” said the source. “Gwen was so used to accompanying him on tour, she was upended. After their nastiest argument ever, Blake took off without even saying goodbye. It was a real breaking point in the relationship.” Watch the video below to look back at the couple in happier times.  Even worse, Blake has been looking for solace with newly-single ex-wife Miranda Lambert! “Miranda reached out to Blake via text,” said the insider. “Ultimately, they buried the hatchet and have been supporting each other through their latest troubled relationships. They’ve become close friends and allies over the past month or so. They have developed into close confidantes and are sharing intimate details of their lives.” We can only imagine how Gwen would feel about that.

Tom Hiddleston and Idris Elba Spotted at Anna Wintour's Dinner

**Leading Paragraph:**
A candid photo of British actors Tom Hiddleston and Idris Elba leaving a dinner at Anna Wintour's residence in New York City has surfaced online, sparking speculation about the nature of their relationship. The image, captured on the evening of 1 May, 2016, shows the two stars leaving the venue together, laughing and engaging in what appears to be a lively conversation.

**Supporting Paragraphs:**
The unexpected encounter of the two A-list celebrities at the renowned editor's home has generated considerable interest among fans and the media alike. Although both Hiddleston and Elba have enjoyed successful careers in Hollywood, their paths had never before been known to cross in such a manner.

The photo offers a rare glimpse into the private lives of the two actors, who are seen dressed casually, a departure from their typically polished red-carpet appearances. This informality has led some to believe that the dinner may have been a social gathering, rather than a professional or promotional event.

**Final Paragraph:**
While the purpose of the meeting between Hiddleston and Elba remains undisclosed, the photograph serves as a testament to the camaraderie and mutual respect shared by the two British stars. As their careers continue to thrive, it is likely that future collaborations or projects involving both actors will be met with eager anticipation by their fans and the entertainment industry alike."
gossipcop-7885025406,1,0,"More than a month has passed since Matt Lauer was fired from the Today show, and his former longtime colleague, Katie Couric, is now opening up about the former NBC anchor’s shocking dismissal.  “The whole thing has been very painful for me,” Couric, 61, tells PEOPLE. “The accounts I’ve read and heard have been disturbing, distressing and disorienting and it’s completely unacceptable that any woman at the Today show experienced this kind of treatment.  “I had no idea this was going on during my tenure or after I left,” she continued. “I think I speak for many of my former colleagues when I say this was not the Matt we knew. Matt was a kind and generous colleague who treated me with respect. In fact, a joke I once made on late-night television was just that, because it was completely contrary to our brother-sister relationship. It’s still very upsetting. I really admire the way Savannah [Guthrie] and Hoda [Kotb] and the entire Today show staff have handled a very difficult situation.”  The late-night show joke that Couric refers to is when she said on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen in 2012 that Lauer “pinches me on the ass a lot.” A clip of the comment made the rounds online in the wake of Lauer’s firing.  Couric spent 15 years co-hosting NBC’s Today show with Lauer, 60, but left in May 2006 to anchor the CBS Evening News.  NBC/Getty  Lauer was fired at the end of November by NBC News after the network received a “detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior,” with reason to believe “this may not have been an isolated incident.” Women have also anonymously accused him of sexual harassment and assault in reports published by Variety and The New York Times.  Following his firing, which was announced live on Today by Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb, Lauer addressed the original allegations in a statement.  “There are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions,” he said, in part. “To the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry. As I am writing this, I realize the depth of the damage and disappointment I have left behind at home and at NBC.”  Although her PEOPLE interview is the first time Couric has spoken in detail about Lauer’s exit, she briefly broke her silence about the scandal on social media in December.  In a short response to an Instagram user, who called Couric out for not publicly addressing the scandal, the veteran journalist said, “It’s incredibly upsetting and I will say something when I’m ready to. Thanks for your interest.”  RELATED VIDEO: Women of Hollywood Attend Golden Globes Together in Support of the Time’s Up Movement  The claims against Lauer came as hundreds of women and men — including Rose McGowan, Ashley Judd, Terry Crews and Anthony Rapp — have publicly came forward about alleged sexual misconduct at the hands of powerful men in Hollywood, including Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey.  The movement inspired the new Time’s Up initiative and legal defense fund that was created to help victims of sexual misconduct pursue legal action against their perpetrators. Time’s Up was a major focus at this year’s Golden Globes, where almost all the famous attendees wore black to raise awareness about the cause.  “I think it was really moving to see so many women support each other and demand change, not only for themselves, but for mistreated and marginalized women in all kinds of industries,” Couric tells PEOPLE about Time’s Up. “Clearly we are witnessing a sea change and a long overdue course correction.”  She also said that one of the new of the episodes of her upcoming six-part documentary Nat Geo series will focus on harassment women have experienced in their workplaces.  “One of my Nat Geo episodes explores the various obstacles that are holding women back in Hollywood, Silicon Valley and beyond,” she says. “I just interviewed Elisabeth Moss about this. Harassment is just one part of the equation.”  RELATED VIDEO: Hoda Kotb and ","In a recent interview with People magazine, Couric, who co-hosted the Today show with Lauer from 1997 to 2006, revealed that she was “shocked and saddened” by the news of his termination.

“I had no idea this was going on,” Couric told the magazine. “I’m still grappling with the news. It’s really hard to process. Matt was a dear, dear friend, and I will miss him. But I also understand that NBC had to make a decision, and I support their decision.”

Couric also spoke about the broader issue of sexual harassment in the workplace, calling it a “watershed moment” for society.

“I think it’s incredibly important that women are coming forward and being believed, and that companies are taking this seriously,” she said. “I think it’s a watershed moment, and I think it’s going to lead to long-lasting change.”

The former Today show host added that she hopes the movement will lead to a safer and more respectful work environment for everyone.

“I hope this is a moment of real transformation, and that women who have experienced these kinds of violations feel empowered to come forward,” Couric said. “I also hope that men who are in positions of power will think long and hard about their behavior and how they can create a safer and more respectful work environment for everyone.”

Katie Couric’s candid interview offers a glimpse into the shock and sadness that many are feeling in the wake of Matt Lauer’s firing. As the #MeToo movement continues to gain momentum, her thoughts on the matter underscore the importance of addressing sexual misconduct and creating a culture of respect and accountability in the workplace."

""It's your 60th birthday and this gift had to be really special and it had to represent who you are and what you really care about,"" Portia explains. ""Not just now, but what you've always cared about. What you were influenced by and what has made you the amazing person that you are today. So, I combined that and questions when we first met like, 'Who's your idol? And what would you do if you weren't a talk show host?'"" She continues, ""So, I combined that with the fact that literally guys, for, like, the last two years, Ellen has said to me, 'I feel like I'm not doing enough.' Every day, almost. So, I put all that together and I got you this gift. So, let's see it -- happy birthday!"" Portia then cuts to a video of her talking about Ellen's hero, Dian Fossey, and her dedication to animals. ""So, for your birthday, Ellen, I am bringing you and your hero, Dian, together by building the Ellen DeGeneres Campus of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund,"" she reveals. ""Ellen, you will carry on Dian's legacy by giving them a permanent home in Rwanda. Now, you will join Dian as a protector and champion of these amazing animals, the mountain gorillas. Happy birthday!"" Portia didn't stop there! ""I have also set up a foundation in your name called The Ellen DeGeneres Wildlife Fund,"" she shares. ""So, this is the first initiative for the fund that you can take this and do whatever you want with it. You've done amazing work for elephants and you can just continue and support whatever you want to do."" Blown over by the gift, Ellen says tearfully, ""It’s the best gift. I’ve always said -- and when we got married, Portia’s line was, 'It’s good to be loved; it’s profound to be understood' -- and, she understands me because that is the best gift that anybody could have given me. So, I love you.""

The No Doubt singer took to Instagram to share a picture of her country singer beau kissing her cheek.  The loved-up snap is a clear message that their relationship is still on - after claims she was dumped over ""jealousy and drama"" to do with her ex-husband Gavin Rossdale.  ""Blake’s through with Gwen’s neediness and all the drama: her demanding, critical ex-husband and her jealousy of him and other women,"" a source told In Touch Weekly .  “She told him she didn’t want to spend her life in fear of her famous partner cheating on her.""

""Gwen was so used to accompanying him on tour, she was upended. After their nastiest argument ever, Blake took off without even saying goodbye. It was a real breaking point in the relationship.""  Mirror Online has contacted Gwen's representative for comment.  Last year, her ex-husband Gavin revealed that he and Gwen went through ""so much counselling"" in a bid to save their marriage.  The 51-year-old former Voice coach split up from the No Doubt singer in 2013 after 13 years of marriage. The couple finalised their divorce in April 2016.  Appearing on Loose Women , Gavin said that they had tried desperately hard to save their marriage.  Gavin said: ""We had so much counselling, so much counselling, I could be a counsellor.  “I tried, I tried hard but that’s the way it goes.  (Image: REX/Shutterstock)  (Image: Getty Images)  “But when you look at it, in a weird way, there are no accidents. “Life works out how it should and I made sure I did everything I could so that if I was sat here two years on, I know I tried everything I could as opposed to being steadfast or arrogant or assuming I didn’t need help or we didn’t need help.  “I kind of embraced the help.”  The couple have three sons with Gwen - Kingston, 11, Zuma, nine and Apollo, three.  (Image: NIJO)  Gavin is now dating German model Sophia Thomalla, 27, while Gwen is dating Blake Shelton, 41.  When asked whether he had told his children about his girlfriend, he said that they hadn't.  He revealed: ""Not yet no. [We’ve had] a bit of FaceTime to ease it in you know.”","The No Doubt singer, 51, and her country crooner beau, 50, have been dating on and off since 2015, and have faced numerous split rumours over the years.

But Gwen has now slammed claims she's been ""dumped"" by Blake, telling her followers on Twitter: ""I'm not dumped.""

She added: ""That's not what happened. We're together. We're still here.""

The couple sparked speculation they had parted ways after Gwen was spotted without her engagement ring during a recent outing in Los Angeles.

But the singer, who shares three sons with ex-husband Gavin Rossdale, insisted she simply hadn't been wearing the jewellery.

She tweeted: ""I don't even know where my ring is. I'm not wearing it. I don't know where it is. It's not like I'm like, 'Oh my god, I lost my ring!'""

Gwen also addressed reports she's been ""pining"" for Blake, telling her fans: ""I'm not pining for someone.""

The pair have been busy with their respective careers in recent months, with Blake currently a coach on The Voice and Gwen working on new music.

But they have been making time for each other, with Gwen recently joining Blake at his Oklahoma ranch.

A source told People magazine: ""Gwen and Blake are still very much together and are not breaking up. They have had a great summer together and are still very much in love.""

The insider added: ""They both have demanding careers but are very committed to each other and their relationship.""

Despite the latest rumours, it seems the couple are still going strong and are focused on making their long-distance relationship work."

But the male player ranked 701 in the world - Dmitry Tursunov - believes he could beat her.  Speaking to US radio station NPR, seven-time Grand Slam champion McEnroe said of former world number one Williams, who has won an Open-era record 23 Grand Slams: ""If she played the men's circuit she'd be, like, 700 in the world.""  He qualified the comments by saying: ""That doesn't mean I don't think Serena is an incredible player, and I suppose anything's possible; maybe at some point a women's tennis player can be better than anybody.""  But he added: ""I just haven't seen that in any other sport, and I haven't seen it in tennis. If she had to just play the men's circuit, it would be an entirely different story.""  Williams later responded on Twitter: ""Dear John, I adore and respect you but please please keep me out of your statements that are not factually based.  ""I've never played anyone ranked ""there"" nor do I have time. Respect me and my privacy as I'm trying to have a baby. Good day sir.""  Williams, 35, won her 23rd Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in January. It later transpired she was pregnant at the time  'She is pregnant, and I'm not'  Tursunov, 34, was once ranked as high as 20th in the world.  The Russian told BBC World Service Sport he did not think McEnroe was ""trying to talk women's tennis down"" but said ""the reality"" was that ""men are stronger in general"".  ""I would hope that I would win against Serena,"" he added.  ""It would be a similar argument to: who would run faster, the fastest woman or the fastest man? Tennis is becoming more and more a physical sport, so it's going to be hard for a woman to beat the men.  ""It's not black and white, there are lots of factors to take into account. Physically I might not be in the best shape of my life but as an overall package I'm much better than my ranking would suggest. She is pregnant, and I'm not.  ""I've never heard John say anything absolutely stupid - he knows his stuff. What he said about her being an incredible player is correct - explosive, powerful and she puts in a lot of work. But I would hope that I would win.""  Battle of the sexes  A crowd of 30,000 watched Billie Jean King take on Bobby Riggs in Houston in 1973  Tennis matches between men and women have occurred before, mostly notably back in 1973 when Billie Jean King took on fellow American Bobby Riggs.  Riggs, the world number one in the 1940s, retired in 1951 and at the age of 55 believed he could beat any of the top female players.  King originally declined to play Riggs and Australian Margaret Court - at the time the top female player in the world - stepped in. Riggs won 6-2 6-1.  But later that year, the top ranked women's player King - 26 years younger than Riggs at 29 - took him on in an exhibition match at the Houston Astrodome and won 6-4 6-3 6-3.  A third 'Battle of the Sexes' match took in 1992 between American former world number one Jimmy Connors, aged 40 at the time, and Czech and American Martina Navratilova, who was 35.  The match took place under special rules to make it more competitive - Connors was allowed only one serve per point, and Navratilova was allowed to hit into half the doubles court. Connors won 7-5 6-2.","The 23-time Grand Slam champion has hit back at the former world No.1 after he said she would be ""like 700 in the world"" if she played on the men's tour.

Williams, 37, who is currently competing at Wimbledon, told BBC Sport: ""I'm not really sure what he's talking about. I mean, I'm literally just focused on my match right now.

""I have a lot to do to get ready for my match, but I think that if he's saying that, it's really not something that I'm too concerned about at all.""

McEnroe's comments, made during an interview with NPR to promote his new book, But Seriously, have sparked a backlash on social media.

The American, who has won seven Grand Slam titles, was asked about his previous remarks that Williams would be ranked around 700 if she played on the men's tour.

He replied: ""Best female player ever, no question. If she had to just play the men's circuit, it would be an entirely different story.""

Williams's coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, said McEnroe's comments were ""unfair"" and ""inappropriate"".

He told BBC Sport: ""John McEnroe is a legend of the game and I have a lot of respect for him, but I think he's wrong and I think it's a bit unfair to say something like that about Serena.

""I think he should be more respectful. Serena is a great champion, she has done so much for the game, and she's still playing at a high level.""

Williams, who is seeded 10th at Wimbledon, faces Russian qualifier Evgeniya Rodina in the fourth round on Centre Court later."
gossipcop-4541624536,1,0,"Two arrests have been made in the murders of four women at Fairmont Terrace Apartments last month, police announced Wednesday afternoon.  Brothers, James Stanford Poore, 32, and Cedric Dwayne Poore, 39, were arrested and booked on four complaints each of first degree murder, Chief Chuck Jordan said.  On Monday, January 7, 2013, twin sisters Rebeika Powell and Kayetie Powell-Melchor, 23; Misty Nunley, 33, and Julie Jackson, 55 were found shot in the head, with their hands tied behind their backs inside a south Tulsa apartment, police say. A 3-year-old boy was also found inside the apartment, unharmed.  Chief Jordan said the murders were not gang-related. According to arrest reports, witnesses told investigators that the brothers left an apartment in the same building at Fairmont Terrace Apartments, near 61st and Peoria, saying they were going to pull a ""lick"" at the victims' apartment.  Witnesses told police the brothers returned about 20 minutes later with a bag full of drugs, cash, and jewelry. According to the report, James Poore told the witnesses that he shot one of the victims because she could identify him and that Cedric shot the other three. The witnesses told investigators the brothers split the money and that Cedric Poore took the jewelry to pawn.    When he was interviewed Wednesday, James Poore confirmed to investigators that he knew one of the victims and that he was in the apartment where the witnesses placed him. Before invoking his right to remain silent, he told investigators he knew one of the victims had used and sold illegal drugs and that Cedric drove a black van to the apartment the day of the murders.    The arrest report shows Cedric Poore denied being in the apartment the day of the murders and refused to speak to investigators any more.  Chief Jordan said the brothers both stayed at Fairmont Terrace Apartments. The property manager there told News On 6 that neither of them are on a lease.  Cedric Poore has been in Tulsa County jail on a traffic violation since January 14, and James Poore was arrested Wednesday morning. Department of Corrections records show both James and Cedric have been previously convicted and incarcerated for robbery with a firearm.  Chief Jordan said more arrests may still be made.  Mayor Dewey Bartlett released a statement Wednesday afternoon, in response to the news of the arrests:    ""The Tulsa Police Department is known for their quick efforts of finding perpetrators and they indeed lived up to their stellar reputation for this case. I have the utmost confidence in Chief Chuck Jordan and the Tulsa Police Department and I knew they would bring in those involved with this hideous quadruple murder in very short order. Although a direct tip from the public cannot be identified as the catalyst that led to the arrests, tips are always important, which is part of great police work from our force.""","Following an extensive investigation, authorities identified and apprehended two suspects believed to be responsible for the brutal killings that shocked the community.

The victims, all residents of the same apartment complex, were discovered in various states of undress and with signs of sexual assault, leading investigators to suspect a possible serial killer was at large.

The news of the arrests brought a sense of relief to residents of Fairmont Terrace Apartments and the broader community, as authorities had been under immense pressure to solve the case and prevent any further attacks.

Details about the suspects and their possible motives have not been released at this time, as the investigation is still ongoing. However, police assured the public that they are confident in the evidence gathered thus far and that the suspects will face justice."

Even if you're the Pope.  The only time it can affect you, however, is when you hear about it.  Or, worse, if someone makes the unpleasant comment directly to you.  Which brings us, quite naturally, to Twitter.  Here's a place that's just too perfect for the nasty, uncontrolled insult.  You can hide behind your egg and toss Bons-Molotovs at anyone you choose.  Some people choose Kim Kardashian.  She's an easy target.  Her life seems effortless. She's painfully wealthy, with a TV show, branded products left and right and an appearance fee surely only rivaled by Hillary Clinton.  Hers is such a cushy life that she can listen to Kanye West any time she wants.  Small wonder, then, that a Twitter user called Kevin James offered a wry dig at her countenance.  Is it me, or is @KimKardashian Sooo Self-absorbed.. even when she's saying Nothing.. lol.. & I Like the Kardashians #KUWTK -- Kevin James (@kevinjames4good) January 22, 2018  If you've ever been attacked on Twitter, you have choices.  You can reply aggressively. This is rarely worth it with a troll.  You can ignore it and even block the person who directed their bile your way.  You can wait for your own fans to descend upon this poor individual and shred him from tweet to tweet.  Or, you can be splendidly disarming.  This last path was the one taken by Kardashian.  No it's not you, I totally am! https://t.co/9ZxgPyVkko -- Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) January 22, 2018  Not everyone can pull this off with a straight face.  But here, Kardashian showed she understood the emotional essence of her interlocutor.  His biggest problem was surely that he isn't Kim Kardashian.  So she brought him onto her side with something so blessedly charming that it not only made her seem entirely self-aware -- rather than merely self-absorbed -- but also must have enticed a chuckle from Kevin James himself.  Indeed, it incited James to respond with quite considered contrition.  @KimKardashian Listen: altho my tweet came across ""seemingly"" disrespectful, it was just a thought/tweet worthy reaction.. lol... No DisRespect.. .. & I Appreciate ur Sense of humor, & @cassbrunelle14 for calling me out.. lol.. props to the Kardashian Empire -- Kevin James (@kevinjames4good) January 22, 2018  And so, without a word of insult, without so much as a miffed gesture, Kardashian took a situation that could have been emotionally straining and turned it into one the most pleasant feelings we have: laughter.  We'd all love to have that skill.  On truly good days, we find it.  On most other days, we walk away from a tense situation and only then do we start kicking ourselves that we didn't react a different way.  Harnessing it surely takes practice. A lot of practice.  Something Kardashian has surely done.","Is it true?

The country superstar opened up about his romance with the No Doubt frontwoman in a new interview with Billboard magazine.  As previously reported, Shelton told Stefani that he was splitting from Lambert during a meeting with their Voice coworkers. The “Misery” singer, who was new to the team at the time, got emotional.  “I won’t forget that day. I looked over at Gwen — who I didn’t really know — and she had these huge tears in her eyes. I thought, ‘Wow, she feels super bad for me!’” Shelton recalled. “She didn’t tell me much, because we didn’t know each other at the time, but she said, ‘I’m going through something very similar to what you’re going through. I understand. And I hate it.’”  Stefani was dealing with her own breakup at the time with Gavin Rossdale. (As Us Weekly exclusively revealed, the Bush rocker was cheating on her with their children’s nanny, Mindy Mann.) They announced they were ending their 13-year marriage in August 2015, one month after Shelton and Lambert announced they were divorcing after four years.  The “Came Here to Forget” singer and Stefani leaned on each other for support during the difficult time. The closer they got, the more Shelton saw Stefani in a new light.  “That’s kind of how our friendship and bond started, that day. It went from that, to checking in on each other once a week through email — ‘This s–t happened to me, what happened to you?’ — to maybe three times a week, then every day, to ‘Hey, here’s my phone number if you ever want to text,’” Shelton told Billboard. “Next thing I know, I wake up and she’s all I care about, and I’m ­wondering if she feels the same about me.”  “Gwen saved my life,” he added. “Who else on earth could understand going through a high-profile divorce from another musician? You can’t even imagine the similarities in our divorces.”  The two teamed up professionally too. Shelton included their collaborative track, “Go Ahead and Break My Heart,” on his 12th studio album, If I’m Honest.  “When we recorded the vocals for some of these songs, I was only six months removed from when all the crap went down,” Shelton said of his split from Lambert. “When you have a broken heart — at least, when I do — you got to get it out of your system. You want people to sympathize with you.

gossipcop-610873029,1,0,"The current editor in chief of Vogue magazine, Anna Wintour, has a net worth of $35 million. In addition to her net worth, she has a highly coveted position in the world of magazine publishing. She has also served as the (albeit not very flattering) inspiration for the popular novel and movie The Devil Wears Prada. Her career began in the world of fashion before moving into journalism, largely at the behest of her parents. In the year 1970, Wintour was hired on as an editorial assistant for the new Harper's & Queen fashion magazine. Even at this early stage of her career, Wintour divulged to coworkers that she had the desire to edit Vogue, a desire that would grow to be fulfilled nearly 20 years later. Wintour introduced sweeping changes to Vogue from her first issue forward. Many of these changes could be seen right on the cover. Wintour favored more naturalistic photography of lesser-known models outside, as opposed to the tight headshots the magazine had previously favored. Additionally, Wintour's first Vogue cover was also the first to feature a model wearing jeans, with the added bonus of wearing a bejeweled T-shirt valued at around $10,000. Under Wintour, Vogue has continued to be one of the pillars of fashion journalism.","Wintour's position at Vogue has given her a great deal of influence and power within the fashion industry, and she is well-known for her sharp sense of style and keen eye for design.

Anna Wintour's career began in the 1970s when she started working as a junior fashion editor at Harper's Bazaar. She quickly rose through the ranks and became a senior editor at the same magazine by the end of the decade. In 1983, Wintour moved to Vogue, where she has remained ever since, eventually becoming the editor in chief in 1988.

As the editor in chief of Vogue, Wintour has been instrumental in shaping the magazine's content and direction, as well as the broader fashion industry as a whole. Her influence extends far beyond the pages of the magazine, and she is known for her role in discovering and promoting new talent within the fashion world.

Wintour's personal style is often emulated and has even inspired a character in the hit movie ""The Devil Wears Prada."" Her attention to detail and her exacting standards have earned her both respect and fear within the industry. However, despite her sometimes intimidating demeanor, Wintour is also known for her dedication to charitable causes and her support of up-and-coming designers.

In conclusion, Anna Wintour's $35 million net worth is just one indicator of her success and influence within the fashion industry. Her position at Vogue, combined with her keen eye for design and her unwavering dedication to the world of fashion, have made her a force to be reckoned with."

Craig has already announced his intent to return as 007 in the franchise’s 25th film, and according to the National Enquirer, he’s still struggling to salvage what’s left of his marriage.  The Enquirer’s source claimed at the beginning of 2017, “Rachel and Daniel haven’t been happy for a while, and nearly called it quits last year.” The report claims that the married couple was in two separate filming locations at the beginning of the year, but continued to stay apart even after wrapping their respective films. The Enquirer then claims that they finally reunited in July after not being seen together in ‘554 days’.  According to the sources, the minute the outlet attempted to lock down an exclusive on the couple’s rocky marriage, both Rachel Weisz and Daniel Craig were seen arriving at New York’s Public Theater the next day, prompting the source to add, “The whole thing just seemed like too much of a coincidence. I don’t buy it for a minute.”  When you consider Daniel Craig’s own words, especially in the context of allegedly turning down a $150 million payday to star in two more James Bond films, he had stated, “Being on your own would be sad, sick, and weird. I don’t trust myself. I need that balance.” If these reports are to be believed, then Daniel Craig previously turned down starring in more Bond films to spend time with his family, but now – all of a sudden – he’s back to working on James Bond?  Either the report was never accurate to begin with, or he’s giving up on his marriage to Rachel Weisz. One would hope that the two have worked out whatever was troubling them in the first place, but given their own relationship and marriage histories – and how they’ve both jumped ship on long-term relationships at the drop of a hat – one wouldn’t be faulted for assuming that they are on their way to getting a divorce.  What do you guys think? Are Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz having marriage troubles, and is Daniel’s decision to take on the role of 007 again an indication that he’s giving up on his marriage? Or just a chance to have more career stability and/or cash in on a major paycheck? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.

The news comes as a surprise, given that Craig had previously stated that he would rather ""slash his wrists"" than play Bond again.

That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired. T","According to a report from Radar Online, Katie Holmes is ""desperately trying to escape"" her controlling ex-husband Tom Cruise and is seeking legal emancipation from him. The report claims that Katie is seeking emancipation in order to have more control over her own life and her daughter Suri's life.

A source close to Katie reportedly told Radar Online, ""Katie is fed up with Tom trying to control every aspect of her life, and she’s ready to take a stand. She’s been talking to her lawyers about her options, and emancipation is one of the things she’s considering.""

The report goes on to claim that Katie's decision to seek emancipation is partly due to her frustration over not being able to see her daughter Suri as often as she would like. The source reportedly said, ""Katie feels like she’s been a virtual prisoner in her own life for too long, and she’s determined to break free. She’s also frustrated that she can’t see Suri as often as she’d like because of Tom’s strict rules, and she’s ready to fight back.""

However, Gossip Cop is reporting that the Radar Online story is false and that there is no truth to the claims that Katie is seeking emancipation from Tom Cruise.

In other news, Katie Holmes has been spotted out and about with her boyfriend Jamie Foxx, who has been very supportive of her during this difficult time. The couple was seen grabbing dinner together at a posh restaurant in Los Angeles and were reportedly very affectionate towards each other.

Katie's fans are hoping that she will find happiness with Jamie Foxx and be able to put the drama with Tom Cruise behind her once and for all."

But for Victoria Adams, then known as Posh Spice, it turned out to be a key moment in her personal life too.  The video would soon catch the eye of Premier League soccer player David Beckham, who immediately picked out the brunette Spice Girl in her black PVC catsuit and matching gloves.  He declared: “That’s the girl for me and I'm going to get her! She's my idea of perfection. I knew that if she wanted me, we would be together forever.”  They later met at a Manchester United soccer players’ lounge, where it was love at first sight—although Victoria later admitted she was a little tipsy at the time.  The couple married in 1999 and had four children; sons Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz, and Harper. The pair have also forged a successful brand over their almost 20-year marriage, with Victoria starting a successful fashion label after attempting a less-than-stellar solo music career.  However, it hasn’t all been so rosy. The couple have endured a number of accusations of infidelity on David’s behalf, including from his former personal assistant Rebecca Loos in 2004.  The couple’s former nanny, Abbie Gibson, came forward in 2005 to stay their marriage was a sham, a claim hotly disputed by the Beckhams.  David retired from professional soccer in 2013, playing his final game in boots with the names of his wife and children stitched on to them.  He has consistently ranked among the highest earners in the sport. His net worth as of March 2017 is $450 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth—a number which Victoria matches through her own earnings.

From spray-tanned party animals to chic and professional parents, these pictures show just how far they’ve come.","They wanted to make sure that their fashion choices were iconic and memorable, just like the song itself.

Baker had the idea of dressing each member of the group in an outfit that was a nod to a different iconic style from the past. Thus, Mel B wore a leather jacket and miniskirt combo that was reminiscent of the 60s, Emma Bunton opted for a 40s-inspired tea dress, Geri Halliwell donned a 70s-style jumpsuit, Melanie C went for a 50s-inspired rockabilly look, and Victoria Beckham wore a 30s-style flapper dress.

The result was a video that not only became a massive hit, but also solidified the Spice Girls’ place in fashion history.

Swift's new album 1989 has already shot to the top on iTunes and has received favorable reviews from critics but her label, Big Machine Records, might not have been so confident that this offering from Swift would be a success.  ""I wasn't necessarily nervous about this album,"" Swift said. ""I think my label might have been a little nervous but they'll never say it now.""  Swift, whose roots were initially planted in country music, is now going full-steam ahead into Top 40 fare with 1989.  ""I knew I wanted to change the way I did things creatively,"" Swift told the View co-hosts. ""I knew I wanted to keep people on their toes. I didn't want anyone to have their feelings hurt by me changing directions creatively, because that's never the intention.""  With lyrics about empowerment and ridding one's self of negativity, Swift is once again being lauded as a feminist for a younger generation.  ""It's interesting how feminism has come up in conversation so much more in the last year,"" Swift said. ""I was never really taught the definition of feminism when I was a little girl and I wish I had been.""

Ed may be getting a phone call from his bestie sometime soon…”","Ed Sheeran and Taylor Swift are close friends who have collaborated on numerous projects throughout their careers. However, a recent report in a tabloid claimed that Sheeran had betrayed their friendship by secretly working with Katy Perry, who is allegedly Swift’s rival.

According to the report, Sheeran had collaborated with Perry on a new song, which was said to have upset Swift. The story further claimed that the “Bad Blood” singer was so hurt by Sheeran’s alleged betrayal that she had cut off all communication with him.

Gossip Cop has investigated the claims and found them to be completely false. A source close to Sheeran told the site that the singer has not collaborated with Perry and that there is no feud between him and Swift.

In fact, Sheeran and Swift recently performed together at the 2021 MTV Video Music Awards, where they sang a duet of their hit song “End Game.” The performance was well-received by fans and critics alike, further debunking the tabloid’s claims of a rift between the two musicians.

It’s not surprising that the tabloid would try to create drama where there is none, as celebrity feuds often sell magazines. However, in this case, the report is simply untrue, and Sheeran and Swift’s friendship remains strong."

The actor appears on the September cover of GQ where he explained why he chooses to stay very quiet when it comes to his private life.  “I always think the risk reward is very much weighted in the wrong direction,” Pattinson, 31, said of opening up in interviews. “If I could stay silent, I would.”  Pattinson has been dating singer F.K.A. Twigs since 2014, and recently told Howard Stern they were “kind of” engaged. But when asked by GQ if he was getting married, the actor — who revealed he calls his girlfriend Twigs — responded with a noncommittal “eh.”  Daniel Jackson/GQ  Pattinson said that he went to therapy a few years ago – and his therapist commented that he was good at “talking without saying anything.” He said he uses that skill in all his interviews. The Good Time actor explained that he chooses to stay private so people don’t form ideas about his personality that may later change and label him as dishonest.  RELATED: Celeb Quotes of the Day: Jennifer Lawrence, Emma Stone & More  “I want to be misunderstood,” he told the magazine after declining to talk about anything personal. “People are always changing, and the more you put something down in print, people form opinions and they’re constantly creating who they think you are.

He would also try to confuse photographers by having all of his friends order different rides out of restaurants when they were together and sending the cars to different places after trading outfits with one of his friends. Pattinson also recalled riding in trunks several times to hide from the photographers – and once drove around all night when one was tailing him to find out where his new house is.  “There are ways to disappear, like, fairly easily,” he said. “It just involves effort, and most people can’t be bothered to put the effort in.”  Good Time hits theaters August 11.","""I guess I just didn't grow up with a sense of 'I want everyone to know everything about me.'

The only time it's really annoying is when you're sitting in a restaurant and people start taking pictures. But I don't understand why anyone would want to take pictures of me in a restaurant anyway.""

Pattinson, who is currently filming The Batman, also revealed that he avoids social media for the most part.

""I still don't understand it, and I've been around it for years,"" he said. ""I don't understand why anyone would want to share anything about their life on social media. It's like the opposite of what I want to do.""

The actor, who has been linked to actresses such as Kristen Stewart and FKA Twigs, has been quietly dating model and artist Suki Waterhouse for several months. Despite the relationship being kept under wraps, Pattinson doesn't seem to be in a rush to make it public.

""I mean, I understand why people do it, and it's totally fine,"" he said. ""It's just not something I've ever wanted to do. I don't want people to know what I'm doing. I want to be a ghost.""

In recent years, Pattinson has been focusing on his career rather than his personal life, appearing in films such as Good Time, The Lighthouse, and The King. His upcoming role as Bruce Wayne/Batman in The Batman has been praised by fans and critics alike.

""I'm just trying to be less self-conscious,"" he told GQ. ""I don't know if it's even possible. I'm still pretty self-conscious."""

Caitlyn touched down in London town last week to promote her to promote her juicy new autobiography The Secrets Of My Life (she even popped by the This Morning studios) and many are speculating whether she had a secret meeting with Celebrity Big Brother bosses.  Sources have told the Daily Star: ""The bookers are really keen to have Caitlyn in the house.  ""They know she’d be TV gold so they’re prepared to break the bank for her.

Caitlyn is no stranger to reality telly – she's starred in Keeping Up With The Kardashians since forevs, and even had her own show I Am Cait – and after proof that the Kardashian/Jenner family feud is still rife, this could be the perfect opportunity for her to set the record straight.  She even recently revealed that she hasn't spoken to Kim Kardashian in a 'very long time'.  ""I love Kimberly, I think she's a wonderful person,"" Caitlyn said on Australia's Today show.

gossipcop-7658353025,1,0,"“A Star Is Born” is that thing we always yearn for but so rarely get to see: a transcendent Hollywood movie. It’s the fourth remake of a story that dates back to 1932, but this one has a look and vibe all its own — rapturous and swooning, but also delicate and intimate and luminous. It’s set in the present day, but in spirit it’s a sophisticated retro ’70s drama built around the uncanny flow of feeling that develops between the movie’s two stars: Bradley Cooper, who plays Jackson Maine, a hard-drinking, bad-ol’-boy redneck rock ‘n’ roller who is still hanging on as a popular attraction but has lost the lust for what he’s doing, and Lady Gaga, in her fetching and accomplished movie-star debut, as Ally, an ingenuous, fresh-faced singer-songwriter who becomes his lover and stage partner before rocketing on her own into the new pop stratosphere. She takes off as he slowly crashes — that’s the soapy tragic “Star Is Born” concept. But what the movie does is to take this fabled melodramatic romantic seesaw and turn it into something indelibly heartfelt and revealing. Cooper directed the movie himself, working from a script he co-wrote with Eric Roth and Will Fetters, and to say that he does a good job would be to understate his accomplishment. As a filmmaker, Bradley Cooper gets right onto the high wire, staging scenes that take their time and play out with a shaggy intimacy that’s shorn of the usual “beats.” The new “Star Is Born” is a total emotional knockout, but it’s also a movie that gets you to believe, at every step, in the complicated rapture of the story it’s telling. More Reviews Venice Film review: 'Isis, Tomorrow. The Lost Souls of Mosul' Telluride Film Review: 'They'll Love Me When I'm Dead' The 1976 version, starring Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson, had some terrific cornball love songs, but they didn’t belong anywhere near the stadium-rock stage, and neither did Streisand, which is part of why the movie came off as borderline ludicrous. It seemed stranded, with a kind of campy sincere ineptitude, between three worlds: Old Hollywood, New Hollywood, and Barbra Streisand rock-princess fantasy. But from the electrifying opening moments of the new version, in which Jackson, boozy and raw, with his sunburned squint and hard-bitten shit-kicker sexiness, takes the stage of a gigantic stadium and launches into a grinding slow rocker that sounds like “Victim of Love”-era Eagles as done by the Allman Brothers, the movie is thrillingly authentic. That’s no minor accomplishment. Hollywood almost never succeeds in nailing the rock world, but “A Star Is Born,” though a love story through and through, is the most lived-in rock ‘n’ roll movie since “Almost Famous.” And that absolute looks right, sounds right, feels right verisimilitude sets the stage for everything that follows. Jackson, who looks to be in his mid-40s, has been around long enough that he now occupies a grey zone between legend and nostalgia. He can still fill an arena full of screaming fans, and his old hits have become classic-rock chestnuts, but his sound and persona have long slipped out of the zeitgeist. His whole outlaw look — the beard and rancher’s hat, the Kristofferson-meets-Skynyrd soused macho twinkle — mark him as a charismatic relic, and the grand irony is this: What that look, and sound, are all about is an era when rock ‘n’ roll strutted its “authenticity,” but now that he’s out of date, Jackson’s authenticity looks more than ever like a showbiz conceit, frozen in amber. It’s a part he’s playing, an image he’s working — and secretly struggling — to keep alive. He’s got a signature ballad that goes “Maybe it’s time to let the old ways die,” and when he wrote it (long ago), he probably didn’t know that he was talking about himself. In the first of many telling jump cuts, the film leaps from his on-stage glory to Jackson slinking into the back of his car, weary and alone, grabbing the bottle of gin he’s got stashed there. He takes a guzzle, and Coop","A Star Is Born, the highly anticipated film that has captured the hearts and minds of audiences worldwide, has been hailed as a transcendent Hollywood movie experience. Directed by Bradley Cooper and starring Lady Gaga, the movie tells the story of a rising star and her relationship with a fading musician, played by Cooper.

Critics have praised the film for its raw emotional depth, powerful performances, and exceptional storytelling. The New York Times called it ""a masterpiece of modern cinema,"" while The Guardian described it as ""a heart-wrenching, soul-stirring, and unforgettable film.""

A Star Is Born has also resonated with audiences, becoming a box office success and generating significant Oscar buzz. The film has been nominated for multiple Golden Globes, including Best Motion Picture – Drama, Best Director, and Best Actress for Lady Gaga's performance.

In an industry often criticized for its formulaic and uninspired output, A Star Is Born stands out as a rare gem that delivers on its promise of a transcendent Hollywood movie experience.

The couple “vowed to keep their relationship to themselves. They’ve done everything they can to keep it that way.”","Taylor Swift's life has been a roller coaster of highs and lows when it comes to her personal relationships. However, it seems that she has finally found her equilibrium in the form of Joe Alwyn. According to Us Weekly, the British actor has been instrumental in teaching Swift the value of keeping her personal life private. This newfound sense of privacy has reportedly led to a happier and more fulfilling life for the pop star.

Swift has been notoriously open about her relationships in the past, with songs, interviews, and social media posts giving fans a glimpse into her love life. However, since her relationship with Alwyn began in 2016, the singer has been much more guarded about her personal life. This change has apparently resulted in a sense of contentment that is evident to those close to her.

A source close to Swift revealed to Us Weekly that the ""Shake It Off"" singer is happier than ever, thanks to Alwyn's influence. The couple has managed to keep their relationship largely out of the public eye, allowing them to focus on their love and personal growth without the added pressure of media scrutiny.

In an era where celebrities often feel compelled to share every detail of their lives on social media, Swift's decision to keep her relationship with Alwyn private is a refreshing change. It serves as a reminder that privacy is a valuable commodity, even for those in the public eye. As Swift continues to find happiness in her personal life, her fans will undoubtedly continue to support her and her music."

Years later, Brad regrets leaving the Friends star for his now-ex Angelina Jolie, a source told In Touch exclusively.  Following his 2016 separation from Angie, Brad sobered up and sought therapy. And now, he’s “in touch with emotions and his true self like never before,” the source says.  Brad Pitt finally opens up about his bitter divorce with Angelina Jolie  And it seems like this self-awareness comes with some great realisations. “He has come to realise that leaving Jen for Angelina was one of the biggest mistakes of his life,” the source adds. “And while he’s not in love with Jen, he realises how much he does love her. Brad keeps telling friends that he’s seeing everything more clearly.”  However, these realisations are obviously far too late. Jennifer has been married to Wanderlust co-star Justin Theroux for two years now.  And while Brad would “never dream of” ruining his ex’s new marriage, he “would take a second chance at love with Jen in a heartbeat.”  If they can’t be romantic partners, though, the War Machine star wants Jen to be his partner in other pursuits, In Touch further reported.  Brad Pitt “much happier” following split from Angelina Jolie  “They worked well together” when they formed the production company Plan B in 2001, an insider close to Brad told In Touch. “He wants Jen involved again as he produces and develops more and more high-quality film and cable TV products.”  That kind of professional partnership could pay off for Jen, too, since the insider states she wants in on “prestige projects” under his production banner. “She’d be beyond thrilled to win an Academy Award for Best Actress — something that’s evaded both her and Angelina.”  “He still considers Jen the love of his life,” the source concluded.

On Monday, the actress told People that her co-stars altered a pre-show ritual when she was pregnant during Seasons 4 and 5 to include her unborn child — her now 20-year-old son, Julian Murray Stern.  “The six of us would do a huddle backstage and just say, ‘All right, have a good show, love you love you love you love you,’” Kudrow, 55, told the outlet. “And when I was pregnant, then they would say, ‘Have a great show, love you love you — love you, little Julian!’ ’Cause we knew it was a boy and that was his name.”  She added: “So sweet, they included my little fetus in the huddle.”  The stars of “Friends” embraced one another’s children at other times, too.

Together, they have the same kind of joys and sorrows that just about every teenager has while growing up. This show parodied many of the attitudes, events and fads of the 70s, along with those who grew up at the time. Written by Jean-Marc Rocher <rocher@fiberbit.net>","Title: A Glimpse into the Life of a 1970s Teenager

In a small town in Wisconsin during the mid-1970s, Eric Forman, a typical high school student, navigated the challenges of adolescence. Amidst a backdrop of a rapidly changing America, Forman's life unfolded in the warmth of his family home and the camaraderie of his close-knit group of friends.

Forman's story, although specific to his time and place, resonates with the universal themes of teenage experience. His journey through the trials and tribulations of high school, his search for identity, and his pursuit of love and acceptance are all too familiar to generations of young people.

Set against the backdrop of a nation in transition, Forman's coming-of-age tale captures the essence of a bygone era. The social and cultural upheaval of the 1970s provides a rich context for Forman's personal growth, as he grapples with the complexities of family, friendship, and romance.

gossipcop-1716370499,1,0,"Dakota Johnson; most of us know her as the actress from Fifty Shades of Grey. While we may have seen Johnson in some pretty intimate positions on-screen, there’s definitely a lot we don’t know about the Fifty Shades star. Like, for instance, the superfluity of familiar names in her family tree. Seeing that her popular movie, Fifty Shades Darker came out on the day of love—Valentine's Day—it's only fitting to dedicate a piece to the actress who brought us the sexy and quaint, Anastasia Steele. Johnson, after all, has become somewhat something of a Valentine’s Day staple, herself. Here are 15 facts about Dakota Johnson or, as some might call her, ""that girl from Fifty Shades of Grey."" We guarantee that she will no longer by ""that girl"" by the end of the list! 15 Her Family Tree Is Full Of Famous Faces You know how we said there are a few familiar names in her family tree? Well, we weren’t lying. Her parents are fellow actors, Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson. Unfortunately, her parents divorced in 1994 so Dakota had to split her time between the two. ""It was the only way that I could be with them,"" she said in an interview for Cosmopolitan. ""And since they were divorced, I would spend two weeks with one and two weeks with the other, traveling with a tutor."" But wait, it gets better. Her maternal grandmother (can you guess..) is Hitchcock actress Tippi Hedren. Yes, that’s right, so clearly creative talent lies in that family. We’ve never heard of a family tree with so many famous names! Thanksgiving is probably a whirlwind. Now, Dakota Johnson is another famous name in that tree. 14 She’s An Animal Rights Activist advertising Just like her grandmother Tippi Hedren, Dakota Johnson is also an animal rights activist. Like grandmother, like granddaughter shall we say? As animal lovers ourselves, we’re pleased to hear that she’s following in her grandmother’s footsteps—both in acting and in animal rights. In 2014, Johnson saved 12 horses from being slaughtered by paying for them. What a sweet thing to do! We bet her grandmother was really proud. It’s always so great to hear about celebrities doing positive things - so naturally, we’re happy to hear of Dakota’s compassionate side. We admit we have a soft spot for animal lovers, but who doesn't? We always love hearing about people doing good deeds for animals and it’s always nice to hear celebrities using their celebrity title for the better. 13 She Grew Up Shooting Guns And Riding Horses In Colorado She may play the innocent and naive Anastasia Steele in the Fifty Shades movies, but growing up Johnson was anything but naive. She grew up in Colorado at her dad’s house, where she learned to build a fire, ride a horse, ride motorbikes, and even shoot a gun. And this was all before she was just 10 years old! Sounds like a badass kid to us! But when she wasn’t at her father’s house, she was at her mom’s house in L.A. which she also loved. It's hard to imagine a 10 year old these days shooting guns, riding motorbikes, or building fires without being grounded. But it sounds like she had a pretty inspiring and freeing childhood which makes us fall for the actress all the more. 12 She Never Dates advertising By the header, we mean she never has casual relationships. She only has long-term relationships. Good for her, is all we can say! You hear of so many celebrities who are constantly dating other celebrities. You can barely keep up with who they’re dating these days. It seems to be one guy or girl after another. So it’s great to hear of Dakota’s conservative views on relationships. Apparently she’s only ever been in long-term, serious relationships; she doesn’t just date. That probably explains why she’s been in a relationship with model Matthew Hitt since 2014. Yes, it’s been a kind of an on-and-off relationship but they’ve been in it for the long haul so far. So, to sum up, we like her whole dating attitude. The commitment is great and saves you a lot of time. 11 She HATED School It seems l","Here are some interesting facts about the actress that might just surprise you.

1. She’s a member of a very famous Hollywood family: Johnson comes from a long line of famous actors and actresses. Her grandmother is legendary actress Tippi Hedren, who starred in Alfred Hitchcock’s The Birds. Her mother is Melanie Griffith, who has been in numerous films including Working Girl and Mulholland Drive. And her father is Don Johnson, known for his roles in Miami Vice and Nash Bridges.
2. She initially turned down the role of Anastasia Steele: Before Johnson was cast as Anastasia Steele in the Fifty Shades series, she actually turned down the role. It was only after her mother, Melanie Griffith, convinced her to take it that she reconsidered and eventually accepted the part.
3. She started her career as a model: Before becoming an actress, Johnson began her career as a model. She signed with IMG Models in 2009 and has since modeled for brands like Mango and Victoria’s Secret.
4. She’s a singer too: In addition to acting and modeling, Johnson is also a talented singer. She released her first single, “Cold Cold Man,” in 2015 under the stage name"

Her performance in “The Age of Adaline” — as a woman “cursed” to stay 30 forever — was like watching a mermaid ride a bike. She tries. But her acting hasn’t yet caught up to her algorithm-generated beauty. Alas, there may be no algorithmic solution for that.  So I was less than psyched at the prospect of seeing her shiver on a buoy, stitch her own wounds, talk to animals or play a Nancy. And, as refreshing as it is watching her stand on a surfboard, it’s refreshment that provides some perspective. While some actors make sense on movie screens, there are others who might make better sense on a can of something — beer, beans, air. I can hear you, Hudson skeptics. And all I can say is that the heart wants what the heart wants. I’d actually buy whatever Ms. Hudson was on the can of.  There might be no appreciable industrial difference between what a Kate Hudson can do versus your Blake Livelys. I don’t think they’re interchangeable, but sometimes the movies beg to differ, and the market corrects itself. Don’t fall in love with Mark Harmon, because here comes Kevin Costner. And sell your Brad Rowe stock, because he’s just going to be replaced by Brad Pitt. (In the late 1990s, that pretty much happened.) But there are continuums, too. Channing Tatum, for instance, is a more elastic, hip-hop-era Brendan Fraser upgrade.  Lots of parts that have gone to Ms. Lively feel as if Ms. Hudson could have played them. But something happened, and suddenly it was someone else’s turn to be “it.” (It’s always someone else’s turn.) And part of what annoys me about the lack of Kate Hudson in my life and the surfeit of Ms. Lively is the same thing that makes me angry when a perfectly good piece of software gets a superfluous update, or a zealous waiter takes my plate at a restaurant: I wasn’t done with that.","I, at least, struggle to understand her career. Her performance as a junkie in ""The Town"" features the ""Bride Wars"" of Boston accents.

Actress Amy Adams has faced a barrage of criticism for her inconsistent portrayal of a Boston accent in the crime thriller ""The Town."" While her performance as a recovering junkie has been praised, critics argue that her wavering accent detracts from the overall believability of the character.

In a film that delves into the gritty world of bank robberies and the complex relationships that drive them, the inconsistency of Adams' accent has become a distracting element. Comparisons have been drawn to the 2009 romantic comedy ""Bride Wars,"" in which Adams also appeared, and her character's accent in that film was similarly scrutinized.

Despite the accent controversy, ""The Town"" has received positive reviews for its tense plot and strong acting performances. Director Ben Affleck, who also stars in the film, has been praised for his ability to create a realistic and engaging portrayal of life in the streets of Boston.

However, the spotlight on Adams' accent has raised questions about the importance of authenticity in film performances. As the movie industry becomes more global, actors are increasingly called upon to portray characters with diverse backgrounds. While some may argue that a perfect accent is not crucial to a performance's success, others maintain that it is a crucial element in creating a believable character."

The first time that she is mentioned in the novel is during the chapter ""The New Marguerite"", where it is revealed that she could not perform at the ceremony for the former managers. Later in the novel, she is threatened by Erik that if she performs at the Opera House ""a great misfortune will strike"". She shrugs the warning off and performs anyway. When she does, however, croaking noises come out of her mouth and the chandelier comes crashing down. Ashamed, she hides from the public view for a few weeks, before making a return to the opera house.  Carlotta is portrayed by Virginia Pearson in the original 1925 silent film with Lon Chaney. In 1929, new sound scenes were filmed and Mary Fabian was recast as Carlotta, due to the fact that she could sing. Virginia Pearson still appeared in new scenes, now playing Carlotta's mother. These changes are also the same in the 1929 silent, foreign cut of the film (which is most commonly viewed).  In the 1943 film version, she is Mme. Biancarolli who has been drugged by the Phantom and murdered along with her maid when she tries to force him to take off his prop mask.  In Andrew Lloyd Webber's production, Carlotta (last name Giudicelli) is from Italy and is one of the major singing parts. The opera company's prima donna, she despises Christine Daaé and sees the younger woman as a threat to her job and Phantom´s courtesan, when Christine achieves prominence due to the Phantom's dirty tricks. Carlotta and tenor Ubaldo Piangi are lovers; she often turns to him for consolation when things go wrong, and she breaks down crying when his murdered body is discovered onstage. The film reveals that she likes poodles.  In the Lloyd Webber-Joel Schumacher 2004 film version, she was played by Minnie Driver.[1] Due to Driver's lack of experience in opera, her singing voice was dubbed by opera singer Margaret Preece, although she lent her actual voice to the song ""Learn to Be Lonely"" during the end credits.  In Nicholas Meyer's novel The Canary Trainer, the characters of Carlotta and La Sorelli are combined into one, despite being mentioned as separate characters in the original novel. In Kim Newman's short story ""Angels of Music"" from the Tales of the Shadowmen anthology series, Carlotta is implied to be the ancestor of Bianca Castafiore from The Adventures of Tintin comic series.","Carlotta, a minor character in Gaston Leroux's 1909 novel The Phantom of the Opera, has been brought to life in a new theatrical adaptation. Hailing from Spain, the fictional character plays a pivotal role in the story, which takes place at the Paris Opera House.

In this latest adaptation, Carlotta is portrayed by a talented young actress who captures the essence of the character with her stunning performance. Audiences are transported to a world of mystery and intrigue as they witness the unfolding drama between Carlotta, the Phantom, and the other characters in the story.

Middleton had a comfortable upbringing before she became the first commoner to join the royal family after she married William in 2011. But Middleton’s net worth ballooned once she became a duchess.  Here’s everything we know about Middleton’s net worth:  What is Kate Middleton’s net worth?  The 36 year-old mother of three — who gave birth to a second baby boy in April — is worth at least £5 million, or $7 million, according to global wealth-tracking firm Wealth-X, though some estimates put her net worth as high as £7.3 million, or $10 million. Middleton’s wealth is mostly in cash because she doesn’t have a personal portfolio of property or artwork.  That being said, Middleton’s net worth is a lot less than her prince — Wealth-X estimates Prince William’s net worth is at least $30 million, though some reports put his fortune closer to $40 million. According to Wealth-X, $19 million of Prince William’s wealth is in cash. The wealth tracking firm also noted that William has an expensive helicopter fit for a royal — an Augusta A109S Grand helicopter which is valued at $11 million.  Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, Prince George of Cambridge and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge arrive for a children's party for Military families during the Royal Tour of Canada on September 29, 2016 in Victoria, Canada. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  What do we know about Kate Middleton’s money?  Most of Middleton’s net worth stems from Party Pieces, an online party supplies business started by her parents. The company is estimated to be worth around £30 million, or $50 million, thanks in no small part to the exposure it gets from being associated with the royals, according to royal expert Marlene Koenig.  Prior to her life as a full-time duchess, Middleton worked for the family business and was a part-time accessories buyer for a retailer called Jigsaw.  Growing up, Kate and her two siblings, Pippa and James Middleton, attended expensive privates schools from a young age, with years of tuition for just one child estimated to be at least £250,000, or $350,000. Kate met Prince William while in college in Scotland at the prestigious University of St. Andrew’s. She graduated in 2005 with a degree in Art History.  How did Kate Middleton’s net worth change after marrying Prince William?  Joining the royal family meant that Middleton was marrying into an incredible $88 billion fortune amassed over generations.  Before Will and Kate became the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and moved into a 20-room apartment in Kensington Palace, Kate lived in an apartment purchased by her parents in the Chelsea neighborhood of London believed to be worth £1 million, or $1.4 million.  Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge smile following their marriage at Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011 in London, England. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  But once Kate officially became a royal she didn’t need to spend much of her own money anymore. Most of her living costs are covered by the private estate Prince Charles manages, the Duchy of Cornwall. The revenue from the Duchy of Cornwall pays for the most of Prince Charles and his family’s royal expenses: things like official travel, wardrobe, housing and staff costs. When Meghan Markle marries Prince Harry on May 19, she too, will get to keep most of her own money — her net worth is believed to be about $5 million — as the Duchy of Cornwall will also absorb the majority of her living costs associated with royal responsibilities.

But nothing else was off-limits, as Sawyer caught up with Jenner nearly two years after the TV journalist had done their last emotional interview.

I reach out to them,"" commented the former ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians"" star.  Jenner told Sawyer that she has ""never been on a date"" in the two years since she came out as transgender, and doesn't really see dating in her future.

She expressed gratitude for the support she has received from her loved ones, as well as the larger community, which has helped her navigate the complexities of her transition.

Jenner's decision to speak publicly about her final surgery aims to shed light on the challenges faced by transgender individuals, and to promote a greater understanding of the transgender experience. By sharing her story, she hopes to inspire others who are struggling with their own gender identity to find the strength and courage to be true to themselves.

As Jenner continues to advocate for transgender rights and visibility, her journey serves as a powerful testament to the resilience of the human spirit, and the transformative power of self-acceptance and love."

Khloe spends as much time in Cleveland as possible and has spies in every city his team plays in.”  HollywoodLifers, do you think Khloe will listen to Iggy?","International Women's Day may have come and gone, but the spirit of unity and empowerment it represents is still alive in the hearts of many. One such individual is Australian rapper Iggy Azalea, who is using the occasion to highlight a concern close to her heart. In a recent interview, Azalea expressed her concerns about her close friend, Khloe Kardashian, and the potential risks she may be facing in her relationship with basketball player Tristan Thompson.

Azalea, who has had her own fair share of high-profile relationships, cautioned Kardashian against trusting Thompson too deeply. The rapper pointed to the athlete's history with his ex, Jordan Craig, as a potential source of heartbreak for Kardashian. Craig and Thompson share a son together, and their relationship ended amid rumors of infidelity.

Azalea's concern for her friend is a testament to the strong bond between women, even in the face of adversity. While International Women's Day is a single day on the calendar, its message of solidarity and support should resonate throughout the year. By speaking out on behalf of her friend, Iggy Azalea is demonstrating that the fight for women's rights and well-being is an ongoing struggle that transcends any single day of recognition."
gossipcop-5251247668,1,0,"Despite rumors of a split, Rihanna is still very much together with boyfriend of one year Hassan Jameel. We’ve got the pics of their steamy Mexican getaway  Rihanna has kept her one year romance with Saudi billionaire Hassan Jameel super private. So when rumors surfaced in June that they had broken up fans were waiting to see proof they were still a couple. They got it on July 9 when pics surfaced of the 30-year-old singer and the businessman on a sexy Mexican getaway. The two appeared to be locked in a animated conversation as bikini clad RiRi is seen pointing her right index finger in the air with her mouth open, looking like she had something important to say. In another pic Hassan is seen looking back at her with his hand on his chest as if they’re involved in a somewhat heated conversation. CLICK HERE to see all the pics.  On June 1 MediaTakeOut claimed RiRi had dumped Hassan. The site reported that “Rihanna just got tired of him. She gets tired of men sometimes,” an alleged insider told them. They said that the handsome billionaire wasn’t doing too well after the split. “Of course Rihanna broke his heart. That’s what she does — break men’s hearts.” Since Rihanna has never commented on her romance with Hassan and goes to great lengths to keep their relationship away from the public eye, MTO’s report spread like wildfire.  Obviously something is still on between Rihanna and Hassan, as they are having a hot summer together. They were first photographed a year ago making out in a pool in Spain. They’ve only been pictured a handful of times since, keeping their love undercover. The “Work” singer’s previous relationship was with Drake, 31, and it played out in public. He even professed his years of love to her in front of the world while presenting her with the Video Vanguard award at the 2016 VMAs. After having the public know all about their dating business, Ri has wisely kept her romance with Hassan as far out of the public eye as possible.  Rihanna revealed recently that Drake gushing about her on live TV made her cringe. In a May 2018 interview with Vogue, she said “Waiting through that speech was probably the most uncomfortable part. I don’t like too many compliments; I don’t like to be put on blast.” As for where she stands with Drizzy, she told the mag that they haven’t spoken and that “We don’t have a friendship now, but we’re not enemies either. It is what it is.” However she did come the close to discussing her relationship with Hassan, telling the publication that she dating and she is happy. “I used to feel guilty about taking personal time,” she revealed, “but I also think I never met someone who was worth it before,” she said about her romance with Hassan.","But the proof is in the pics, and they were spotted getting super cozy during a steamy Mexican getaway.

Despite rumors of a split, the couple is still going strong, and these pics are the ultimate evidence. Rihanna and Hassan were snapped walking hand in hand on the beach, sharing a passionate kiss, and even getting playful in the ocean.

The ""Work"" singer has been fiercely protective of her relationship with Hassan, and it's clear to see why. These intimate moments between the two show just how deeply in love they are.

So, let's put those breakup rumors to rest once and for all. Rihanna and Hassan are very much still together, and their love is as hot as ever."
gossipcop-6909849467,1,0,"Now, it’s official: Star Wars fans will have one final chance to say goodbye to Carrie Fisher, with Lucasfilm announcing that the actress, who died in December 2016, will appear in next year’s Star Wars: Episode IX.  In a statement, director J.J. Abrams sought to put concerns about potential CGI resurrections to rest, saying that the new movie will use “unseen footage we shot together in Episode VII” and assuring fans that “we were never going to recast, or use a CG character.” While this is, undoubtedly, comforting, it would also appear to offer particular clues about the role Fisher — or, more specifically, her character, Leia Organa — will play in the movie.  Firstly: Purely for practical purposes, Leia’s presence in the movie will be small. If nothing else, there can’t be that much extraneous, unseen footage from 2015's Star Wars: The Force Awakens; she was barely in that movie, so unless large swaths of scenes were shot but never even hinted at by anyone involved in the production, there’s limited material to draw from in the first place, and surely not everything available will be used.  Considering the context of the footage, it also limits the potential use for Episode IX. Leia appeared in few scenes and locations in The Force Awakens. Leia was on Takodana, rescuing Han, Chewbacca, Rey and Finn, and then at the Resistance base on D’Qar, where she takes part in planning, and later monitoring, the attack on Starkiller Base. Aside from brief interludes with Han and, later, Rey, she’s very much in “harried leader” mode throughout the movie. Does this mean that this is the Leia we’ll see in Episode IX, even after losing her ex-husband, and then her brother, in the previous two movies?  (It’s possible that the Fisher footage will end up being just a minor flashback, used to punctuate a contemporary moment; memories during her funeral, as some on social media have already suggested. If so, then the above problem is side-stepped, to a degree.)  Abrams’ comments leave space for some level of postproduction trickery to be applied to the Fisher footage. Presumably, Fisher will be intercut with new footage of actors shot specifically for Episode IX. Will digital trickery be used to make sure that Fisher shares a location with the other cast members? If so, will that be all that’s altered? What about costuming choices? For that matter, what about the potential for posthumous dubbing or soundalikes used for dialogue where Leia is off-camera or not in close-up? Abrams said that the movie would never use a CG character, but what about a performance augmented or altered by CG?  Of course, if any such edits or alterations are made, they’ll have to be done with subtlety and sensitivity. This is key to the entire enterprise of including footage of Fisher posthumously. For as much as fans want to be able to say goodbye to the actress, and also to Leia, they want to do so in a manner that feels appropriate and respectful to both. While Abrams and Lucasfilm — and Fisher’s family, especially daughter Billie Lourd, named in Abrams’ statement — want to provide both closure and tribute to Leia and Fisher alike with this move, they’re courting backlash if this isn’t done perfectly.  That the footage will come from The Force Awakens feels particularly fitting, then; that, after all, was a project that already came with expectations and looming accusations from fandom expecting the worst. It’s also perhaps a reminder that those involved with this move love the mythology — and loved Fisher as a person — as much as anyone else, if not more so, and will be approaching it with the utmost care.  Everyone will, inevitably, remain worried until the final product appears onscreen, but perhaps we can rest just slightly in the meantime.","Fisher’s brother, Todd Fisher, confirmed the news to the New York Daily News, revealing that the film will use unreleased footage of the actress from Star Wars: The Force Awakens to give her character, General Leia Organa, a fitting send-off.

“There’s a lot of minutes of footage,” Todd Fisher told the newspaper. “I don’t know what else is available, but there’s a lot of stuff. Whether they’re gonna use it all, I’m not sure.”

The announcement comes after months of speculation about Fisher’s possible appearance in the final installment of the Skywalker saga. While Lucasfilm had previously stated that Leia’s story would be wrapped up using unseen footage, the company had not confirmed whether Fisher would be featured in Episode IX until now.

Fisher’s daughter, Billie Lourd, who has been involved in the discussions surrounding her mother’s appearance in the film, recently told the New York Times that she is “grateful” for the opportunity to give Fisher’s character a proper farewell.

“I’m just grateful that she (Fisher) had the opportunity to even be in the films, because I know she loved it so much,” Lourd said. “She loved being in the Star Wars universe, and I think it’s amazing that she got to be a part of something so big and so meaningful to people.”

Star Wars: Episode IX is set to hit theaters in December 2019, and fans around the world are eagerly anticipating the final chapter in the saga. With the confirmation that Carrie Fisher will appear in the film, audiences can now look forward to a fitting tribute to the beloved actress and her iconic character."

gossipcop-8598629116,1,1,"Vacation time is here let’s go girl A post shared by Steve Harvey (@iamsteveharveytv) on Jul 8, 2018 at 1:04pm PDT  Steve Harvey has effectively dispelled a rumor that bubbled up last week, claiming that he and wife Marjorie Harvey are headed for a $400 million divorce.  The talk show host on Sunday posted a photo on Instagram of him and his wife boarding a private jet.  “Vacation time is here, let’s go girl,” he captioned the Sunday, July 8 image.  The photo, which was similar to one Marjorie posted on her Instagram Story, got praise from fans.  “God bless….. stay focus[ed] don’t [lose] the vision🙏💍.”  “Enjoy yourselves, you guys deserve this vacation. Come back well rested and a stronger bond and marriage. Yahoo for the Harveys.”  Days earlier, RadarOnline reported that Marjorie walked out on Steve because he had been getting close with Kris Jenner during closed-door business meetings and ongoing phone calls and text messages.  “There was a huge blowout fight and Marjorie walked out threatening divorce,” a source told the gossip site of the reported split. “There’s no way she was going to put up with Steve hanging around a man-eater like Kris — especially since he’s proven time and again he can’t be trusted.”  Although Jenner was reportedly just stringing Steve along to get tips on TV success, one of his former talk show employes said Marjorie knows her man, who is twice divorced and cheated on both wives with the next.  “Steve has a wandering eye and he loves women!” the ex-worker told Radar anonymously. “He’s cheated during his previous marriages, and Marjorie knows he could do it again. She knows her man’s weakness — knows everything about him! That’s why she watches him so closely.”  The rumor was the talk of Twitter.  “Am I late?? Did everyone know Steve Harvey is being accused of cheating on Marjorie with Kris Jenner?! I didn’t know this 😂.”  “Steve Harvey left his wife to marry Marjorie, his side b—- of 20 years, and now she’s leaving him and running his pockets. Hilarious. Karma’s a bad b—-.”  “Boyyy if this Steve Harvey rumor is true… he gon be sick for a minute. He loves him some Marjorie.”","In a recent Instagram post, the comedian and television host wrote, ""Vacation time is here let's go girl,"" accompanied by a photo of the couple enjoying a sun-kissed beach getaway. The picture seems to serve as a direct response to the false tabloid story, as the Harveys appear to be very much in love and not dealing with any marital turmoil. The couple has been married since 2007 and has been vocal about their commitment to each other and their family."

gossipcop-8854037683,1,1,"Titanic II is set to launch in less than two years — not in movie theaters, but on the open sea.  A replica of the world’s most famous “unsinkable” ship — which struck an iceberg and sank on its maiden voyage on April 15, 1912, killing 1,503 people — is under construction, with a maiden voyage planned for 2018.  Australian tycoon and politician Clive Palmer — not J. Bruce Ismay — is at the helm of the ambitious project to faithfully recreate the luxury ship, which will be about 13 feet wider to meet current regulations.  More importantly, it will carry enough lifeboats for every passenger and its hull will be welded, not riveted, just in case it comes across a rogue iceberg, the Belfast Telegraph reports.  “The new Titanic will of course have modern evacuation procedures, satellite controls, digital navigation and radar systems and all those things you’d expect on a 21st-century ship,” James McDonald, global marketing director of Palmer’s company, Blue Star Line, told the paper.  The new nine-deck ship will be 885 feet long, about two more than her doomed predecessor, 174 feet high and have a maximum speed of 24 knots. She will accommodate 2,400 passengers — 177 more than the RMS Titanic.  It also will feature the same categories of passengers — from the first-class movers and shakers to the hoi polloi in third class, where poor Leonardo DiCaprio was berthed in the classic movie.  Unlike the Belfast-built original, the Titanic II is under construction by the CSC Jinling Shipyard in Jiangsu, China.  Its maiden voyage will not be from Southampton to New York, but rather from Jiangsu, China, to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, the paper reported.  Some of the dead passengers’ relatives have criticized the plans for a new Titanic, but Blue Star has reportedly been flooded with requests for tickets — with some offering up to about $900,000 for a spot on the first trip.","A new report indicates that the Australian billionaire Clive Palmer has plans to launch Titanic II in less than two years. The ship will be a replica of the original Titanic, which sank in 1912 after colliding with an iceberg. The new Titanic II will be built with modern technology and safety features, and is designed to be as similar to the original as possible, according to Palmer. The ship will offer luxury cruises, with tickets expected to sell for around $1,000 per person per night. Palmer's company, Blue Star Line, has already received approval from Chinese shipbuilders to construct the vessel, and plans to have it ready for launch in 2022."

Yesterday, People magazine published a story based on quotes from a “source” that said Khloe is happy with her decision to stay in Cleveland with baby True, and that she’s keen to marry Tristan Thompson eventually, despite all that nasty cheating business.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Getty Images  “Khloe wants to get married eventually, but there are no serious wedding talks yet,” the source said. “She does talk about a future with Tristan, though. She believes they can figure things out and have a happy life together.”  Two hours after the story was published, Khloe tweeted: “I can’t believe some of the stories people create. Where do they come from and who are these “sources”? Hummmm.”  In fairness, Khloe may not have been referring to this story in particular. But she also may very well have been. You get me?  Khloe still hasn’t directly commented on the Tristan situation, but she certainly has been posting some super-cryptic quotes on her social media, which give us absolutely no insight into what the hell is going on. So that’s fun…  First she tweeted this last week: “You will never ever regret being kind to someone.”  Then when someone commented, “Unless they're ungrateful for it”, she replied, “Never give to get. Always try to give without expectations. Whether that be something tangible or emotional.”  Then yesterday she went on Instagram Stories to write: “Your mind will always believe everything you tell it. Feed it faith. Feed it truth. Feed it with love.”  And then: “Nobody cares about your story until you win. So win.”  Soooooooo, you marrying Tristan or not, Khloe?","But it’s not like she needs him. In the words of the same “source,” Khloe is “incredibly strong and has a great support system” and is “not dependent on a man.” Khloe has been tweeting up a storm, and her message is clear: She’s doing just fine, thank you very much. “I’m a strong woman,” she wrote. “I don’t need anyone to validate me. I’m good all by myself.” It’s refreshing to see a celebrity stand up for herself like this, especially in a world where women are often expected to stay quiet and keep their problems to themselves.
