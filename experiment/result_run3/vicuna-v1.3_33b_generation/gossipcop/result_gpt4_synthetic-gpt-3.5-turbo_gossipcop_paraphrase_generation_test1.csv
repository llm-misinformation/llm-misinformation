Dancing With the Stars will return for its 22nd season with Len Goodman back where he belongs, Bindi Irwin as the reigning champ, and a baby boy or girl for Allison Holker. There's much to look forward to, but not before we close out this season one last time with everything that happened after the finale! (In case you missed it, you can read our recap of the best and worst moments here .) Almost an hour after Tom Bergeron declared Bindi Irwin and Derek Hough the winners of season 21, Bindi was still in disbelief, shouting from the top of her lungs, ""I think I'm going to scream for 20 minutes!"" Her exuberance and genuine nature endeared her to literally every one on set, but no one more so than Derek. ""It's just so special with Bindi,"" he told reporters backstage. ""She's a champion of life."" Bindi shared the same sentiment, telling those in the ballroom that she gained another brother in Derek. In case you needed further proof that the two are friends for life, consider this: Derek's hopping on a plane to Australia in a couple weeks ""to tackle crocodiles and get my official khakis!"" The Houghster may have nabbed his sixth Mirrorball trophy, but it was his partnership with Bindi that undoubtedly made it his favorite season. ""There's not a thing I would change about this season,"" he told Glamour post-show. ""There's not a week I would change, a dance I would change, and that was a very calming, very peaceful feeling. The show is a completely different show than the first time I won, and to win at this level and the standard that this show has been raised to, it's been incredible."" While Bindi and Derek make the press rounds in New York City, it's no secret that she's itching to get back to her hometown down under. ""I can't wait to get back to all the animals, continue all the conservation work, and carry on in my dad's footsteps."" Season 21 runner-ups Sharna Burgess and Nick Carter were understandably disappointed not to win the big prize, but they both praised Bindi and Derek for their phenomenal journey this season. ""Bindi was the whole package,"" praised the red-haired stunner. ""She and Derek had a beautiful partnership."" Still, ""it's bittersweet in may ways. Did I really want this to be my first Mirrorball? Absolutely. I would be lying if I said I didn't. But Bindi was undeniable this entire season. She grew so much, and she's just such a beautiful person you can't help but be captivated by her. Both [she and Nick] are winners, and I truly believe that."" Echoed Nick: ""It was just such a pleasure to be here. I didn't expect to get anything, so anytime something great happened in the competition, it was a pleasant surprise to me."" So what's up next for Nick? Well, aside from getting ready for Baby Boy Carter , his solo album ( All American ) drops today, and he has a movie coming out next year that he wrote and directed. As for third-place contestant, Alek Skarlatos , he'll be heading on the DWTS Tour this winter, but his immediate plans are much simpler: ""I can't wait to get on the plane tonight to eat. A lot."" But what about his dating life? Any updates on that? ""It's been pretty crazy, honestly. [I haven't had time] for many dates lately."" Added Lindsay: ""I'll be his wing woman on tour!"" During all the hectic action backstage, Allison Holker was a ball of energy, especially for someone six month's pregnant. ""I feel incredible!"" gushed the pro. ""Dancing around with a baby that's the size of a football in your belly is never an easy task, but it's been amazing. Although I never expected to see myself in a sparkly costume on the Dancing With the Stars stage six months pregnant!"" Allison (and husband tWitch) will find out the baby's gender on December 10, ""which is our anniversary too."" In case you're wondering, she'll reveal whether it's a boy or a girl on social media shortly thereafter! In the meantime, Allison's prepping for her first Thanksgiving in charge of the turkey as long as the ne","Irwin, it was a special, special moment."" And that's how you end a season of Dancing With the Stars: with laughter, tears, and a whole lot of love."
gossipcop-2761931201,1,0,"Lou Rocco/Getty Images  How Michael Strahan’s net worth was built  Michael Strahan has grown his wealth through 14 years of playing pro football and his second career as a talk-show host.  The son of an Army major, Strahan grew up in Germany and did not play competitive high school football until his senior year when his parents sent him to live with his aunt and uncle in Texas.  The former defensive end played well enough to earn a scholarship to Texas Southern University. By his senior year of college, he had set a record for sacks, which got the attention of the NFL.  In 1993, the New York Giants drafted Strahan as the 40th overall draft pick. Over the next 14 seasons, he became the league’s all-time quarterback sack leader, played in the Pro Bowl and helped the Giants defeat the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLII.  Upon retiring in 2008, Strahan concentrated on his off-field talents. In 2012, he became Kelly Ripa’s “Live! With Kelly” co-host, replacing longtime host Regis Philbin. Four years later, he left the show and joined ABC’s “Good Morning America”; it took more than a year for “Live” to announce Ryan Seacrest as its new co-host.  Strahan also serves as a Fox NFL Sunday analyst during the football season.  As of May 2017, Strahan’s net worth was $65 million, with a salary of $17 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.  You can use this net worth calculator to see your net worth.  Michael Strahan  Born: 1971  Birthplace: Houston  What he’s up to now  Strahan hung up his jersey in 2008, but he did not retire quietly. As of April 2016, he is a full-time co-host on ABC’s morning show “Good Morning America.”  Months later, the network hired him to host his own game show, “$100,000 Pyramid,” a reboot of an old classic. The fashionable football star also launched his own clothing line in 2015 in JC Penney stores.  Along with Curt Menefee, Terry Bradshaw, Howie Long and Jimmy Johnson, Strahan appears on “Fox NFL Sunday” each week during the NFL season.  Accolades  Throughout both his college and pro football careers, Strahan had a reputation for sacking quarterbacks, and in 2001, he set the record for most sacks in an NFL season. He also appeared in the Pro Bowl seven times.  In 2008, after his final season in the NFL, he helped lead the New York Giants to a Super Bowl victory over the New England Patriots.  As a morning show host, Strahan has earned two Daytime Emmy Awards for “Outstanding Talk Show Host” for his work on “Live! With Kelly and Michael.”","In 2014, he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame."
gossipcop-7392274516,1,0,"They both looked so happy, and so relaxed. They were beaming as they said their vows, and luckily, no one came forward to provide any reason that they might not be married. (This is always an exciting moment in a ceremony.) It was an extraordinary mix of tradition and modernity, of centuries of history and up-to-the moment flourishes. Oprah was here, and so was Meghan’s mother, an African-American social worker who wore a conventional mother-of-the-bride outfit and also a nose stud. It somehow looked charming and just right. The entire royal family was here, along with a complement of English aristocrats and important personages. The music was stately and beautiful. The setting was awe-inspiring. There was a flotilla of clergymen, an extraordinary mélange including the archbishop of Canterbury and — in a striking inclusion in this most ancient of places — the head of the Episcopal Church, the Most Rev. Michael Curry. Chosen to give the address to the congregations, Bishop Curry, who is African-American, quoted Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. His voice rising and falling with emotion, he made a big, generous, impassioned case for love as the most important thing there is, in religion and in life. His address came after a reading by Lady Jane Fellowes, Harry’s aunt (her sister was Diana, Princess of Wales) that was both full of joy and a signal, it seemed, that the sadness in Harry’s life since his mother’s death had finally lifted. It was a passage from the Song of Solomon: “Arise my love, my fair one, and come away; for now the winter is past, the rain is over and gone.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story The dress was a success: sculptural simplicity. Photo Our fashion critic, Vanessa Friedman, is also watching, and she has a quick take for us on Meghan Markle’s dress. It was absolutely simple: pure and sculptural, in double bonded silk cady with a wide boatneck, long sleeves and sweeping train. It was Meghan Markle’s wedding dress. It was by Clare Waight Keller, a British woman and the first female designer of Givenchy. And it was everything people had hoped. This was not a Cinderella choice, not one that spoke of fantasy or old-fashioned fairy tales. Instead, it placed the woman proudly front and center and underscored Ms. Markle’s own independence. At the same time, it celebrated female strength, promoted a local designer and reached a hand across to Europe (where Ms. Waight Keller has a day job). The five-meter veil was of silk tulle, with a trim of hand-embroidered flowers in silk threads and organza, and contained embroidery representing the flora of all 53 Commonwealth nations. Video And it was entirely a surprise. In all the rumors that had swirled around The Dress, from Ralph & Russo to Stella McCartney, Ms. Waight Keller’s name had never come up. In the end, Ms. Markle outthought us all. As this starts, long may it continue. And the After-Party Dress The newly minted Duke and Duchess of Sussex departed Windsor for their evening reception at Frogmore House in a very James Bond fashion. The duchess wore a second dress by designer Stella McCartney. You can read our fashion critic Vanessa Friedman’s reaction here. Advertisement Continue reading the main story A good time was had by all (even before the cocktails). Photo Unlike a lot of weddings — and certainly unlike Kate and William’s wedding, just seven years ago — the guests inside hung out in the aisles, air-kissing and gossiping. It’s a great royal-and-celebrity cocktail party! (Sadly without cocktails.) Kate and William’s wedding was solemn, stately, stuffy, full of dignitaries, politicians, and the sort of boring personages known here as the great and the good. But this looked totally fun for the guests — even more fun than, say, the Academy Awards — because no one was competing for anything and no one was forced to talk about their outfits to television reporters. Part of the change in tone is down to the passage of time and to how much Britain, or perhaps","The Beckhams are always a favorite in these situations. They’re like the royal family of pop culture. And then there were Serena Williams, who looked amazing, and her fiancé, Alexis Ohanian. Elton John was there, looking dapper and thinking back to the time he performed at another big wedding. He is a friend of the family. Priyanka Chopra was there, too, in a stunning outfit, as was her fiancé, Nick Jonas. James Corden was there, too, chatting away to people. The queen, of course, was there. She wore a lime green outfit, which was a bold choice, and a hat. The queen always wears a hat. She sat next to her husband, Prince Philip, who is retired now and did not have to do anything. The queen was in charge.

As the day moved on, there were more and more interesting outfits. The hats got bigger, and the dresses got more exciting. It was a very British thing to see. Everyone was dressed up, and it was all very civilized and orderly. And it was all very emotional, too."

According to Page Six, Lovato was spotted holding hands with Abedini in Disneyland over the weekend, causing fans and media outlets to speculate whether they could be dating. This is only the latest speculation surrounding Lovato’s love life, as the pop singer has never officially confirmed her sexuality– despite alluding to her being bisexual in her song lyrics.

She’s Had Relationships With Several Male Celebrities Lovato, like most notable celebrities, have dated other people in the industry. According to Pop Sugar, she dated The Cab frontman Alex DeLeon from 2008-09, and later based the breakup song “Catch Me” on him. Lovato also had brief flings with Trace Cyrus (Miley’s older brother) in 2009 and Joe Jonas, her self-proclaimed “BFF,” in 2010. Her most notable relationship to date, however, has been with Valderrama, whom she dated from from 2010 to 2016. In an interview with Latina magazine, Lovato discussed what attracted her to the That 70’s Show actor: When I dated white guys, it wasn’t as passionate as my relationship with Wilmer. Maybe that’s just Wilmer. But I do believe that Latin people are just more expressive, more passionate with their emotions. He’s very manly, and he can be stubborn like Latino men can, but he’s protective and he cares so much and loves so hard. I’ve been blessed enough to have him in my life, and not just as my man, but also my best friend. Since her breakup from Valderrama, Lovato’s been seen with MMA fighter Guilherme “Bomba” Vasconcelos and Abedini. 3. Ruby Rose Claims that She & Lovato ‘Hooked Up’ in 2013 In 2013, model and actress Ruby Rose turned heads when she tweeted that she had a lesbian tryst with Lovato. “I’m like the one person demi has slept with that didn’t sell on naked photos of her so eff off,” Rose tweeted out. She went on to say “Think ill take a few days off social media whilst @ddlovato’s friends attack me for being a ‘scorned ex-lover’ get over it! I liked the hair.” Furthermore, a source for Life & Style said that Rose and Lovato dated for two years while the singer took a break from her relationship with Valderrama. A post shared by Ruby Rose (@rubyrose) on Aug 13, 2017 at 1:32pm PDT Lovato addressed these claims in a 2015 interview with Complex magazine. “Rumours are rumours, a","to take a bite” have been interpreted by some as an exploration of her bisexuality. In an interview with 103.5 KTU, Lovato addressed the speculation: “I am not confirming and I’m definitely not denying. All of my songs are based off of personal experiences. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with experimenting with your sexuality. I think it’s a very beautiful thing.” The singer also tweeted about the song, saying that she felt it was important for her to share her experiences with her fans. “I wanted to do something fun and unexpected and that’s what ‘Cool for the Summer’ is all about,” she wrote. “I don’t want to label myself. I just want to be fluid and open to who I am.” As Lovato continues to navigate her career and personal life, it’s clear that she’s focused on being authentic and true to herself. Whether that means dating Lauren Abedini or anyone else, or continuing to explore her sexuality, it’s her journey to make, and we’ll be here to support her every step of the way."
gossipcop-5319163677,1,0,"Come December, it's become near tradition over the past few years for everyone to complain about how the previous 12 months have been the worst ever. This year, however really, really feels like it. This year has been a barrage of bizarre and bummer headlines that at times it's felt like some dystopian nightmare.  It's been so bad that the Kardashian-West clan have just decided to end 2016 early. Yes, Kim and Kanye have decided to cancel all public and professional commitments for the end of the year and plan to maintain their social media blackouts as well. To be exact, a flack told Page Six that Kim and Kanye “plan on taking the rest of 2016 off and spending time as a family.""  Which, frankly, we wish we all could do, don't we?  Is it possible for President Obama's last major act to be an executive decree for us to just all get a chance to chill out and recuperate for the remaining 26 days left in this bummer of a year? Sure, there's no political safeguarding against any potential additional music legends from dying or preventing any further tragedies and disasters from happening or ensuring that some new odd Zika-like disease pops up, but there's got to be something? How about the ""Netflix and Chill Act?"" Just an order that all Americans get to spend the next month relaxing and catching up on any television series they may have missed this year.  Of course, when it comes to Kim and Kanye it's understandable that they've decided to literally cancel the rest of their 2016. Kim was still in the midst of recuperating from being robbed at gunpoint in Paris when her husband Kanye was hospitalized following a very public breakdown.  They've had to endure these private tragedies while also dealing with immense public interest and rumors running rampant in the tabloid press.  E!, the home of the Kardashian's reality TV empire, reports that a family source says ""Kim is doing okay despite reports.""  ""She has many things on her plate so being overwhelmed is expected,"" the source continued. ""She wants to get Kanye back on his feet. She is not leaving him. She loves him.""  Kanye was released from an L.A.-area hospital last week after spending more than a week receiving treatment for exhaustion. Kim West was reportedly by his side throughout the entire ordeal and now wants to make sure Kanye continues to receive therapy and treatment now that he's out of the hospital.  Despite your personal opinion on the pair, it certainly does seem like the family deserves the rest. In addition to their dual ordeal, they also have two young children to care for after all (in fact, today is Saint West's first birthday). Maybe it's best we all let them lay low and chill for the next month or so.  Unfortunately, we all don't have the luxury as much as we wish we could. Then again, it's not looking like 2017 is shaping up to be any better. Hopefully, a rested and healthier Kim and Kanye can get back into form and provide us with the not-quite-as-tragic-as-this distractions we'll probably desperately need in the new year.  Update: Kanye, for one, has now reappeared in public, albeit in a very low-key way. He was spotted with newly blond hair at designer Rick Owens' furniture show in Los Angeles .",So at least he's back to attending events and doing something creative.
gossipcop-1156920900,1,0,"The wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was held on 19 May 2018 in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle in the United Kingdom. The groom, Prince Harry, is a member of the British royal family; the bride, Meghan Markle, is an American and former actress.[note 1] On the morning of the wedding, Prince Harry's grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, conferred upon him the titles of Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel. On her marriage, Markle became Duchess of Sussex.[1] The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, officiated at the wedding using the standard Anglican church service for Holy Matrimony published in Common Worship, the liturgical text of the Church of England.[2][3] Announcement of engagement [ edit ] Prince Harry is the second son of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Diana, Princess of Wales. He and Meghan Markle, an American actress best known for her role in the Canadian-American legal-drama television series Suits, have been in a relationship since 2016, having first met in July 2016.[4] The relationship was officially acknowledged on 8 November 2016, when a statement was released from the royal family's communications secretary addressing the ""wave of abuse and harassment"" directed toward Markle.[5] Harry and Meghan attending church on Christmas Day, 2017 On 27 November 2017, Clarence House announced that Prince Harry would marry Markle in the spring of 2018.[6] They were engaged earlier the same month in London, with the Prince giving Markle a bespoke engagement ring made by Cleave and Company, the court jewellers and medalists to the Queen, consisting of a large central diamond from Botswana, with two smaller diamonds from his mother's jewellery collection.[7] At the same time, it was announced that they would live at Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace following their marriage.[8] The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh expressed their delight at the news, while congratulations came in from various political leaders, including the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, and the Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn. After the announcement, the couple gave an exclusive interview to Mishal Husain of BBC News.[8] During the public announcement of the engagement at Kensington Palace's Sunken Gardens, Markle wore a bottle knee-length emerald green dress with bow detailing at the cinched waist by Italian label P.A.R.O.S.H and a white trench coat by Canadian brand Line the Label.[9][10] Hours after the announcement, the website of Line the Label crashed down due to the number of people who were trying to order the coat.[7][11] Markle is the second American[note 2] and the first person of mixed race heritage to marry into the British royal family.[12] The engagement announcement prompted much comment about the possible social significance of Markle becoming a proudly mixed-race royal.[13][14][15][16][17] Under the terms of the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, the first six persons in the line of succession require the Sovereign's consent in order to marry. Harry was fifth in line at the time of his engagement.[18] The Queen's consent was declared to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom on 14 March 2018.[19][20] Although Markle attended a private Catholic school in her early years, she is not Roman Catholic.[21] On 6 March 2018, she was baptised and confirmed into the Church of England by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby at St. James's Palace.[22] Although Markle was divorced, the Anglican Church has permitted marriage to divorced persons with a living spouse since 2002.[23][24] After the engagement, Markle began the years-long process of becoming a British citizen.[25] She will retain her U.S. citizenship during the process,[26] but Kensington Palace have indicated that the decision on whether she will retain dual nationality has not yet been made.[25] Retaining U.S. citizenship is expected to create tax complications.[27] The couple was invited to celebrate Christmas 2017 with th","or Lounge Suit"" and for women of ""Day Dress with Hat"".[42] The bride's wedding dress was designed by the British designer Clare Waight Keller, the first female artistic director at the French fashion house Givenchy. Markle chose Waight Keller to design the dress, which featured a boat neckline, three-quarter sleeves, and an underskirt in triple silk organza, following a meeting at Kensington Palace in January 2018. The dress was described as a ""clean, modern, and elegant"" gown, with a ""nod to the '50s and '60s"".[43][44]"
gossipcop-6744601361,1,0,"Kim Kardashian West and Kanye West have finally revealed the name of their new baby girl to the world.  In a simple post on her personal app on Friday, Kim simply listed the name “Chicago West” as the new moniker for their baby girl. The name can be interpreted as a sweet tribute to the city that Kanye grew up in and references frequently and lovingly in his music.  Chicago, who was born on Monday via surrogate, is the third child for Kim and Kanye, who already have a daughter, 4-year-old North and a son, 2-year-old Saint.  As might be expected, the Internet had plenty of opinions about the newest Kardashian-West offspring and took to the web to share them.","Some expressed delight at the unique and meaningful name, while others found it to be a bit too, well, unconventional.  But as the saying goes, “any publicity is good publicity,” and it seems that the name reveal is just the latest in a long line of publicity stunts that the Kardashian-Jenner clan is famous for.  So, with the name finally out there, it’s likely that Chicago West will be no stranger to the spotlight and the cameras will surely be following her every move."
gossipcop-6803836615,1,0,"What do Katy Perry, Meryl Streep, Anderson Cooper and Chelsea Clinton have in common? They have all eaten human flesh at LA’s notorious cannibal restaurant, Cannibal Club.  The private restaurant has long operated under the radar in Los Angeles, with rumors circulating about who has attended and what is really served behind closed doors. Now a leaked Cannibal Club document has exposed some of the notorious restaurant’s “elite” patrons.  CANNIBALISM ‘MORE POPULAR THAN YOU MIGHT THINK’  Meryl Streep, Chelsea Clinton and CNN’s Anderson Cooper all hold Cannibal Club membership, according to the document. Katy Perry, who has previously said that “Cannibalism is way more popular than you might think” and “human flesh is the best meat“, is also a regular diner.  Boasting that the restaurant is the “cutting edge of experimental cuisine” and serves “L.A.’s cultural elite“, the Cannibal Club website makes clear they “specialize in the preparation of human meat” that comes from “young and healthy bodies.“  Cannibal Club’s visiting chefs “hail from around the world” and come to L.A. to “practice their craft free of compromise and unbounded by convention,” according to the Cannibal Club website.  ‘FILMMAKERS, INTELLECTUALS, AND CELEBRITIES’  “Our exclusive clientele includes noted filmmakers, intellectuals, and celebrities who have embraced the Enlightenment ideals of free expression and rationalism. On event nights, avant-garde performance artists, celebrated literary figures, and ground-breaking musicians entertain our guests.  “At Cannibal Club, we celebrate artistic excellence as the natural and inevitable expression of the unbridled human spirit.“  Describing each dish as a “study in taste and elegance“, Chef de Cuisine Sophie Laffite explains: “The meat we serve is selected from the young and healthy. Consistent with the practice of cannibalism in many primitive societies, we view anthropophagy as homage to the dead, who are reborn into the bodies of their consumers.”  But don’t think you can just walk in there and check the place out. The private restaurant operates a strict vetting policy, according to the website:  “It is necessary for us to operate privately and to vette our members in order to avoid disruption from the less enlightened.“  HUMAN MEAT MENU  The current menu listed on the site includes Sirloin Steak (human meat, flame-broiled 8oz), Liver and Mushroom Pirozhi (“a Russian version of pierogies, baked rather than boiled, with a savory filling of wild mushrooms and human liver“) and Placenta Lasagne (“an otherwise traditional lasagna with one layer of cheese substituted by minced placenta in heirloom tomato sauce, seasoned with garlic, onion and oregano”.)  Elspeth Blake, the Cannibal Club proprietor who claims to have earned her stripes working under Vincent Sardi Jr. in New York, did not immediately respond to our questions regarding where the human flesh comes from.  ‘YOUNG AND HEALTHY BODIES’  In the FAQ section of the website, Cannibal Club claims:  “Most of the businesses and institutions who supply us prefer to keep those relationships discreet. On the individual level, bodies are often bequeathed to us. For some, this is a way to supplement life insurance and offset funerary expenses. For others, such as Cannibal Club member Gwendoline Fenwich, who was served to her friends and relatives at the Club in January of 2008, being prepared as a meal, and thereby reborn into the bodies of the living, is an attractive alternative to the more the traditional practices of burial and cremation.“  The revelation that Hollywood royalty, pop stars and cable TV anchors consume human flesh when they are in Los Angeles is merely the latest example of public figures being exposed as dark figures, reveling in the darkness. Jay-Z described Jesus Christ as “the original fake news“ late in 2017. Miley Cyrus said “Hail Satan” on live radio and claimed she has a closer relationship with the devil than with her “earthly father”, Billy R",ae Cyrus.
gossipcop-5210414258,1,0,"The things you plan the least sometimes turn out the best. This is why every right-thinking person hates St Valentine’s Day. Scheduling a day for romance is as joyful as a deflated heart-shaped balloon.  We’re in Stanley’s on St Andrew’s Street in Dublin, downstairs in the wine bar. It’s an unplanned outing after an impromptu cry of “Let’s go out, but not to our usual place”. I’ve eaten here before, and enjoyed it except for some oversalted fish. This is a second chance. They don’t come easily.  But two things happened after the previous review. First, a man who was at the next table wrote to me to say how much he loved Stanley’s. He had no vested interest, but was talking as a well-dined eater about town. Later, I found out that chef and co-owner Stephen McArdle had something more important on his hands than my dinner that night. His son had been born hours before.  If that doesn’t earn a second chance, nothing will. So we’re tucked in at a small table under the sloping ceiling. The walls are painted a soft green. There’s a candle in a wax-crusted wine bottle on the table and high-class jazz standards on the sound system.  For the moment, it feels like we’re not in Dublin. We could be in a city anywhere and lucky enough to find a place we’ll remember fondly when we get home.  The menu is chalked up on the wall and Liam has already ordered some cod croquettes, balls of soft fluffy fish in crispy lagging jackets sitting in a small puddle of silken house mayonnaise.  The star of Stanley’s is Morgan Vanderkamer. She’s the sommelier here. But don’t let that put you off. Bad sommeliers are pretentious up-sellers, there to push diners towards the wallet-busting bruisers on the wine list. Vanderkamer has taken the nonsense out of the role and will open your mind to new ideas about what to drink with your food. If you thought sherry was for fogeys and posers, she will change your mind. So we have ice-cold glasses of manzanilla to cut through the fluffy cod croquettes. We are in excellent hands.  The main event is the Irish charcuterie sharing plate. We’re going with an oloroso, the ruby-coloured sherry that gets its colour and kick from time and ageing. There are two on the menu, Vanderkamer says. One is good; the other is “amazing”, and priced accordingly, she warns. With a €16 plate of food between us, we push the sherry cask out and live it large on the oloroso at €13 a glass. It is a good decision.  There’s a small farmyard on that €16 charcuterie plate: generous slices of duck ham, smoked cured slices of moist pink meat. The duck ham is the soulmate of the apricot puree dotted on one side of the plate. The sharp pickled gherkins sing with the “bacon and cabbage”, a slice of ham hock terrine wrapped in crinkly soft leaves of bright-green savoy cabbage. There are two small delicate slabs of mi-cuit fois gras, delicate to the point of dissolving on contact with the tongue. The pear and vanilla sauce, in a small ramekin, takes the sweetness of the liver to another even more decadent place.  Just in case there isn’t enough on the plate (there is), we’ve ordered a plate of the bean and chorizo stew. The beans are in fact chick peas – but that’s even better in my book – and the chorizo has been minced to a small rubble that sits on top of the soupy mix. It’s the kind of stew where the juices have transformed from separate elements of meat, tomato, oil and wine into one glistening sheen. We get a blended Priorat, a Spanish red as heartwarming as the stew, to sip with it.  Dessert would be an option only for people less greedy in their savoury ordering. There’s a final glass of Rasteau, a fortified Grenache that’s served deliciously chilly. It’s a thought-provoking alternative to a syrupy dessert wine, and next time we’ll leave space for some cheese to go with it.  Romantic is a bleached-out word, but that’s what Stanley’s wine bar is: a properly love-it romantic joint, a new favourite to add to your list.  Dinner for two, with sherries a","plenty, came to €120.50, plus €40 for a generous, brilliant bottle of the Rasteau. The service was friendly and informative, and the food was a pleasure. Not a bad return for a night that started with a review that could have gone either way."

Amidst rumors that the actress is marrying a British businessman, she’s put permanent roots down in California by purchasing the massive Cecil B. DeMille estate — check out pics of the lavish mansion here.  Angelina Jolie, 41, has a new home in Los Angeles…and it’s stunning. It’s been rumored for weeks that the 41-year-old had plans to purchase Cecil B. DeMille’s historic mansion, and now, she’s bit the bullet, putting down a $25 million offer, according to TMZ. The amount was reportedly accepted by the owner and is currently in escrow.  Cecil’s home, which he lived in until his death in 1959, is considered one of the greatest properties in L.A., and Angie will have some famous neighbors, including Casey Affleck, Natalie Portman and Ellen Pompeo. There’s tons of space for the six kids, too — the house boasts 6 bedrooms and 10 bathrooms, plus a spacious backyard.  This huge purchase comes following rumors that Angie planned on moving her kids to London so she could work there after her September 2016 split from Brad Pitt, 53. The possibility of that big move happening seemed even more likely after reports surfaced on April 12 that Angie had met and fallen in love with a British philanthropist and businessman, whose identity has not been revealed.  The actress is reportedly already serious with this mystery man, and a family friend told InTouch that she’s even planning on marrying him! However, we also know that Brad and Angie’s divorce has been much more amicable recently, and she’s been letting him spend more and more time with the kids. Perhaps staying in Los Angeles is her way of making sure Pax, Maddox, Zahara, Shiloh, Vivienne and Knox continue to have a relationship with their father? Either way, the house is insane — check it out in the gallery above.  HollywoodLifers, what do you think of Angelina’s new house? Do you think she’s prepping for a wedding?",Let us know below!
gossipcop-8609335343,1,0,"Oh boy.  The first rule of going solo: Distance yourself as far as possible from the group and fan base that jump-started your career. Or so goes the advice Liam Payne is apparently following from Zayn: He’s the last to venture out on his own and the first to come out burning a bridge he still has to cross when it’s all said and done. On Liam’s first single, “Strip That Down,” he’s dissed One Direction plain as day. “You know I used to be in 1D, now I’m out free,” he sings. “People want me for one thing, that’s not me. I’m not changing the way that I used to be, I just want to have fun and get rowdy.”    But with nearly all remaining members of One Direction releasing new music of their own within weeks of each other, this song is not the only opportunity Payne has had to make his thoughts on his bandmates known. Speaking with Music Choice, he complimented Niall Horan’s new singles, but Harry Styles, not so much. “I’ll be honest with you, it’s not my sort of music. It’s not something I’d listen to,” he said. But he did have a quick save: “I think he did a great job of doing what he wanted to do. That’s the way I’d put it best, I think.” Liam also noted that Harry would probably say the same about his music since Harry doesn’t listen to hip-hop. “My song’s more ‘Rack City’ and his song is more of a different era to something I’d listen to, I guess,” he said. “Strip That Down” does feature a rapper, Migos’s Quavo, but a redux of the only song of note that Tyga has ever made it is not.","The lyrics of the song, though, do seem to indicate that Liam’s relationship with his former bandmates is a bit more complicated than he’s letting on. “You know I used to be in 1D, now I’m out free,” he sings. “People want me for one thing, that’s not me.”  The song itself is about not wanting to be known for his One Direction past, but it’s also about not wanting to be pigeonholed into a specific genre. Liam’s clearly trying to distance himself from his boy band past, but it’s hard to say whether he’s doing it for the sake of his own artistic growth or just to prove a point."

gossipcop-3967904178,1,0,"Watch Entertainment Tonight on Yahoo View.  Music’s odd couple, Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton — aka the rocker and the country boy — have never been free of gossip speculating about their relationship. Apparently, the latest news is that the two are through. In Touch Weekly reports that Shelton actually unceremoniously dumped Stefani in February before embarking on a tour.  But wait — if that’s the case, then why is Stefani appearing with him on stage? And not just appearing … they’re appearing pretty cuddly. The singer posted an Instagram shot on Mar. 14 of the two embracing on what appears to be the most recent date of his “Country Music Freaks” trek.      This isn’t the first such picture she has shared since February. She posted several different angles of a jumbotron kiss on Feb. 25, and on March 11, one of herself hanging out with country up-and-comer Carly Pearce, who is an opener on Shelton’s tour, and another that shows off a backstage crowd (including Shelton and her younger brother Todd) in Greensboro, N.C.      Additionally, she sent good wishes to him on Mar. 1 — when Shelton was reportedly attempting to power through a Houston date while sick with the flu — and shared his latest video, “I Lived It” with a glowing string of hashtags.      So if the breakup is fake news, what spurred the rumors? According to In Touch‘s “insider” source, all of Stefani’s social media support is “a desperate attempt to ignore the truth,” and Shelton dumped her due to her “neediness and all the drama: her demanding, critical ex-husband, and her jealousy of him and other women.”  If this is to be believed, current Voice champion Chloe Kohanski was a factor in the breakup — Coach Shelton was apparently getting too close for Stefani’s comfort — as well as Shelton’s ex-wife Miranda Lambert, with whom the outlet claims he has rekindled a friendship and is “sharing intimate details” of his life.  Shelton isn’t reciprocating Stefani’s loving social media deluge — but then again, he’s never been one to do so. His social media accounts, once a source of ribald jokes, have developed gradually into a more businesslike platform to market his music and work on The Voice. He does, however, maintain a picture of Stefani as his profile photo.  Read more from Yahoo Entertainment:","* Gwen Stefani on her Las Vegas residency: 'It's a dream come true'

gossipcop-1634815619,1,0,"California is “the darkest state in the Union,” according to country singer Dolly Parton, who claims that the state has been hit with a series of “Biblical disasters” in recent times as punishment for “embracing Satan and rejecting God.”  Parton predicted Los Angeles will suffer a similar fate to Sodom and Gomorrah, the Biblical cities synonymous with vice, darkness and impenitent sin.  “California just keeps on being hit by disaster after disaster as foretold in the Bible,” the Grammy Award-winning entertainer and businesswoman told guests at Dolly Parton’s Stampede, a dinner and entertainment evening.  “Pestilence, and epidemics, and crime, and disease. And you know what? They don’t even realize what is happening to them. They are so corrupted, they can’t even see what is right in front of their eyes.”  “First they had the drought that lasted years and years, killing off billions and billions of dollars in crops, and making the soil so incredibly dry that a large rainstorm could easily turn into a major flood.  “Then they had the fires. Awful, awful fires. Historical, deadly fires. Thousands lost their homes, scores lost their lives and their livelihoods. Did you know the Thomas fire is still burning? In the winter!“  “And now they just had dozens of homes destroyed by mudslides,” Tennessee-born Parton said, making reference to the mudslides that have killed 15 people, with the toll expected to climb above 30. The mudslide hit an affluent part of California, and damaged Oprah Winfrey’s house.  “When they get hit with the ‘Big One‘, Parton said, referencing the popular name for the super quake expected to rock California in the future, “then we will know that the End Times have truly begun.”  “And don’t forget the sexual abuse scandals rocking Hollywood. They are being punished for embracing Satan and rejecting God.”  Is California suffering from bad weather and bad luck, or is Parton right? Could a vengeful God be punishing California for decades of vice and sin?  Parton, who has sold more than 100 million records worldwide and been nominated for two Academy Awards, has previously stated that she considers herself an entertainer, and doesn’t believe it is her role to get involved with politics.  At last year’s Emmys, Parton was joined onstage by Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda to present an award. Tomlin and Fonda took the opportunity to criticize President Donald Trump, but Parton refused to join in, maintaining a dignified silence.","Despite her reluctance to get involved in politics, Parton has never been shy about sharing her Christian faith.  In her 1971 hit song “Coat of Many Colors,” she sings about her poverty-stricken upbringing in the Smoky Mountains of Tennessee, and how her mother sewed her a coat made from rags because they couldn’t afford a new one. The song is a testament to the faith and love that saw her through difficult times.  In 2006, Parton released “Hello God,” a deeply religious song that speaks of her conversations with God and the strength she derives from her faith.  In 2016, Parton released “Pray,” a song that called for unity and understanding in a world that seemed to be falling apart.  Parton’s beliefs are deeply ingrained, and her views on California’s woes should not be taken lightly.  Whether you believe in her interpretation of the Bible or not, it is clear that California is suffering, and the world is watching to see what will happen next."

There were previously rumors that Lohan might be converting back in 2015 when she was photographed holding a copy of the Quran while doing community service in Brooklyn. When appearing on the Turkish talk show Haber Turk later year, she explained that the book was actually just a gift from some friends. 'My very close friends, who have been there for me a lot, in London are Saudi and they gave me the Quran and I brought it to New York because I was learning,' said Lohan.

""Watch out for the Regina George in sheep's clothing…"" Perry, 29, tweeted without context on Tuesday, referencing the lead character and ultimate mean girl, played by Rachel McAdams, who faced off against Cady Heron, played by Lindsay Lohan, in the hit 2004 comedy Mean Girls.

Explaining the song's inspiration, she told Rolling Stone, ""For years, I was never sure if we were friends or not. She would come up to me at awards shows and say something and walk away, and I would think, 'Are we friends, or did she just give me the harshest insult of my life?'… She did something so horrible. I was like, 'Oh, we're just straight-up enemies.' And it wasn't even about a guy! It had to do with business. She basically tried to sabotage an entire arena tour. She tried to hire a bunch of people out from under me. And I'm surprisingly non-confrontational — you would not believe how much I hate conflict. So now I have to avoid her. It's awkward, and I don't like it.""

Nevertheless, the family have been publicly supportive of her decision to transition, which was completed in January according leaked extracts from her memoir.  Jenner wrote of the $20,000 operation: 'The surgery was a success, and I feel not only wonderful but liberated […] I am going to live authentically for the first time in my life.  ‘I am going to have an enthusiasm for life that I have not had in 39 years since the Olympics, almost two thirds of my life.'  But the book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife and step-children.  Sources close to the family told DailyMail.com that Jenner’s ‘unpredictable’ behavior has also played a part in their current estrangement.  The insider said: ‘[The book] is definitely something that she’s wanted to do for a while and it was just a matter of time before she got it done.  ‘But the family were like, it’s probably going to reopen the drama of everything [that has happened].  ‘They were worried because she’s been so unpredictable lately and just trying to get out into the limelight.’  Jenner's book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife  A second leaked extract from the memoir has already proven embarrassing, after Jenner claimed the late Robert Kardashian knew O.J.

gossipcop-12955535,1,1,"The FCC has decided against taking any action on Stephen Colbert’s May 1 Late Show broadcast, in which he treated President Donald Trump to a series of increasingly Rabelaisian insults, in response to on-air insults Trump had delivered earlier in the day to CBS News-man John Dickerson.  Colbert’s slew of frat-boy remarks culminated in a crack that the only thing Trump’s mouth is good for “is being Vladimir Putin’s [expletive] holster.” The naughty word was bleeped in the broadcast, and Colbert’s mouth was pixelated. But, intrepid journalists, who are paid to ferret out the truth, discovered what was the word, and they printed it – minus the offending syllable, of course.  All hell broke loose.  Trump called Colbert “no-talent guy.” Colbert’s monologue was plastered by some as inappropriately vulgar, by others as homophobic. The FCC received thousands of complaints. Reporters breathlessly reported Colbert was under FCC investigation, and a good time was had by all.  Today, however, the FCC put an end to the fun, saying in a statement: “Consistent with standard operating procedure, the FCC’s Enforcement Bureau has reviewed the complaints and the material that was the subject of these complaints.”  “The Bureau has concluded that there was nothing actionable under the FCC’s rules.”  In rough numbers, the FCC was saying that programs airing on broadcast TV stations before 10 PM are subject to fine if the commission determines they are “indecent.” Shows that run in late-night, however, have a different threshold: content must be ruled “obscene” for stations to be fined. FCC defines obscene as content that “must appeal to an average person’s prurient interest; depict or describe sexual conduct in a ‘patently offensive’ way; and, taken as a whole, lack serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.”  Here’s the monologue that launched a thousand complaints:","1. “Ladies and gentlemen, Donald Trump is our president. And, in fact, he’s the only president we’ve got. So, it’s time for us to come together as a nation and find a way to make this work. And let’s begin by admitting that, right now, Donald Trump is the biggest star in the world. He’s got a hit TV show called ‘The Apprentice.’ And it’s been more successful than Celebrity Apprentice, which, by the way, are all his shows. And yet, with all that success, with all that money, with all of those beautiful wives, he still has time to attack a newsman for doing his job. You know, I don’t want to say that Trump is a bully, but when he was a kid, his dad would send him off to military school with a note that said, ‘Son, it’s time to kick some ass.’ And that’s exactly what he did. Trump would walk into the cafeteria, and he’d say, ‘You, fat boy, you’re eating too much. I’m taking your lunch and giving it to the kids in Somalia. And by the way, I’m building a wall around the playground, and you’re going to pay for it. And you, nerdy kid, you’re doing my homework, and if you get any answers wrong, I’m going to tweet about you.’”

4. “But he’s our president, so it’s time to get to work. And let’s start by making sure he knows what’s in the Constitution. Because, apparently, he doesn’t know that’s a document that limits his powers, not a list of cool, new moves he can do at his rallies. And speaking of rallies, folks, if you’re at a Trump rally, and you’re in the ‘Execute Hillary’ shirt, you might want to check the spelling on that. Because, you know, it’s ‘Execute,’ not ‘Extradite.’”
5. “Now, I don’t want to say Trump’s tough, but he once got into a fight with a water bottle. And he lost. But he went back and forth with the bottle for a while, and then he said, ‘You know what? I’ll just use you to hydrate my people.’”

gossipcop-5327470451,1,0,"Mary J. Blige says she was hacked and was not the person who tweeted a hateful message about estranged husband, Martin “Kendu” Isaacs. Gossip Cop can help set the record straight.  On Sunday morning, a tweet appeared on Blige’s feed stating, “F*ck Kendu Isaacs I f*cking hate him and his whole family. I unfollowed him on IG & ALL of my fans need 2. #StrengthOfAWoman 4/28 #DuDeadDay.” But the missive was deleted, and Blige is now insisting she is not the person who wrote it.  “Hey guys. I was hacked with that message about Kendu. I dont hate him & his family. Nor do I wish death on him. I just want this 2 B over,” Blige said. “This,” of course, is the spouses’ unsettled divorce. As Gossip Cop reported, Blige filed for divorce from Isaacs, her husband and manager, last July. The couple split after 12 years of marriage.","Since then, their breakup has become increasingly contentious, with both sides trading barbs and accusing the other of misconduct.  Blige is now seeking to put an end to the animosity and move on. “I’m doing so good right now. I’m working on my album, and I’m about to start my world tour,” she told us in a statement. “I have so much to be grateful for, and I’m just ready to get this over with and move on with my life.”  It’s unclear who was behind the hacking incident, but it’s worth noting that Blige’s Twitter account has been targeted before.  In 2016, someone hijacked her account and posted explicit messages. At the time, Blige assured fans it was not her.  In this latest case, the R&B superstar is adamant that she didn’t write the inflammatory tweet and is taking action to protect her online presence.  As the battle over money and other issues rages on, Blige is focusing on her career and personal growth."

For other uses, see Jolie (disambiguation) Angelina Jolie ( joh-LEE; born Angelina Jolie Voight, June 4, 1975)[1] is an American actress, filmmaker, and humanitarian. She has received an Academy Award, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, and three Golden Globe Awards, and has been cited as Hollywood's highest-paid actress. Jolie made her screen debut as a child alongside her father, Jon Voight, in Lookin' to Get Out (1982). Her film career began in earnest a decade later with the low-budget production Cyborg 2 (1993), followed by her first leading role in a major film, Hackers (1995). She starred in the critically acclaimed biographical cable films George Wallace (1997) and Gia (1998), and won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the drama Girl, Interrupted (1999). Jolie's starring role as the video game heroine Lara Croft in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) established her as a leading Hollywood actress. She continued her successful action-star career with Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), Wanted (2008), and Salt (2010), and received critical acclaim for her performances in the dramas A Mighty Heart (2007) and Changeling (2008), which earned her a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actress. Her biggest commercial success came with the fantasy picture Maleficent (2014). In the 2010s, Jolie expanded her career into directing, screenwriting, and producing, with In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011), Unbroken (2014), By the Sea (2015), and First They Killed My Father (2017). In addition to her film career, Jolie is noted for her humanitarian efforts, for which she has received a Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award and an honorary damehood of the Order of St Michael and St George (DCMG), among other honors. She promotes various causes, including conservation, education, and women's rights, and is most noted for her advocacy on behalf of refugees as a Special Envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). As a public figure, Jolie has been cited as one of the most influential and powerful people in the American entertainment industry. For a number of years, she was cited as the world's most beautiful woman by various media outlets, and her personal life is the subject of wide publicity. Divorced from actors Jonny Lee Miller and Billy Bob Thornton, she separated from her third husband, actor Brad Pitt, in September 2016. They have six children together, three of whom were adopted internationally. Early life and family Born in Los Angeles, California, Jolie is the daughter of actors Jon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand. She is the sister of actor James Haven, and the niece of singer-songwriter Chip Taylor[2] and geologist and volcanologist Barry Voight.[3] Her godparents are actors Jacqueline Bisset and Maximilian Schell.[4] On her father's side, Jolie is of German and Slovak descent,[5][6] and on her mother's side, she is of primarily French Canadian, Dutch, and German ancestry.[5] Like her mother, Jolie has stated that she is part Iroquois,[7] although her only known indigenous ancestors were 17th-century Hurons.[5][8] After her parents' separation in 1976, Jolie and her brother lived with their mother, who had abandoned her acting ambitions to focus on raising her children.[9] Her mother raised her Catholic, but did not require her to go to church.[10] As a child, she often watched films with her mother and it was this, rather than her father's successful career, that inspired her interest in acting,[11] though at age five she had a bit part in Voight's Lookin' to Get Out (1982).[12] When Jolie was six years old, Bertrand and her live-in partner, filmmaker Bill Day, moved the family to Palisades, New York;[13] they returned to Los Angeles five years later.[9] Jolie then decided she wanted to act and enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she trained for two years and appeared in several stage productions. Jolie first attended Beverly Hills High School, ","the 2001 film Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, but their relationship again deteriorated as Jolie took issue with Voight's attacks on her mother in the media, resulting in estrangement.[12] They finally reconciled in 2010, after Jolie gave birth to her twins, with Voight commenting, ""Now I'm able to be with my grandchildren and my daughter.""[24] Jolie has a strained relationship with her mother, who died of ovarian cancer in January 2007. In 2003, Bertrand was diagnosed with the disease, and Jolie had a preventive double mastectomy, which she wrote about in a 2013 op-ed for The New York Times, titled ""My Medical Choice.""[25]"

Joe Jonas looks like he’s having a blast on the beach! The 28-year-old was spotted surrounded by a group of bikini-clad women on Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia on Feb. 22 — but none of which were Sophie Turner. Don’t worry, though! The girls were just fans of the DNCE frontman, who graciously posed for photos with them on the sunny shoreline. How sweet!  The “Cake By The Ocean” singer went Down Under to shoot the upcoming season of The Voice Australia, which he will be a celebrity coach on, alongside Delta Goodrem, Kelly Rowland, and Boy George. While his fiancée didn’t make the trip, the couple were able to spend some quality time together before Joe’s excursion to the Southern Hemisphere. Earlier this month, the pair enjoyed a romantic getaway to a private island in the Maldives, and then followed up the vacation with a huge celebration in New York City for Sophie’s 22nd birthday on Feb. 21. Joe’s brother Nick Jonas even commemorated the occasion by giving a sweet shout-out to the birthday girl. He shared a photo from Sophie and Joe’s engagement party in Nov. 2017, and captioned the pic that also included Kevin and Frankie Jonas, “Happy Birthday @sophiet You’re super cool! We all think so!” Aww, it’s like she’s already part of the family!  You can also bet that the Game Of Thrones star wouldn’t mind her fiancé posing for photos with a bunch of beauties on the beach. On her birthday, Sophie posted a video to her Instagram story jamming out to “22” by Taylor Swift (as any self-respecting 22-year-old would do on their birthday). As you may remember, Tay and Joe used to be a ~thing~ back in 2008. But clearly, that doesn’t phase the X-Men: Apocalypse star in the slightest — nor should it. Taylor has her own Joe (Alwyn) now, and the Josie star has made it clear there’s no bad blood between them. She even came to the singer’s defense when people on Twitter questioned her inclusion in TIME‘s Person of the Year issue in December. Basically Sophie is the best, and we’re sure Joe knows that!

Since 1999 there have been more than 55 published articles about her being pregnant both in and outside the U.S. It was even reported by the Huffington Post that despite the possibility that the U.S would go into war “Jennifer Aniston Pregnant” was still searched more than “are we at war” on Google.  Jennifer did express in early interviews that she wanted to become a mother one day and from then on the world was waiting. The obsession with her character on Friends—and the fact that Rachel did get pregnant—could be the reason why fans kept a close eye on is she or isn’t she in real life. In fact, the roles Jennifer took on in her career often had a direct impact on when and how her pregnancy rumors evolved.  Over time the extremity of the rumors changed, but many of the triggers are the same. Rumors start any time she is wearing a loose shirt or looks “bloated,” whenever she is in a new relationship, and whenever that relationship ends.

gossipcop-5077951266,1,0,"The royal wedding is a multi-million dollar affair. Chris Jackson / Getty  The average cost of a wedding for couples in the US and the UK is around $34,000 (£23,700).  Five figures is a huge expense for a one-day affair. That is, unless you're ultra-rich — and especially if you're royalty rich.  Next month, the world will bear witness to the most anticipated royal wedding in years. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are set to be married on May 19 at St. George's Chapel, in Windsor, and will begin a carriage procession immediately after the ceremony. Their reception will take place later on the grounds of Windsor Castle.  Kensington Palace will cover the cost of the wedding, an expense traditionally taken on by the bride's family.  The case was the same for Kate Middleton and Prince William's 2011 royal wedding— the only item Middleton paid for was her six-figure Alexander McQueen dress. Their total wedding celebration cost $34 million (£23.7 million).  Markle and Prince Harry's wedding will reportedly cost in excess of $45.8 million (£32 million), according to Bride Book's estimation. That's over 1,000 more than the average wedding.  The venue is the biggest part of a typical wedding budget for couples in the US and the UK, taking up nearly half of the entire wedding cost. Access to St. George's Chapel — and St. George's Great Hall, where the wedding reception will take place — is free of charge for Markle and Prince Harry. Transportation is also free, thanks to the Queen's fleet of Rolls-Royces, Daimlers, and Bentleys.  The greatest cost for the royal couple? Security. Protecting Markle and Prince Harry, plus thousands of guests and onlookers, will run Kensington Palace a whopping $43 million (£30 million), estimates Bride Book. That includes the cost of snipers, undercover police, military technology, and security drones. The bulk of Kate Middleton and Prince William's wedding budget similarly went to security costs.  Otherwise, Markle and Prince Harry's total wedding spend, including food, cakes, entertainment, wardrobe, and the honeymoon, amounts to about $2.8 million.  Below, check out Bride Book's breakdown of what the royal wedding will cost.","If you were to plan a royal wedding, where would you splurge? Let us know in the comments section below."
gossipcop-9362271023,1,0,"(Video provided by Splash News)  The Weeknd instigated his breakup with Selena Gomez, Gossip Cop can confirm. Gomez’s rekindled friendship with Justin Bieber, however, had nothing to do with the rapper’s decision to end his romance with the singer.  As Gossip Cop reported, Gomez and The Weeknd recently split after nearly a year of dating. The pair weren’t seen together much during the summer, though it was later revealed the singer-actress was laying low due to a kidney transplant. Regardless, they still appeared to be going strong in the early fall. Prior to the announcement of their breakup, the status of their relationship was questioned after it emerged Gomez had rekindled her friendship with Bieber. © Gossip Cop (Getty Images)  On Sunday, that speculation swirled as Bieber and Gomez were seen in public and The Weeknd stopped following her friends on social media. That being said, Bieber was allegedly not responsible for the breakup. Rather, it was the challenges of a long-distance relationship, particularly with The Weeknd touring and Gomez’s shooting schedule, that led both the former couple to reconsider their fizzling relationship.  Additionally, contributing to their split, the rapper felt “tied down” in a relationship that had lost its spark. Over time, the pair started talking less frequently on the phone, prompting The Weeknd to end his romance with Gomez, reports TMZ. Despite their breakup, we’re told that the pair are still on good terms and have talked several times since the split.  Predictably, after the rapper ended his relationship with Gomez, Gossip Cop busted the often disproven HollywoodLife for claiming in a made-up report that The Weeknd was “heartbroken” over Gomez reconnecting with Bieber. In the bogus story, the bad blog ridiculously asserted that The Weeknd and Gomez were caught in a “love triangle” with Bieber, but of course, the breakup had nothing to do with and wasn’t caused by the “Love Yourself” singer.

Summary of the passage:
The Weeknd was the one who initiated his breakup with Selena Gomez, and her renewed friendship with Justin Bieber did not play a role in their split. The couple's distance due to their careers and the loss of passion in their relationship led to the breakup. Despite the split, they remain on good terms."
gossipcop-3564164651,1,0,"Caitlyn Jenner is having weird sense of joy these days! Says Cellulite makes her feel more feminine!  Caitlyn Jenner, the TV personality, and a former Olympic gold medal-winning decathlon champion is having a different sense of the quality of expressing her womanhood. She says that the cellulite in her thighs, hips, and tummy is giving her different sense of joy and can’t wait to show it off.  A weird article  The headline “Cellulite Makes Cait Feel So Womanly!” from the National Enquirer/RadarOnline is trending these days. And do you want to know what the article says? You must have some info about this! It said:  Caitlyn Jenner is telling friends she can’t wait to wear a bikini this summer to show off some skin, and her recently acquired cellulite!  That seems really weird, doesn’t it? I mean showing it off in a bikini for what? After all, many people try to hide their cellulite and here Jenner is going to a different path. She is WAITING for the summer just to show it off! Just to remind you, the article also called her a “blabbermouth”. And I don’t think it could be wrong. She blabbering about things that makes no sense. Maybe her excessive talking needed a halt and this quoted name of her may stop her from talking much now. Let’s see what the article had to say other than that. It said:  She has this weird sense of joy when she sees patches of cellulite on her thighs, hips and tummy. The sight of lumpy flesh doesn’t upset her. It makes her feel more feminine!  Maybe Caitlyn is trying to respect her body by respecting what she has. You can’t just disrespect your body for having a lumpy flesh. It is your body after all and if you disrespect it by yourself and obviously you can’t expect respect from others, can you? And who knows, maybe that lumpy dimpled flesh will look really feminine on her. It is creating a buzz in the media as this is not what you hear from a TV personality everyday. After all, every ordinary people might have cellulite in their body. It also said that Jenner’s view: “dimpled feminine flesh as a rite of passage into true womanhood.” and it was also reported that she wouldn’t mind having more cellulite in her body in future. The story features a zoomed-in photo of purported cellulite on Jenner’s leg. Also, after all these years of being a decathlete and going through dieting for years, the 67 year old Jenner might not want to do it anymore. “So let it be!” is what she might have been thinking. Also, the other reason maybe her daughter Kim’s cellulite pictures that surfaced online. This might just be a way to support her daughter.  Rumors or truth  This is not the only time some issues or sites posted a rumor about Caitlyn Jenner. Just last year, a issue of National Enquirer said that Jenner “wants her BIG, clunky-feet reduced to more lady-like proportions.” Again, this just a few days ago, radar online was on about exploring her sexuality online and enjoying a number of secret ‘cyber hookups’. The transgender star, Jenner has had gender reassignment surgery as well as she said she was never interested in men. There are many rumors which may include some truth about Jenner.  Short Bio on Caitlyn Jenner  Caitlyn Jenner is a decathlete turned TV personality. She is known by her previous name “Bruce Jenner”. The Olympic gold medal winner came out as a transgender in April 2015. She is the celebrity from the reality show “Keeping Up with Kardashians” along with her daughters. She has undergone a knee surgery before which she was a college football player for the Graceland Yellowjackets. More Bio…",…

USA TODAY President Trump in Trump Tower. (Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP) Corrections & Clarifications: A previous version of the story included a tweet from a parody account claiming to Jill Biden. NEW YORK CITY – President Trump's argument Tuesday that left wing groups were just as violent as the white supremacists who staged a demonstration in Charlottesville set off a firestorm of criticism from members of his own party – and raised questions about his personal views of racial tensions in the country. Just one day after Trump sought to tamp down on controversy by condemning white supremacists for their role in racially motivated clashes in the Virginia city, the president appeared to return to his highly criticized initial response that many sides were to blame for the weekend violence. ""What about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, alt-right?"" Trump told reporters in a chaotic impromptu press conference at Trump Tower. ""Do they have any semblance of guilt? What about the fact they came charging with clubs in their hands?"" Trump said he couldn't make a condemnation of hate groups earlier because he didn't ""know all the facts"" about an alleged white nationalist who crashed a car into a crowd of protesters, killing one person and wounded 19 others. CLOSE From Trump Tower in New York City, President Trump told reporters that both sides were to blame for the violence that occurred in Charlottesville, Virginia. USA TODAY ""I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct,"" Trump said from Trump Tower in New York, after an event that was intended to be devoted to a new infrastructure executive order. Trump has been especially quick to denounce previous terrorist attacks, including those taking place overseas. Yet he was notably reticent to pinpoint the blame for one on Saturday that involved white supremacists – a point his critics on both sides of the aisle continued to hammer. ""We must be clear. White supremacy is repulsive. This bigotry is counter to all this country stands for. There can be no moral ambiguity,” said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. added: ""There is only one side to be on when a white supremacist mob brutalizes and murders in America.” Several lawmakers were dismayed the president appeared to equate white supremacists with their opponents. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., tweeted: ""Blaming 'both sides' for #Charlottesville?! No. Back to relativism when dealing with KKK, Nazi sympathizers, white supremacists? Just no."" Another Republican, Rep. Charlie Dent from Pennsylvania, said Trump ""must stop the moral equivalency! AGAIN."" Over the weekend, Trump faced heavy criticism from both Republicans and Democrats for chiding ""many sides"" for their role in the violence in Charlottesville on Saturday, a statement many regarded as tepid toward racists. A full two days later, on Monday, Trump at the White House directly condemned the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists and announced the Justice Department would open up a civil rights investigation into the driver of the car that killed Charlottesville resident Heather Heyer. Yet on Tuesday, amid questions about whether Trump meant the words behind his most recent scripted statement, the president called his initial response ""fine"" and blamed the press for being dishonest in its coverage. ""There was no way of making a correct statement that early,"" he said at one point. ""I had to see the facts. Unlike a lot of reporters – I didn't know (prominent white supremacist) David Duke was there. I wanted to see the facts."" For his part, former KKK leader Duke tweeted a thank you to the president after his statement Tuesday – for condemning ""the leftist terrorists"" in Black Lives Matter and Antifa.",of Robert E. Lee is a slippery slope. USA TODAY.

Did Mariah Carey, 47, have a vision of love when looking at boyfriend Bryan Tanaka, 34, one that left her feeling all sorts of emotions? After deciding that she just can’t let go of this hunk, Mariah reportedly decided to make it happen – an engagement, that is! “Word is Mariah took matters into her own hands,” a source tells OK! magazine, “It was an unusual proposal but it did the trick. She wrote a song about how she wanted Bryan to be her husband and she performed it for him while wearing a sexy, glitzy gown. Then she explained that she’s ready for them to make their relationship official.”  Bryan gave a “hearty yes,” as the insider says, “He couldn’t believe his luck!” It appears Bryan also thinks he and Mariah belong together, and he always wants to be her baby. These two aren’t waiting around for one sweet day to tie the knot. While love takes time, Mariah and Bryan are already busy making wedding plans. “Mariah would love to get married in May at the Grand Wailea Resort in Maui,” the insider told OK!, “where she and Bryan first went public with their romance.” Mariah and Bryan struck up a relationship in late 2016, with Mariah low-key confirming the romance in February 2017 by calling Bryan her “boyfriend.”  Mariah’s “also toying with the idea of a winter wonderland wedding,” the source says. “After all, she is the queen of Christmas!” Could Mariah have the fantasy holiday wedding she’s always wanted, saying “Thank God I found you” to her honey, her all? Whenever Mariah decides to get married, don’t forget about us when it comes to the wedding invitations!  This alleged engagement would be the third time Mariah walked down the aisle, as she was previously married to Tommy Mottola, 68, and Nick Cannon, 37. After dealing with a pair of heartbreakers, MiMi isn’t fooling around, especially when it comes to her $520 million fortune. She’s working on an ironclad prenup, according to OK! magazine. “She’s had tow failed marriages already,” the source says. “She’s not going to take any risks here.” Speaking of Nick, expect to see him during Mariah’s big day.  Nick and Mariah’s twins – son Morocco and daughter Monroe, 6 – will be featured in his wedding, and sources say Mariah’s thinking of asking Nick to walk her down the aisle. “[He] will always be a big part of her life,” the source added. Considering Mariah, Nick and the twins recently made an adorable appearance at the 2018 Kids’ Choice Awards, it makes total sense that Mariah’s ex would be on hand to see her say “I Do” again.","Only time will tell if Mariah Carey’s wedding bells are ringing true, but one thing’s for sure – the singer is ready to take a chance on love once more, and we’re rooting for her!"

Nevertheless, the family have been publicly supportive of her decision to transition, which was completed in January according leaked extracts from her memoir.  Jenner wrote of the $20,000 operation: 'The surgery was a success, and I feel not only wonderful but liberated […] I am going to live authentically for the first time in my life.  ‘I am going to have an enthusiasm for life that I have not had in 39 years since the Olympics, almost two thirds of my life.'

Sources close to the family told DailyMail.com that Jenner’s ‘unpredictable’ behavior has also played a part in their current estrangement.  The insider said: ‘[The book] is definitely something that she’s wanted to do for a while and it was just a matter of time before she got it done.  ‘But the family were like, it’s probably going to reopen the drama of everything [that has happened].  ‘They were worried because she’s been so unpredictable lately and just trying to get out into the limelight.’  Jenner's book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife  A second leaked extract from the memoir has already proven embarrassing, after Jenner claimed the late Robert Kardashian knew O.J. Simpson was guilty of the murder of his wife Nicole Brown and her friend Ron Goldman.  Kardashian, the father of Kourtney, Khloe, Kim and their brother Rob, was part of Simpson’s defense team during his 1","995 trial, which saw the former NFL star acquitted of the murders.  In the book, Jenner writes: ‘Robert told me that he is convinced that O.J. did it. He confided in me that he knew O.J. was guilty, but he wanted to believe that the police had framed him.  ‘He asked me, ""What if they have?"" I said, ""Rob, they didn't frame O.J. It was all O.J.""  ‘Robert was adamant that if O.J. didn't do it, he would have found the real killer. He was that good of a lawyer. He believed O.J. was guilty, but he had to defend him. He was obligated.’  The revelation has caused tension between Jenner and the Kardashian family, who have previously insisted that they do not believe Simpson was guilty of the murders."

The 20-year-old cosmetics guru — who is expecting her first child, a baby girl, with boyfriend Travis Scott — did not appear in any photos from the bash shared to social media by KarJenner family members. But a source tells PEOPLE she was there celebrating away from the cameras.  “Kylie looked great but didn’t really draw any attention to her baby bump,” the source says. “She still acts like she wants to keep her pregnancy private.”  Meanwhile, her sister Khloé Kardashian, — who earlier this week confirmed that she and boyfriend Tristan Thompson are expecting their first child together — accentuated her own baby bump in a skin-tight, sparkly jumpsuit with a white fur coat.  “Khloé was beaming all night,” the insider says of the 33-year-old Revenge Body host. “She kept touching and showing off her cute baby belly.”  Khloé showed off her bump on Instagram as well.  “Merry Christmas!! May you sparkle and shine this festive season, may all of your wishes and dreams come true,” Khloé captioned a gallery of shots showing her touching her belly. “I pray that we all may feel this happiness all year round. God bless you! ✨ #BabyBump🤗”  “Merry Christmas!!!!! Wishing all of you and your families much Joy Happiness Peace and Health…” Kris added in her own post, a photo of her and Khloé alongside Kendall Jenner. “Love you guys!!!!!!!! #christmas #blessed #ohholynight.”  Kim Kardashian West, Kris Jenner and Khloé Kardashian Khloe Kardashian/Instagram  Khloé Kardashian and Scott Disic Khloe Kardashian/Instagram  Aside for Khloé and Kendall, Kris’ party also brought together siblings Kim Kardashian West (who’s expecting her third child, via a surrogate), Kourtney Kardashian, and their kids: Kim’s daughter North, 4, and son Saint, 2; and Kourtney son Reign, 3, daughter Penelope, 5, and son Mason, 8.  Kourtney’s ex-boyfriend Scott Disick was there, too — without girlfriend Sofia Richie.  “He mingled, looked good and didn’t drink,” the source says, adding that there wasn’t any awkwardness with Kourtney’s new boyfriend Younes Bendjima.  “Kourtney seemed so happy that Younes joined her,” the insider says. “They are so cute together. He kept bringing her drinks and doting on her. Younes fits right into the family. He didn’t seem uncomfortable that Scott was there. They said hello, but that was it. It was very civil.”  Other guests included Kim’s husband Kanye West, celebrity hair stylists Jen Atkin and Chris Appleton, singer Christina Aguilera and Keeping Up with the Kardashians executive producer Ryan Seacrest. Kris appeared to be in a good mood throughout the night, dancing with Kim and Khloé and playing MC while Babyface, Toni Braxton and Brian McKnight performed.  “Everyone had the most amazing time,” the source tells PEOPLE. “Kris always throws the best parties.

gossipcop-5865271192,1,0,"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired. T","MZ reported at the time that the photos were taken on Sept. 5, 2017, which marked the exact date that the clause in the divorce agreement expired.  So even though the relationship was now officially out in the open, Holmes and Foxx continued to keep a relatively low profile.  But now that the relationship appears to be over, Holmes and Foxx are left to pick up the pieces and figure out how to move forward, both individually and as co-parents to Suri.  The breakup is a reminder that even when relationships are hidden, they’re still subject to the same ups and downs as any other romantic entanglement. And while it’s sad to see a relationship end, especially one that seemed to be a source of joy and support for both parties, it’s also a reminder that sometimes, it’s necessary to prioritize one’s own well-being and that of their family."

Kim, I haven’t talked to in a year,” Jenner said while discusing her memoir at the U.K.’s Cambridge Union, according to Cambridge News.  Although Kardashian West publicly supported Jenner’s journey, she cut ties after reading her book, which alleged Kris Jenner — Caitlyn’s ex-wife and Kim’s mom — knew more about her gender identity crisis than she’s admitted.  In an episode of KUWTK, the KKW Beauty mogul also revealed that she had been hurt by a chapter in the memoir in which Jenner implied that her late father Robert Kardashian thought his friend O.J. Simpson was guilty of having killed wife Nicole Brown Simpson and waiter Ron Goldman — despite having served as the NFL star’s defense attorney in his 1994 murder trial.  “My relationship with Caitlyn was strained,” the mother of three said during the episode, which aired October of last year. “I was just trying to be respectful. But if you talk about my dad, I will cut you.”  Despite their estrangement, in April of last year Kardashian West told Ellen Degeneres that she would “always love her” for helping raise her and her sisters.","However, it seems that the rift is still ongoing, as Jenner’s recent comments indicate that the pair haven’t reconciled."

Last week, pictures surfaced on TMZ that showed Mrs. Kelly, the new face of NBC, on the Los Angeles set of “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” after conducting a lengthy interview with Kris Jenner and all of her daughters – Kendall and Kylie Jenner, and Kourtney, Kim, and Khloé Kardashian.  It was made known that Caitlyn Jenner and Rob Kardashian had opted to skip the chitchat and for obvious reasons, Blac Chyna and Tyga were not invited.  As for Kanye West being absent, no explanation was given – as the saying goes, Kanye does what Kanye wants.  The retired Olympic gold medal-winning decathlete, who is currently promoting her new memoir, “The Secrets of My Life,” is embroiled in a nasty fight with ex-wife, Kris Jenner, and is said to be allergic to all things Kardashian.  Swish A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Mar 31, 2017 at 4:39pm PDT  A source close to the former “I Am Cait” star said she will not watch Kelly’s interview and added: “Caitlyn has no intentions on watching their interview with Megyn Kelly. She knows they aren’t going to say nice things about her, so why subject herself to the insults.”  The tipster went on to explain that the 67-year-old television personality is upset that her daughters – Kendall and Kylie – took part in the charade.  The person revealed: “She’s hoping her daughters, Kendall and Kylie, were able to persuade their mother not to discuss Caitlyn in-depth.Caitlyn thinks is awful that Kris is basically calling her a liar and possibly damaging her relationship with the girls.”  Kourt looking for zero fucks to give on her 38th bday looking soooo good A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Apr 18, 2017 at 7:34pm PDT  On the April 28th episode of “The Ellen DeGeneres Show,” Kim slammed Caitlyn for attacking her family in her new memoir and for insulting her mother.

I mean, my mom, like, literally from the beginning supported Caitlyn. And Caitlyn has never been a father to us. You know, my dad, like, always taught us, like, family is everything. And Caitlyn’s, like, all about Caitlyn.”  Khloé Kardashian, on the other hand, has been more sympathetic towards Caitlyn’s situation, but still thinks she could have handled things differently.  In an interview with “Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen,” Khloé said: “I think Caitlyn has every right to feel however she feels. I don’t feel like she’s a bad person. I just think that, you know, she could have handled it a little bit differently. But at the end of the day, it’s really not my business.”  It seems the Kardashian-Jenner family drama is far from over, and we can expect to see more fireworks in the coming weeks as Caitlyn continues to promote her memoir."

Every relationship has its ups and downs, but when we’re talking about Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez, that’s approximately seven years of roller-coaster emotions. The two sparked dating rumours in 2010 and captured the hearts of both their fan bases, resulting in the #Jelena hashtag. Since Bieber and Gomez are two of the most famous young stars of their time, their admirers range from supportive to downright obsessive. Their relationship is kind of very hard to follow, but luckily, we’ve broken down every single one of their breakups and makeups. Grab a snack, because there’s a lot to dive into. photography via instagram.com/jelena_firstofall January 2011: Vacation in St. Lucia Bieber/Gomez dating rumours began to circulate in 2010.

gossipcop-2388806885,1,0,"R. Kelly’s time may have finally come. R. Kelly has been accused of sexual relationships with minors going back to 1994, when he married 15-year-old pop star Aaliyah. (The marriage was annulled.) In the 24 years since then, he has been sued multiple times for inappropriate sexual contact with a minor (he settled out of court every time), and he was eventually charged with creating child pornography. (A jury found him not guilty on the grounds that they could not conclusively identify the other figure in his infamous sex tape as a child.) Last summer, he was accused of creating an abusive “sex cult” of very young women, whom he allegedly isolates, brainwashes, and abuses physically and emotionally. Since the story broke, multiple women have added their own testimonies of abuse at R. Kelly’s hands. (Through a lawyer, Kelly denied all accusations, saying he would “work diligently and forcibly to pursue his accusers and clear his name.”) And in April, another woman accused Kelly of “knowingly and intentionally infecting her with an STD.” Her lawyers say they are currently preparing a federal civil lawsuit. Through a spokesperson, Kelly issued a statement to the Washington Post in which he “categorically denies all claims and allegations.” As man after man has fallen to the #MeToo reckoning, losing jobs and retiring from public life after being accused of sexual harassment and assault, there’s been a recurring whisper: What about R. Kelly? Despite decades of lawsuits and allegations, Kelly’s career has marched steadily on. Last year, he finished an arena tour with a few cancellations. This year, he’s touring with singer Charlie Wilson (some protests are planned). His music appeared in Pitch Perfect 3. At this year’s Coachella, rapper Vince Staples repeatedly referred to Kelly as a “child molester” in an interview with Complex, insisting, “He pees on people.” In our post-#MeToo, post-Time’s Up, post-Harvey Weinstein world, and given the sheer volume of allegations against Kelly, it seems reasonable to raise the question of why he continues to work as much as he does. But Staples’s interviewer only giggled nervously and protested, “We can’t ever talk about this guy. ... You’re about to get me fired from Coachella. It’s my first time here.” Later, Staples tweeted that “R. Kelly people is looking for me.” ladies and gentlemen, vince staples on r kelly pic.twitter.com/SmZdYu9PNJ — andy (@aboynamedandy) April 16, 2018 That stasis may be starting to change. Most of the claims against Kelly were reiterated in a recent BBC Three documentary, R Kelly: Sex, Girls & Videotapes. And over the past year, at least five members of Kelly’s inner circle have left him. His assistant, his accountant, his lawyer, and his rep have all said that they no longer work for him, although none of them have gone into detail about their departures and all have been supportive and complimentary toward Kelly in their statements. His longtime musical accompanist, DJ Phantom, was less circumspect about his decision to leave Kelly in December: “I didn’t know then what I know now,” he said. “He’s a shitbag.” In April, the Women of Color committee within Time’s Up threw its weight behind the #MuteRKelly campaign, calling for anyone currently profiting from Kelly and his music to drop him, including Spotify, Ticketmaster, and Kelly’s record label, RCA. Shortly thereafter, Spotify announced that it would no longer be promoting Kelly’s music, although his music would remain in their streaming catalog. It’s possible that these new developlments mean things are changing for Kelly, and that he’s about to face lasting consequences for those accusations. But if that’s the case, those consequences took more than two decades to reach him. There is a persistent vagueness to the way we talk about R. Kelly that makes it possible to forget exactly what he’s been accused of, how often he’s been accused, and how much proof there is against him. And most likely, that’s because his alleg","by the marriage.” Aaliyah died in a plane crash in 2001. 1996: Tiffany Hawkins sues Kelly for sexual battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress Hawkins, then 27, met Kelly in 1991 when she was 15. In 1996, she sued him for sexual battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress, claiming that their relationship began when she was a minor and that Kelly had initiated a sexual relationship with her. The lawsuit was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount. 1998: Tracy Sampson files a lawsuit against Kelly, claiming he initiated a sexual relationship with her when she was 16 Sampson was a former intern at Epic Records. In her lawsuit, she claimed that Kelly began a sexual relationship with her when she was 16 and he was 31. The case was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount. 2002: Patrice Jones files a lawsuit against Kelly, claiming he engaged in a sexual relationship with her when she was 14 Jones was a 14-year-old fan when she met Kelly in 1998.

Here’s how the Biebs is coping with his time apart from Sel.  Justin Bieber, 24, is going through a tough time as his relationship with Selena Gomez, 25, is on pause. She’s currently on vacation with friends in Sydney, Australia, where she appears to be carefree in this new video. However, a source reveals that the same can’t be said for Bieber. “Justin has Selena on the brain constantly. He is trying to drown it out by hanging with friends and doing stuff on his own time but he keeps thinking about her,” a source EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com. “He always wants to be around her, talk to her and be with her. She is like a drug for him, he just needs more and more and more.”  As the Biebs continues to struggle with their time apart, he’s got a few things up his sleeve for when she returns to LA. “He can’t wait until she is back because he wants to really wine and dine her upon her return and really kick start the relationship back up again,” the insider reveals. It’s unclear when Sel is scheduled to return to the West Coast. But, as seen on her Instagram, she is having the time of her life. She posted a video which showed her laughing on a boat, accompanied by a subliminal message, that she “chose” to take care of herself, “not to prove anything to anyone.” Was she trying to give us insight into her most recent split with Bieber?  Jelena fans went into panic mode after seeing Sel in the arms of another man on a boat on March 19. She was photographed hugging and goofing off in photos with Sydney native, Johnny Rays. While all signs point to a friendship between the two, the photos didn’t appear that way to some fans who claimed they looked too close for comfort.  While Sel has been vacationing Down Under, Bieber has been staying active. He’s been photographed playing hockey and soccer with friends. However, his emotions may be getting the best of him as he took a gnarly fall during a soccer game on March 19, and seemingly broke down on the sidelines of a hockey game on March 17.  As you may recall, Jelena reunited in October 2017, after her split with The Weeknd, 28. They seemed inseparable, having spent New Year’s together in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. However, their romance took a rocky turn around Bieber’s birthday on March 1, according to reports.","“Justin and Selena had another dramatic breakup and it seems like they are done for now,” a source told E! News. “They were having a lot of little disagreements recently and one fight led to them deciding to take some time apart from each other. It’s possible they will get back together because they have in the past, but for now they are apart.”  With both parties dealing with the split in different ways, fans can’t help but wonder if they’ll ultimately reconcile. Only time will tell if this breakup will be permanent or if Jelena will give their relationship another shot.  Until then, we’ll be keeping a close eye on their social media accounts for any hints about their relationship status."

Now, a new report claims that the Friends star has hired a surrogate, could there be any truth to the story?  In the new issue of Star, the tabloid features the headline, “Jen To Justin: I’ll Raise Our Baby Alone!” followed by a story that asserts Aniston wants to become a mom, and she will do it with or without her husband. The publication claims to have a source that reveals Aniston’s marriage is “on the rocks,” and she is planning to be a single mom.  ?…❤️✌️ A post shared by @justintheroux on Aug 5, 2017 at 4:23pm PDT  “Privately, she has told friends that she’s secretly gone ahead and hired a surrogate mother to carry her child to birth. And she’s vowed to raise the baby alone,” tells the insider.  But then the source says the actress is hoping to choose the right woman soon, completely contradicting the earlier quote, which is a huge red flag that something isn’t right with this claim.  But many think the tabloid story is completely false and contradictory quotes prove the story is garbage, questioning why the insider is sharing such private and secret information with a tabloid.  This is the same magazine that published a story earlier this year claiming Aniston herself was pregnant, but then didn’t mention that at all in its latest baby claims.  Aniston told Glamour magazine back in August that not only are the pregnancy tabloid stories guilty of body shaming, but they are also an invasion into a private matter between her and her husband. She said it is no one’s business whether or not she has a baby.  Jennifer Aniston went on to say that the subject of having a baby is a sensitive topic for her, and no one has the right to judge other people’s choices.  Advertisement  What is right for her, may not be right for someone else; and, no one knows what goes on behind closed doors.","It's not for anyone to dictate or assume what a person’s life should look like.  The only way to get the truth about a celebrity’s life is to hear it directly from them or their representative, not from a tabloid.  As for now, Aniston and Theroux continue to share sweet moments on social media, but the couple has not made any comments about the latest surrogate claims.  Fans continue to hope that the two will have a happy and healthy life together, whether they decide to have children or not."
gossipcop-5840642713,1,0,"Sky high prices are reportedly keeping fans from buying tickets to Taylor Swift’s upcoming Reputation tour, per a story by the New York Post. Though her 1989 world tour boasted numerous sold out performances (it eventually became the highest grossing tour of 2015), it appears her considerably more expensive snake persona is a tougher sell.  Last month, her “longtime” tour promoter told Billboard, “By the time all the tickets are sold next week, I’ll be celebrating Taylor’s birthday with a cocktail in my hand and sold-out concerts all over the world.” But her birthday has come and gone, and not one date has sold out.  Reputation was the biggest-selling album of 2017 and the tour is shaping up to be far from ill-attended, so the Post’s headline, “Taylor Swift’s Reputation tour shaping up to be a disaster,” is a little much. It does, however, highlight the problems with unpredictable pricing, scalpers, and Ticketmaster in general.  The company’s “Verified Fan” program, which they would like you to believe is all about rewarding music lovers, appears to be nothing but a cash grab that takes advantage of Swift-obsessed teens with easy access to their parents’ credit card numbers. People willing to drop $50 on merch, the Post reports, could “improve [their] position in line to purchase tickets.” And, once accessible, the tickets are often too expensive for many fans.  “I paid $150 for my ticket with amazing seats for the 1989 tour,” one fan wrote. “Now for the same seats I have to pay about $500.”  Advertisement  In related news, tickets to Katy Perry’s Friday show in New Orleans are currently starting at $23.","The Post piece also points out that the pricing strategy may be aimed at keeping seats open for corporate clients. But, as one source put it, “There are only so many corporate clients to go around.”  The real issue here is the lack of transparency in ticket pricing, which is something that the Fan Freedom Project has been fighting against for years. The organization, co-founded by country star Eric Church, aims to end “price-gouging and give fans the freedom to buy and sell tickets at a fair price.”  It’s a noble cause that’s sure to resonate with anyone who’s ever tried to buy a ticket only to be met with sky-high prices and frustratingly opaque sales processes.  Swift may not be having the smoothest tour launch in history, but at least she’s got her famous friends to keep her company."

gossipcop-6225895099,1,0,"Chris Soules, former star of ABC’s “The Bachelor,” after his arrest. (Buchanan County Sheriff via AP) Iowa farmer Chris Soules, a former star on ABC’s “The Bachelor” who charmed reality TV viewers with his small-town life, was arrested this week after police said he fled a crash that killed a fellow farmer. Soules, 35, was charged with leaving the scene of a fatal crash, a class D felony, and could face up to five years in prison if he is convicted. The case has garnered the attention of Soules’s “Bachelor” fans as well as residents of Arlington, Iowa, where he lives, who had come to appreciate the reality TV star’s work as an unofficial Iowa ambassador and farm industry advocate. “This story is going to spread like wildfire around here and probably all over because of who he is,” Mary Jo Brown, Arlington’s city clerk, told the Des Moines Register. “Sometimes fame isn’t your friend.” Soules, who also appeared in “Dancing with the Stars” and “Worst Chefs in America,” called 911 at 8:20 p.m. Monday evening to report that he had rear-ended a tractor on a rural road north of the tiny town of Aurora, about six miles away from his home. The tractor veered into a ditch after being struck by his 2008 Chevrolet Silverado, Soules said. The tractor driver — later identified as 66-year-old Kenneth Mosher, a Vietnam War veteran — was unconscious and not breathing, Soules told the 911 operator, according to audio obtained by local media. The man had a pulse, but there was blood around his mouth, Soules said. Soules identified himself on the call, which lasted nearly six minutes, and sounded frantic. Between heavy breathing, he answered the dispatcher’s questions and took instructions. Soules told the 911 operator he did not know how to perform CPR and could be heard asking unidentified people at the scene if they could perform the lifesaving measure. The call ended abruptly after the operator told Soules law enforcement and medical first responders were on the way. “Can I, can I call you back really quick?” Soules asked the dispatcher. “Yeah, you can call me back,” she says. “Thank you,” Soules responds. Soules left the crash site after emergency responders arrived, but before deputies with the Buchanan County Sheriff’s Office were on the scene, according to authorities. Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Scott Bright told the Des Moines Register that Soules fled the scene on foot and later got into a truck. In police audio obtained by local media, a deputy told a dispatcher that Soules “took off” in a red truck. Authorities are trying to identify who picked up Soules in the truck, Buchanan County Sheriff Bill Wolfgram told the Associated Press. That person could face charges, he said. Alcohol was found at the scene and investigators are trying to determine whose it was and whether it or speed were factors in the crash. Soules was arrested about five hours after the incident and booked into the Buchanan County Jail, the Associated Press reported. He posted a $10,000 bond Tuesday morning and was released on the condition that he surrender his passport and wear an electronic monitor. During his first appearance in court, the Buchanan County assistant attorney told the judge that Soules refused to cooperate with law enforcement after they located him at his home. He “would not come out,” the attorney said, until officials obtained a search warrant, which “took hours.” Chris Soules making his initial court appearance in Buchanan County @KWWL pic.twitter.com/72bvEg0wVR — Elizabeth Amanieh (@EAmaniehKWWL) April 25, 2017 Wolfgram told the Associated Press that investigators were “running into some roadblocks when it comes to getting information” but acknowledged Soules was acting within his constitutional rights. According to court documents, Soules had several run-ins with the law in his early 20s. In 2011, he was charged three times with underage alcohol possession and pleaded guilty and paid a fine for an open container violation, reported the Des Moines R",a beach in Mexico.

ET’s Katie Krause spoke with Brolin at the Hallmark Channel and Hallmark Movies & Mysteries winter Television Critics Association red carpet on Saturday, where he revealed that despite his decades-long romance, he still doesn't have all the answers.  “I don’t know, because nobody trains you,” he said of the secret to his and Streisand's marriage. “This is my third time -- third marriage. I picked difficult situations the first two times, but I think you learn with each one. I’m a person that believes that if I’m wrong, that’s when I learn, and when I’m right, I haven’t learned a thing.”  Noting that he takes his relationship “day to day,” Brolin revealed that he’s an advocate of marriage counseling.  “I do believe in counseling if anybody ever has a problem in their marriage. Bring in a referee, talk it over, and I swear to you, it will dispel by the end of the session, each time!” he said. “Sometimes in a tough marriage, it’s tough to talk, but if you do, it works!”  The 77-year-old actor has also learned to maintain his marriage with Streisand by not interrupting her during hectic times.  “When she’s busy, she’s really focused, and part of our good relationship is that I understand that,” he shared. “And if I come to her with something important and she says, ‘I don’t have time right now,’ she doesn’t have time, period. That’s the way the mind works. You gotta focus.”  As for how Streisand, 75, makes him feel special, Brolin said, “I’m always welcome when I get home. I always get notes, ‘Hurry home!’ When I get there, there’s always something kind of great waiting for me, some plan, and I try to reciprocate.”  RELATED CONTENT:  Barbra Streisand Calls Out Golden Globes for Not Awarding More Female Directors  ‘Girls Trip' Star Tiffany Haddish Says She Taught Barbra Streisand All About Cardi B  Josh Brolin on His Ripped Bod and How He Knew Wife Kathyrn Boyd Was the One (Exclusive)  Related Gallery",:  Hollywood's Longest Lasting Marriages

Up till tpo that moment Crazy Jo-lie had kept Brad far from Jen. Make no mistake about it. Her frantic traveling all over the place was an attempt at keeping Pitt away from her and and any other person who might think they were a friend. She can't stand anyone but her having anything to do with Pitt . Including his own family. I knew it would backfire one day. Brad what took so long????? She suffers from an extreme mental illness. She doesn't have the kids in school for the same reason.  I do believe she thought it would last. Seeing how sexy and pretty she thinks she is. A man should and would do anything she tells them to.  I am under the impression her treatment of her surrogate Holly had a sort of wake up call to Pitt as to how utterly evil she is. You can bet she dismissed her like a piece of shite. A woman who carried twins for her. Started making Brad see her game of using and abusing.  And when Jen said her and Brad talk all the time on the phone you know that was news to little miss do as I say not as I do Angelina still talks to her ex's Jo-LIE.    Guess all the years of trying to force Brad to believe Jen was a shallow no good woman has a way of catching up to one. It took this long for Pitt to see just what had truly happened. Her spells have lost the power to confuse.In Touch said she has a terrible jealous streak and can't stand Brad even looking at a woman SHE DEEMS ATTRACTIVE IN ANY WAY. WE ALL KNOW HOW MUCH FUN THAT CAN BE.    The National Enquirer  Says Brad is so happy to have a separation from her.Brad's closest friends are woman and that drives Angelina nuts she hates sharing him  He was mad she took the salt role because she had promised him she would stay at home and be a mom.  I mean you can see her doing whatever she damn well wanted to. And he went along with it. But they have twin babies and my guess is she spends very little time bonding with them. What woman would not want to be able to stay with her new little babies. Not this woman. Sick behavior for sure. And the only thing keeping Brad from making it final is the kids.  Angie be careful what you wish for. Seems like 6 kids are going to be without a mom and dad in one place. Good luck with that",. But maybe Brad can't handle it. Maybe he likes the idea of someone else doing the work. Just maybe he's a bit lazy and likes the idea of having his cake and eating it too. Why else would he let her run wild for so long.
gossipcop-8342414455,1,0,"Forget Wills and Kate's dusty old Norfolk. The lovebirds want to hang out with the groovy set in the Cotswolds - and the local estate agents' eyes are lighting up. There comes a time in every couple's relationship when the question of moving in together becomes impossible to ignore. And when those two lovebirds have been stepping out for 15 months — even though they live 3,500 miles apart; he in the UK, she in Canada — it's not so much a case of 'if' as of 'when' they will settle down. So it comes as no surprise that Prince Harry, 33, and his actress girlfriend Meghan Markle, 36, are said to be house-hunting. £7.25million - North Aston Manor, Oxfordshire: This eight bedroom property, overlooking the stunning Cherwell Valley, has seven reception rooms, a spa, swimming pool and 18.2 acres with equestrian facilities. It's nine miles from Soho Farmhouse and swanky shopping centre Bicester Village, should Meghan fancy snapping up some designer bargains Prince Harry and actress girlfriend Meghan Markle were pictured together at the Invictus Games in Toronto last month Royal sources have exclusively told the Daily Mail that the royal couple are looking in Oxfordshire and are particularly interested in high-end properties tucked away in the rolling Cotswold hills. A good friend of Harry's says the Prince, whose father's residence, Highgrove House, is in the south Cotswolds, has a long-standing affection for the area, while Meghan is said to be entranced by its rustic charm. 'He is searching for a new home in the area,' the friend reveals. 'Before Meghan, he was vaguely looking in Norfolk, but didn't find what he wanted. Now, with her input, he's renewed his search.' £2million - The Old Rectory, Lower Brailes, Oxfordshire: A stunning wood-panelled property dating from the 14th century, this boasts eight bedrooms, a sun-drenched terrace and its own private lake, complete with duck house. There’s a three-bedroom coach house for guests and it’s set at the end of a no-through road. Certainly, the lush green countryside encompassing swathes of Warwickshire, Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire is a huge draw for London-dwellers eager to snap up rural boltholes. Just an hour or so from the capital, it's home (or at least a weekend retreat) to A-listers, politicians and media executives: the Camerons, Beckhams, Kate Moss, Lily Allen and Stella McCartney all have million-pound properties in the area. 'It's like a magnet,' says Sophie Gannon, of Savills Estate Agents in Banbury, Oxfordshire. 'If you get one person, you get them all.' However, Harry isn't following the crowd but listening to his heart. The Cotswolds, and specifically Highgrove, which was bought by his father's private estate in 1980, is where the Prince spent much of his childhood. It was Charles and Diana's weekend home, with 15-acre grounds and, later on, a teenage haven in the cellars of the main house, which Harry nicknamed 'Club H'. £2.95million - Fanthill, Banbury, Oxfordshire: Accessed through electric gates, up a winding driveway, this eight-bedroom house sits among 20 acres of land, so ticks all Harry’s boxes when it comes to privacy. There’s a heated outdoor pool, miniature golf course and a carp lake, where the young lovebirds could row off the private pier A local who knows the family says: 'It's not surprising that Harry would like to live where he feels at home. 'He's lived in the Cotswolds all his life and often returns to visit his father. After his mother died, it became a place of sanctuary. 'When the boys entered their teens, Charles bought several homes in the area, thinking they might want one in the future.' Ten years ago, Charles bought up properties adjacent to his sprawling estate, paying £2 million apiece for nearby manor houses and farm buildings. But sources say rather than living off his father's generosity, Harry wants to invest in a place of his own. £4.25million - Cross Hill House, Adderbury, Oxfordshire: This 10-bedroom house, surrounded by landscaped","a long-distance relationship. The area is also a haven for security-conscious celebrities, who value its discretion and privacy."

It’s no secret that Jennifer Lopez-at 48-has a body that won’t quit and skin that needs to be studied so we can all age like the goddess she is.  Dramatic? Not even close.  And while a lot of it may be down to great genes, Lopez has revealed in a new interview some of her beauty secrets and yep, they’re as diva as you might expect.  Lopez credits her glow to positive affirmations, revealing she says one in particular to herself every day to keep her radiant, youthful look intact.  So what is this magic phrase?  “I am youthful and timeless at every age,” Lopez says every single day—but it’s not enough to just say the mantra daily, because Lopez also has a handful of pillows with these words and more mantras embroidered into them all over her home. “I tell myself that every day, a few times a day. It sounds like clichéd bullshit, but it’s not: Age is all in your mind. Look at Jane Fonda.”  Lopez continues, “The affirmations are everywhere. I forget that they’re all here. They’re just part of the house now.”  Before you scoff at Lopez’s positivity there is a school of thought that believes negative thoughts can age you. Australian-born Dr Blackburn, a Nobel Prize winner, co-authored The Telomere Effect: A Revolutionary Approach to Living Younger, Healthier, Longer, with anti-aging psychologist Dr Elissa Epel, which investigated the link between telomeres, which protect our chromosomes, and the effect stress, sleep and diet can have on telomeres and how that directly corresponds with our health.  The book asserts there is a correlation between depression and anxiety and shorter telomeres and that “when pessimists develop an aging-related illness, like cancer or heart disease, the illness tends to progress faster.”  And really there's only so far a little highlight can go, step one is all about a positive attitude. Step two is to find yourself a great pillowcase and settle on your new mantra.  So what’s the lesson here? Your inner glow is only a glass half full attitude away.","And if you’re not ready to embrace Lopez’s level of diva, there’s always silk pillowcases."

Each time Channing and Jenna head to mediation to discuss the terms of their divorce, “they can’t seem to agree on anything,” says a source. “Their meetings have been contentious.” One big issue: their five-year-old daughter, Everly. “They can’t agree on custody,” a friend tells In Touch exclusively.      Unicorns do exist. A post shared by Channing Tatum (@channingtatum) on May 4, 2018 at 6:40pm PDT      “They’re both working hard to do what’s in the best interest of their daughter, but it’s just taking way longer than they both expected because they can’t agree on the small details.” Another sticking point: Channing’s estimated $60 million fortune. Though Jenna, 37, has had a successful movie and TV career with shows like Supergirl, Channing, 38, has starred in several blockbusters, such as Magic Mike and 21 Jump Street, and was the family’s main breadwinner. “Jenna has told friends that she gave Channing the best years of her life,” says the source, “and now she’s trying to negotiate a very secure future for herself.”  There is a lot at stake financially. During the course of their marriage, the pair acquired several assets, including a $6 million Beverly Hills home and pricey cars including a Tesla and a vintage Chevrolet truck. Finding common ground about dividing their stuff “is not easy,” says the friend. “They both want it to be over with.”          Jenna never thought it would come to this. “She isn’t pleased about how it’s all played out so far,” says the source. “She’s bitter. There are days when she’s blaming him for not working harder to save their marriage.” And while she’s told pals that she hopes they can stay friends, adds the source, deep down “she knows that’s never going to happen.”  Channing shouldn’t underestimate Jenna, says the source: “She’s looking out for herself, and at the end of the day she knows that he’s got to pay.

From “cool pants” to clover emojis, there’s a lot of backstory that needs explaining in order to completely understand everything that went down among Kanye West and Wiz Khalifa and Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna. To keep you informed, Us Weekly has broken it down with a comprehensive timeline of events. Kanye West Dates Amber Rose In 2008, the Grammy-winning rapper started a relationship with unknown model Rose after spotting her in Ludacris’ “What Them Girls Like” music video. The pair had a public two-year romance. Amber Rose Breaks Up With Kanye West In mid-2010, Rose called things off with West. A year after the split, Rose appeared on The Wendy Williams Show, noting, “[Kanye] said that he was an a-hole and he was mean to me and he didn’t treat me the way he was supposed to. I accepted his apology because I feel like he’s remorseful for how he treated me.” Blac Chyna and Tyga Have a Son, Get Engaged Meanwhile, an up-and-coming rapper named Tyga welcomed a baby boy named King Cairo Stevenson with his then-girlfriend, model Blac Chyna, in October 2012. “Most amazing feeling ever. #Blessed #2Kings,” Tyga captioned a Twitter photo cradling his little boy. That December, the couple confirmed they were engaged in an Instagram post featuring Chyna’s giant diamond ring. Kanye West Starts Dating Kim Kardashian Fresh off his split from Rose, West set his sights on his longtime friend and crush Kim Kardashian in early 2012. The pair were spotted out together and Kardashian’s famous family even started pressing the reality star for details on her new romance (remember when he let her borrow his car?!). Kanye West Raps About Wiz Khalifa, Amber Rose As West’s romance with Kardashian blossomed, so did that of his ex Rose and her new rapper fiancé, Wiz Khalifa. In April 2012, West released the song “Cold” in which he rapped, “Only n—a I got respect for is Wiz / And I’ll admit, I had fell in love with Kim around the same time she had fell in love with him.” Amber Rose Marries Wiz Khalifa After Welcoming Son Sebastian In February 2013, Rose and Khalifa had their first child, son Sebastian, announcing the news on Twitter. In July 2013, the couple secretly wed; the next month, they had a big ceremony in which Rose wore a stunning Pnina Tornai for Kleinfeld gown. She didn’t share photos from the private event until their one-year anniversary. North West Is Born Following a difficult pregnancy, Kim gave birth to her daughter, North West, in June 2013.

His exit followed months of erratic behavior: avoiding appearances on the family’s reality series, Keeping Up With the Kardashians, significant weight gain and depression. He’s stayed out of the public eye ever since. “He sent me a long email the morning of [saying] that he was going to leave,” Kim later said on Watch What Happens Live. “There was no fight.” Blac Chyna and Tyga Split In August 2014, the parents called it quits. “They are trying to keep it amicable,” ","ONLY 17,” Khloé tweeted, later adding, “Please stop talking about us in interviews mama. None of us talk about you.” Kanye West and Wiz Khalifa Feud Over “Khalifa” and “Waves” In January 2016, the long-simmering tension between West and Khalifa boiled over when the “Black and Yellow” rapper announced he was changing his name to Wiz Khalifa, prompting West to tweet, “Hey Wiz, can we get our first hit together?” Khalifa responded by calling West out for mentioning his then-infant son, Sebastian, in a since-deleted tweet. The back-and-forth continued with West claiming he owns the rights to the “Waves” name for his upcoming album, which Khalifa later mocked."

gossipcop-9639077061,1,0,"Ivanka Trump is becoming one of the most powerful first children in American History – despite not having an official job in the Trump administration. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) Ivanka Trump’s products weren’t always the hottest items online. In January, for instance, the first daughter’s fashion line ranked No. 550 based on the number of orders from Lyst, the biggest fashion e-commerce website in the world, according to Forbes. That changed dramatically the following month. Sales of Trump’s products skyrocketed in early February, making her Lyst’s 11th most popular brand. The biggest spike, according to Lyst, came on Feb. 9, when sales jumped by 219 percent from the day before. Yes, Feb. 9 — the same day that White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted Trump’s clothing and jewelry line on “Fox & Friends.” “Go buy Ivanka’s stuff is what I would tell you,” Conway said. “I’m going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody.” And viewers did, apparently. Sales of Ivanka Trump’s branded products skyrocketed on Feb. 9, the same day White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted the line on Fox News. (Lyst) Abigail Klem, president of the Ivanka Trump brand, said in a statement that “the beginning of February” shows “the best performing weeks in the history of the brand.” “For several different retailers, Ivanka Trump was a top performer online, and in some of the categories it was the best performance ever,” Klem said. Sarah Tanner, Lyst’s spokeswoman, said increases in sales are usually tied to current events. For instance, interest in pantsuits went up by 460 percent last year because of Hillary Clinton’s affinity for the style, she said. Sales of the first daughter’s products went up by 86 percent in November when her father won the presidential election, according to the company. Conway has come under fire for touting Ivanka Trump's clothing line during a televised interview. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) [A Trump wine boycott backfires spectacularly] But the brand was “largely featured” in the news in February, Tanner said. Conway gave her on-air endorsement of Ivanka Trump’s brand after President Trump had complained on Twitter that his daughter had “been treated so unfairly” by the department store Nordstrom, which dropped her clothing line over slow sales. “It would not be a surprise to us if it resulted in the increase in sales,” Tanner said of Conway’s Fox interview. “I think that’s one of the reasons the brand was largely in the news and could have attributed to this increase.” Conway did not respond to an email requesting comment. Her promotion of the fashion line appeared to violate an ethics rule barring federal employees from using their public office to endorse products and immediately drew criticism from both Democrats and Republicans. [Where does the Ivanka Trump brand go from here?] Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said Conway’s comments were “absolutely wrong, wrong, wrong” and “clearly over the line,” The Washington Post reported. The White House later said that Conway had been “counseled.” But concerns about her comments remain. On Thursday, the government’s top ethics official criticized the White House for not disciplining Conway, The Post’s Drew Harwell reported. Walter M. Shaub Jr., director of the Office of Government Ethics, had urged officials last month to reprimand the White House counsel but was rebuffed. On Thursday he wrote to Stefan C. Passantino, who handles White House ethics issues as the president’s deputy counsel. “When an employee’s conduct violates, disciplinary action serves to deter future misconduct,” Shaub wrote. “Not taking disciplinary action against a senior official under such circumstances risks undermining the ethics program.” [A Trump voter’s message to retailers: ‘Keep your mouths shut about our president’] Last month, a group of law professors filed a professional misconduct complaint against Conway — a",

A source told US magazine OK!: “When they got back together, Liam thought things would be different, but Miley hasn’t changed at all.  “She’s sobered up but she’s still immature and isn’t ready to commit to spending the rest of her life with one person.  “They do love each other but at this point it’s starting to become clear this relationship simply can’t go the distance.”  Miley and Liam are have tried couple’s therapy according to the magazine, but it hasn’t worked and only led to more fights. Liam is also said by friends to be envious of his brother, Chris, having three kids with his wife Elsa Pataky, but while he’s feeling more and more broody, Miley is not ready to commit to children and wants to focus on her career and having fun.","The source added: “Liam feels like he’s wasted so much time on Miley and nothing has changed.  “He’s starting to realize they’re just not meant to be, and he’s reluctantly come to the conclusion that it’s time to move on.”"
gossipcop-4200983209,1,0,"According to the South African newspaper The Times — which ran a story about her 67-page contract with the concert promoter Kusasa, the organizer of the South African leg of her current tour — she has some interesting personnel requirements, as well.    Onstage with her at all times must be those 11 security guards — eight of whom are to be on chairs that can swivel 30 degrees. (I know there's a lot of kidnapping in South Africa, but that's going a little overboard.)","And there must be a doctor, paramedic and a physiotherapist on hand at all times. Plus, she gets a hotel room to herself, even when she's not checking in.    But perhaps the most unsettling demand is that she has to be driven around in an armored car. This is not because of the crime rate in South Africa, but because she's been in two previous car crashes and is now terrified of being in a car. (Given her history, you can understand why she'd be a little freaked out.)    In the contract, there's also a clause that says she doesn't have to do any interviews, and she can't be photographed in a swimsuit. (There's a picture of her in a bikini in the newspaper, and let's just say it's not her best look.) And she can't be pictured eating or drinking. (Guess that puts an end to any shots of her at a sidewalk café, sipping a latte and nibbling on a croissant.)    But the thing that really caught my eye was that she can't travel more than 60 meters from her hotel to the venue. That's about 197 feet. (Now that's what I call being particular.)    Overall, it's a pretty fascinating contract. It's amazing what some people require in order to perform. But hey, it's her career, her reputation, and her body, so she can do what she wants."

gossipcop-2194660040,1,0,"First Lady Melania Trump claims there is a secret poisoner in the White House and fears her husband is being slowly poisoned with “heavy sedatives” smuggled into his drinks in an attempt to slow him down, control him, and discredit his presidency, according to reports.  While public debate rages about Donald Trump’s health, Melania has told friends and associates that the once robust and high energy man she knew and loved has been replaced with a “slower, damaged version”.  “By 8pm he is slurring,” she said. “This is not the man I know.”  Fearing that the sedatives are being pumped into the body of the POTUS via Coca-Cola that he orders by pressing a button he had installed on the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, Melania has insisted he stop drinking from the tap and instead revert to drinking from cans she brings herself.  “Donald’s heath improved out of sight when he stopped drinking from the tap,” Melania said.  However the First Lady fears the active campaign to poison the president is “a high level operation” and “not the work of a solitary loon.”  Melania is popular in the White House—as she is with the rest of the country—and she has befriended senior intelligence agency staff who remain loyal to president. They have educated her about Ronald Regan’s poisoning by the Deep State after his assassination attempt in 1981. They have also warned her that George W. Bush was reduced to a “brain damaged” state after years of steady poisoning.  But the advantage Trump may hold over his GOP predecessors in the Oval Office is that he has a wife who is wise to the ruse and is insisting he watch his food and drink intake closely for signs of adulteration.  Donald Trump’s food choices say a lot about the man. The president’s Howard Hughes-level pickiness when it comes to food is partly motivated by a desire to avoid being poisoned, according to Melania. He doesn’t trust those around him – and rightfully so.  As President Trump knows all too well, there are enemies of the state dug in deep at the White House.  Reporters from TIME recently got a glimpse behind-the-scenes at the White House, where they reported on what goes down at the president’s dinner table. Of particular interest was a meal enjoyed by the reporters, Trump, and Vice President Pence.  Pence’s meal was not unusual—he ate what everyone else did. But the POTUS received a meal fully customized to his own preferences, and closely observed by Melania who insisted on watching the chef prepare the meal with ingredients she provided herself.","The White House chefs have been instructed not to add any salt to Trump’s meals, and instead of cream, he is given a dairy-free substitute.  Melania knows what she’s doing when it comes to protecting her husband from the poisoners. The president is reportedly a fan of McDonald’s, but Melania has banned the fast-food favorite from being served in the White House.  The president’s personal White House steak order is well-known – it must be cooked “much more well-done than well-done” and he tops it with a generous amount of ketchup.  But what many don’t know is that Melania has insisted on a specific brand of ketchup being used – the one she knows and trusts.  The First Lady also insists on serving the president his beloved Lay’s potato chips, but only if they are the “salted and vinegary” variety.  She has even banned the president from having his favorite drink, Diet Coke, unless it’s from a can.  Melania has also made it a priority to ensure that the White House pantry is well-stocked with the president’s favorite snacks, such as M&M’s (with the brown ones removed) and Oreos (ditto).  The First Lady’s vigilance in protecting her husband from potential poisoners is evident in every detail of his meals and beverages.  She knows the stakes are high and the risks are real.  She’s not taking any chances."
gossipcop-9067064195,1,0,"Tom Cruise has seemingly been all about his movie career since his high-profile marriage to Katie Holmes met its demise. The action star has steadily starred in film after film, yet has been at the center of several dating rumors.  As the International Business Times reports, “The actor was mistakenly linked to an Australian journalist and then was associated to his Mission: Impossible 6 co-star and Crown actress Vanessa Kirby.”  All rumors until now have been stamped out as false.  However, the latest claims include those stating that members of the Church of Scientology have once again been playing matchmaker for the Top Gun star and that Cruise has reportedly been secretly dating over the past little while. Interestingly enough, Tom has reportedly been using a disguise to enjoy dates with the ladies, much like Katie Holmes did in the initial stages of her romance with Jamie Foxx.  A source told the publication about Cruise’s tactics to keep his love life out of the spotlight.  “Tom’s back on the dating scene, but nobody knows it’s him. His face is way too recognizable for him to stroll into the bars, so he has his makeup artist create a silicone mask. Seems like Tom took his Mission: Impossible role to heart.

If this rumor all sounds a little far-fetched, that’s because it is completely untrue, according to Gossip Cop. Tom Cruise does not go through some elaborate process to secretly step out on dates.

gossipcop-2161541420,1,0,"Kate Hudson Net Worth: Kate Hudson is an American actress who has a net worth of $38 million dollars. Born Kate Garry Hudson on April 19, 1979, in Los Angeles, California, US, she came to prominence in 2001 with her incredible turn in Almost Famous. This role not only made her famous, but it also fetched her a Golden Globe and several nominations, including a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Being a daughter of American actress Goldie Hawn, Hudson bears more than a passing resemblance to her famous mother in both looks and onscreen vivacity. She got the chance to showcase her talent in 1996, when she made her TV debut on Fox's TV series Party of Five (1994-2000). Although she only appeared in one episode titled ""Spring Breaks: Part 1"", this initial experience was enough to uphold her determination to develop a professional acting career in Hollywood. However, it was in 1999 that she started to attract public attention when critics lauded her brilliant portrayal of Cindy in ""200 Cigarettes"", even though the movie itself was a commercial disappointment. Onwards, her career experienced a significant advancement, especially after she managed to obtain a supporting role in ""Gossip"" and ""Dr T and the Women"" which both came up in 2000. While her accolade-worthy performance in Cameron Crowe's Almost Famous indicated that she was set to follow her mother in taking the film industry by storm. In the midst of a whirlwind schedule of fashion shoots and awards shows, she made an appearance in the romantic war drama The Four Feathers in 2002. Turning out to be a box-office failure, Hudson fired back with the surefire hit as she starred opposite quirky heartthrob Matthew McConaughey in the romantic comedy How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003). She continued to establish herself as a fully-fledged actress starring in subsequent productions like Raising Helen (2004), The Skeleton Key (2005), You, Me and Dupree (2006), Fool's Gold (2008) and Bride Wars (2009). As of most recent, she could be seen in the musical comedy-drama television series Glee as Cassandra July.","In addition to her acting career, Kate Hudson has launched her own fitness brand, Fabletics, in 2013, which offers a variety of athletic wear and accessories for women. The brand has since expanded to include a men's line, FL2, as well as a line of activewear for kids. The company continues to grow and now boasts a loyal customer base."

gossipcop-7885025406,1,0,"More than a month has passed since Matt Lauer was fired from the Today show, and his former longtime colleague, Katie Couric, is now opening up about the former NBC anchor’s shocking dismissal.  “The whole thing has been very painful for me,” Couric, 61, tells PEOPLE. “The accounts I’ve read and heard have been disturbing, distressing and disorienting and it’s completely unacceptable that any woman at the Today show experienced this kind of treatment.  “I had no idea this was going on during my tenure or after I left,” she continued. “I think I speak for many of my former colleagues when I say this was not the Matt we knew. Matt was a kind and generous colleague who treated me with respect. In fact, a joke I once made on late-night television was just that, because it was completely contrary to our brother-sister relationship. It’s still very upsetting. I really admire the way Savannah [Guthrie] and Hoda [Kotb] and the entire Today show staff have handled a very difficult situation.”  The late-night show joke that Couric refers to is when she said on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen in 2012 that Lauer “pinches me on the ass a lot.” A clip of the comment made the rounds online in the wake of Lauer’s firing.  Couric spent 15 years co-hosting NBC’s Today show with Lauer, 60, but left in May 2006 to anchor the CBS Evening News.  NBC/Getty  Lauer was fired at the end of November by NBC News after the network received a “detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior,” with reason to believe “this may not have been an isolated incident.” Women have also anonymously accused him of sexual harassment and assault in reports published by Variety and The New York Times.  Following his firing, which was announced live on Today by Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb, Lauer addressed the original allegations in a statement.  “There are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions,” he said, in part. “To the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry. As I am writing this, I realize the depth of the damage and disappointment I have left behind at home and at NBC.”  Although her PEOPLE interview is the first time Couric has spoken in detail about Lauer’s exit, she briefly broke her silence about the scandal on social media in December.  In a short response to an Instagram user, who called Couric out for not publicly addressing the scandal, the veteran journalist said, “It’s incredibly upsetting and I will say something when I’m ready to. Thanks for your interest.”  RELATED VIDEO: Women of Hollywood Attend Golden Globes Together in Support of the Time’s Up Movement  The claims against Lauer came as hundreds of women and men — including Rose McGowan, Ashley Judd, Terry Crews and Anthony Rapp — have publicly came forward about alleged sexual misconduct at the hands of powerful men in Hollywood, including Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey.  The movement inspired the new Time’s Up initiative and legal defense fund that was created to help victims of sexual misconduct pursue legal action against their perpetrators. Time’s Up was a major focus at this year’s Golden Globes, where almost all the famous attendees wore black to raise awareness about the cause.  “I think it was really moving to see so many women support each other and demand change, not only for themselves, but for mistreated and marginalized women in all kinds of industries,” Couric tells PEOPLE about Time’s Up. “Clearly we are witnessing a sea change and a long overdue course correction.”  She also said that one of the new of the episodes of her upcoming six-part documentary Nat Geo series will focus on harassment women have experienced in their workplaces.  “One of my Nat Geo episodes explores the various obstacles that are holding women back in Hollywood, Silicon Valley and beyond,” she says. “I just interviewed Elisabeth Moss about this. Harassment is just one part of the equation.”  RELATED VIDEO: Hoda Kotb and ","Savannah Guthrie on the Today show set [A]fter Matt Lauer was fired, the duo has been anchoring the show together, with Guthrie at the news desk and Kotb sitting alongside her in Lauer’s former spot.  “I’ve known Matt for 15 years, and we’ve worked together every day for the past seven years,” Guthrie told PEOPLE in December. “He’s my dear friend, and my heart breaks for him and his children. But when this happened, my overwhelming feeling was of gratitude for the women who came forward. They made a difference. They’ve changed the conversation, and it’s for the better.”   Kotb, 53, also spoke highly of Guthrie in the wake of Lauer’s dismissal. “Savannah is a class act. She’s been a rock,” Kotb told PEOPLE. “She’s been the glue that’s held everything together. She’s the heart and soul of the Today show.”"

In 2018, Blunt starred alongside her husband, John Krasinski, in the acclaimed horror film A Quiet Place, and will next star as Mary Poppins in the musical fantasy film Mary Poppins Returns. Early life [ edit ] Blunt was born in Wandsworth, London.[5][6] She is the second of four children[7] born to Joanna, a former actress and teacher,[8][9] and barrister Oliver Simon Peter Blunt, QC.[10][11][12] Her siblings are Felicity, Sebastian, and Susannah.[10][13] Her grandfather was Major-General Peter Blunt, and one of her paternal uncles is Crispin Blunt,[14] Conservative Member of Parliament for Reigate. From the age of seven to 14, Blunt struggled with stuttering.[15] She credits a school teacher for helping her overcome the stutter through acting.[16] She went on to sit on the board of directors for the American Institute for Stuttering.[17] Blunt attended Ibstock Place School in Roehampton, southwest London and, at the age of 16, went to Hurtwood House in Dorking, Surrey, a private sixth-form college known for its performing arts programme. There, she was discovered and signed by an agent.[18][not in citation given] Career [ edit ] 2001–2004: Career beginnings [ edit ] In November 2001, Blunt made her professional debut opposite Dame Judi Dench in Sir Peter Hall's production of the play The Royal Family, in which she played the role of the granddaughter Gwen to Dench's Fanny Cavendish. Critic Tom Keatinge hailed the production, writing that ""Peter Hall's direction and Anthony Ward's tremendous set combine with all this to make The Royal Family a terrific night's entertainment"", and that ""it provides a vehicle for acting of the finest quality, with strong performances from the whole ensemble"".[19] For her performance, Blunt was named ""Best Newcomer"" by the Evening Standard.

Blunt was drawn to the film because of its focus on Victoria's early life, rather than the more famous later years that have been extensively covered in other films and television series. ""There's a whole section of her life that no one's really looked at, which is her youth and the early years of her reign, when she was just 18 and 19,"" Blunt said in an interview. ""It's a fascinating, turbulent period, and it's a story that's never been done before.""[28] The film, co-starring Rupert Friend, Mark Strong, and Miranda Richardson, was directed by Jean-Marc Vallée.

gossipcop-8884898167,1,0,"Lady Gaga Alberto E. Rodriguez/ Getty Images  The INSIDER Summary:  Lady Gaga's new documentary will discuss her struggles with chronic pain and fibromyalgia.  The singer has previously spoken about her battle with the disorder on social media.  Fibromyalgia causes widespread pain and is not curable.  In 2016, Lady Gaga revealed an Instagram post is 2016 that she suffers from ""chronic pain"" but never gave more details. But in her upcoming documentary, ""Gaga: Five Foot Two,"" the singer and actress dives a little deeper into the disease she's been battling for some time.  The singer recently tweeted that the chronic pain she deals with is fibromyalgia, a disorder that is more common than people may think. In the tweet, she wrote that she wants to, "" help raise awareness and connect people who have it,"" CNN reports.  Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain disorder that causes tenderness to touch or pain over the body.  According to the National Fibromyalgia & Chronic Pain Association, the disease can vary in intensity and affects people ""physically, mentally, and socially."" People suffering from this disorder, which often manifests itself in adolescence or young adulthood, feel more pain than would be typically expected. Because of this pain, a few common symptoms include fatigue, tenderness, sleep disorders, memory problems, depression, and stiffness.  The foundation also reports that 10 million Americans suffer from fibromyalgia with a ratio of eight to two ratio, women over men.  There is no cure for this pain, and it is a lifelong condition.  The disease can occur on its own but has also been linked to stress, repetitive injuries, and other diseases like Lupus, according to the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases. Researchers are working to determine definitively what causes people to develop this pain in the hopes of finding a cure or better treatment options.  Healthline reports that treatment typically goes beyond medication and focuses on improving quality of life through self-care and lifestyle changes. Medication options vary from antidepressants and sleep aids to pain relievers and narcolepsy drugs.  Other celebs have opened up about their struggle with chronic pain or fibromyalgia.  George Clooney Getty Images/Chip Somodevilla  In addition to Gaga, Morgan Freeman has specifically spoken about dealing with fibromyalgia. In an interview with Esquire, the actor described the pain.

The actor doesn't let this pain stop him from doing some of the things he enjoys like golfing or walking, but he can't fly pilot jets or drive.  According to ABC, other stars that have suffered from chronic pain include Paula Abdul, George Clooney, and Tobey Maguire.  In a press conference, Gaga said that the ""pain is a microphone"" and it ""does me no good unless I transform it into something that is,"" Variety reports. Here's hoping ""Gaga: Five Foot Two,"" which will be available on September 22 on Netflix, inspires others suffering to transform the pain.",The singer has used her platform to raise awareness about chronic pain and fibromyalgia.  It is a great way to educate the public and let them know about this disease.  The documentary will provide a glimpse into the life of the singer and her struggles with chronic pain and fibromyalgia.  It is a good way to understand the disease and how it affects people's lives.
gossipcop-8106461875,1,0,"Absurdly Driven looks at the world of business with a skeptical eye and a firmly rooted tongue in cheek.  People are always saying unflattering things about you.  Even if you're the Pope.  The only time it can affect you, however, is when you hear about it.  Or, worse, if someone makes the unpleasant comment directly to you.  Which brings us, quite naturally, to Twitter.  Here's a place that's just too perfect for the nasty, uncontrolled insult.  You can hide behind your egg and toss Bons-Molotovs at anyone you choose.  Some people choose Kim Kardashian.  She's an easy target.  Her life seems effortless. She's painfully wealthy, with a TV show, branded products left and right and an appearance fee surely only rivaled by Hillary Clinton.  Hers is such a cushy life that she can listen to Kanye West any time she wants.  Small wonder, then, that a Twitter user called Kevin James offered a wry dig at her countenance.  Is it me, or is @KimKardashian Sooo Self-absorbed.. even when she's saying Nothing.. lol.. & I Like the Kardashians #KUWTK -- Kevin James (@kevinjames4good) January 22, 2018  If you've ever been attacked on Twitter, you have choices.  You can reply aggressively. This is rarely worth it with a troll.  You can ignore it and even block the person who directed their bile your way.  You can wait for your own fans to descend upon this poor individual and shred him from tweet to tweet.  Or, you can be splendidly disarming.  This last path was the one taken by Kardashian.  No it's not you, I totally am! https://t.co/9ZxgPyVkko -- Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) January 22, 2018  Not everyone can pull this off with a straight face.  But here, Kardashian showed she understood the emotional essence of her interlocutor.  His biggest problem was surely that he isn't Kim Kardashian.  So she brought him onto her side with something so blessedly charming that it not only made her seem entirely self-aware -- rather than merely self-absorbed -- but also must have enticed a chuckle from Kevin James himself.  Indeed, it incited James to respond with quite considered contrition.  @KimKardashian Listen: altho my tweet came across ""seemingly"" disrespectful, it was just a thought/tweet worthy reaction.. lol... No DisRespect.. .. & I Appreciate ur Sense of humor, & @cassbrunelle14 for calling me out.. lol.. props to the Kardashian Empire -- Kevin James (@kevinjames4good) January 22, 2018  And so, without a word of insult, without so much as a miffed gesture, Kardashian took a situation that could have been emotionally straining and turned it into one the most pleasant feelings we have: laughter.  We'd all love to have that skill.  On truly good days, we find it.  On most other days, we walk away from a tense situation and only then do we start kicking ourselves that we didn't react a different way.  Harnessing it surely takes practice. A lot of practice.  Something Kardashian has surely done.","The world is a mean place.  The internet, even meaner.  But in this one small moment, Kim Kardashian was the best of us.  She turned a sneer into a smile.

It’s been more than two years since Blake Shelton, 40, and Miranda Lambert, 33, ended their marriage, but she’s finally ready to sit down and hash things out, according to a new report. Amidst new rumors that Blake is having trouble in his relationship with Gwen Stefani, 47, an insider tells InTouch that Miranda wants to confront her ex to finally get closure. “It needs to be done,” the source tells the mag. “There’s still a lot of unfinished business between [Miranda] and Blake. She needs to look straight into Blake’s eyes, ask certain questions, and get answers.”  There are no plans set for this meeting to actually take place just yet, but the mag claims that if it does happen, Miranda plans to go in with a “clear head,” although that might not be so easy. “This could get heated,” the insider admits. “As soon as the emotions come up, [Miranda] may lose it.” This doesn’t mean the 33-year-old wants to get back together with her ex, though — actually, it’s just the opposite. She’s very happy with her man, Anderson East, 29, but feels a face-to-face with Blake is what she needs to fully be ready to commit to another relationship, according to the source.  “She feels that [she and Blake] have both grown so much since their divorce that meeting up is essential for them to have healthy relationships in the future,” InTouch’s insider says. “Who knows, maybe this meeting with Blake will have them walk away as friends. Either way, they’ll definitely be in a better place.”  As for the rumored trouble between Blake and Gwen, we’re going to take that report (from OK! magazine) with a grain of salt.

In a blow to Kris’ ego, it’s believed that Corey, Justin Bieber’s former road manager, initiated their break-up.  ‘She had been nagging him about a number of things for a while, including the fact that he wasn’t spending as much time with her as she’d like, and he just couldn’t take it anymore,' says Star’s source, who adds that Kris is devastated.  ‘She can’t stand to be alone. But I suspect she and Corey may have actually put on a united front in public for some time, since ratings have been way down for Keeping Up With The Kardashians.

gossipcop-5658990975,1,0,"Daniel Craig is returning as James Bond once again, even as he reportedly fights to save his marriage to Rachel Weisz at the same time. Craig has already announced his intent to return as 007 in the franchise’s 25th film, and according to the National Enquirer, he’s still struggling to salvage what’s left of his marriage.  The Enquirer’s source claimed at the beginning of 2017, “Rachel and Daniel haven’t been happy for a while, and nearly called it quits last year.” The report claims that the married couple was in two separate filming locations at the beginning of the year, but continued to stay apart even after wrapping their respective films. The Enquirer then claims that they finally reunited in July after not being seen together in ‘554 days’.  According to the sources, the minute the outlet attempted to lock down an exclusive on the couple’s rocky marriage, both Rachel Weisz and Daniel Craig were seen arriving at New York’s Public Theater the next day, prompting the source to add, “The whole thing just seemed like too much of a coincidence. I don’t buy it for a minute.”  When you consider Daniel Craig’s own words, especially in the context of allegedly turning down a $150 million payday to star in two more James Bond films, he had stated, “Being on your own would be sad, sick, and weird. I don’t trust myself. I need that balance.” If these reports are to be believed, then Daniel Craig previously turned down starring in more Bond films to spend time with his family, but now – all of a sudden – he’s back to working on James Bond?  Either the report was never accurate to begin with, or he’s giving up on his marriage to Rachel Weisz. One would hope that the two have worked out whatever was troubling them in the first place, but given their own relationship and marriage histories – and how they’ve both jumped ship on long-term relationships at the drop of a hat – one wouldn’t be faulted for assuming that they are on their way to getting a divorce.  What do you guys think? Are Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz having marriage troubles, and is Daniel’s decision to take on the role of 007 again an indication that he’s giving up on his marriage? Or just a chance to have more career stability and/or cash in on a major paycheck? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.  Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images for Sony Pictures",Entertainment
gossipcop-4774142356,1,0,"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired.

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email  Meghan Markle’s childhood best friend has revealed the real reason her first marriage broke up - and it wasn't a mutual decision.  Childhood pal Ninaki Priddy opened up about Prince Harry's fiancée, claiming her desire to be famous outweighed her commitment to her marriage to film producer Trevor Engelson.  Meghan married her ex back in 2011 on a Jamaican beach. They split two years later after she landed her role in Suits, which filmed in Toronto. Previously it was thought the pair grew apart after Meghan spent months filming in Canada and her beau was based in LA.  Ninaki says otherwise.  (Image: Getty Images North America)  (Image: REX/Shutterstock)  ""The way she handled it, Trevor definitely had the rug pulled out from under him. He was hurt,"" she said, explaining that while Trevor was heartbroken, Meghan was less affected,"" she told Mail Online.  Prior to their split, Ninaki - who was maid of honour at the wedding - said the pair doted on each other and Trevor would have done anything for the actress.  ""Then, after the wedding, it was like a light switched off. There’s Meghan before fame and Meghan after fame. After three seasons of Suits, she called me to say the marriage was over.  The pair first met aged two at Hollywood’s private Little Red School House before they went to the Immaculate Heart girls’ high school in Los Angeles at the age of 11.  Following a close friendship that she describes as 'sisterly', Ninaki says the pair eventually fell out over how Meghan and ex-husband - who the ex Suits star met when she was just 23 - split.  She explains she went to visit Trevor who was heartbroken over their split, while Meghan seemed less affected.  (Image: Instagram)  Elsewhere, Ninaki said her former best friend, who quit Suits to pursue a life with Harry, always wanted to be famous.

""We used to imagine her receiving an Oscar. She used to practise announcing herself.""  While talking about her relationship with Harry and her role as a future royal, Ninaki claims Meghan was always very aware of the Royal Family - despite the actress claiming she knew little about Harry when they met.  ""I think it’s a very fanciful dream to believe that you just walk into a Prince Charming.  ""I know the Royal Family was something she found fascinating. She had one of Princess Diana’s books [Diana: Her True Story] on her bookshelf, and even when she was with Trevor she told me she wanted to go and stay in London for at least a month.""  She added: ""I wasn’t shocked or even surprised to hear about Prince Harry. I know she used to love The Princess Diaries — films about a commoner who becomes part of a Royal Family. She was very taken with that idea.""","However, Ninaki still has love for her former friend and is proud of what she has achieved.  ""I’m not hurt or anything. I’m happy for her. I just think it’s interesting how different people can remember things differently,"" she said.  ""I’m not bitter or angry. I wish her the best, and I’m not going to dredge up anything from her past. I’m happy to be here for her if she needs me."""

She has received an Academy Award, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, and three Golden Globe Awards, and has been cited as Hollywood's highest-paid actress. Jolie made her screen debut as a child alongside her father, Jon Voight, in Lookin' to Get Out (1982). Her film career began in earnest a decade later with the low-budget production Cyborg 2 (1993), followed by her first leading role in a major film, Hackers (1995). She starred in the critically acclaimed biographical cable films George Wallace (1997) and Gia (1998), and won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the drama Girl, Interrupted (1999). Jolie's starring role as the video game heroine Lara Croft in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) established her as a leading Hollywood actress. She continued her successful action-star career with Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), Wanted (2008), and Salt (2010), and received critical acclaim for her performances in the dramas A Mighty Heart (2007) and Changeling (2008), which earned her a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actress. Her biggest commercial success came with the fantasy picture Maleficent (2014). In the 2010s, Jolie expanded her career into directing, screenwriting, and producing, with In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011), Unbroken (2014), By the Sea (2015), and First They Killed My Father (2017). In addition to her film career, Jolie is noted for her humanitarian efforts, for which she has received a Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award and an honorary damehood of the Order of St Michael and St George (DCMG), among other honors. She promotes various causes, including conservation, education, and women's rights, and is most noted for her advocacy on behalf of refugees as a Special Envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). As a public figure, Jolie has been cited as one of the most influential and powerful people in the American entertainment industry. For a number of years, she was cited as the world's most beautiful woman by various media outlets, and her personal life is the subject of wide publicity. Divorced from actors Jonny Lee Miller and Billy Bob Thornton, she separated from her third husband, actor Brad Pitt, in September 2016. They have six children together, three of whom were adopted internationally. Early life and family Born in Los Angeles, California, Jolie is the daughter of actors Jon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand. She is the sister of actor James Haven, and the niece of singer-songwriter Chip Taylor[2] and geologist and volcanologist Barry Voight.[3] Her godparents are actors Jacqueline Bisset and Maximilian Schell.[4] On her father's side, Jolie is of German and Slovak descent,[5][6] and on her mother's side, she is of primarily French Canadian, Dutch, and German ancestry.[5] Like her mother, Jolie has stated that she is part Iroquois,[7] although her only known indigenous ancestors were 17th-century Hurons.[5][8] After her parents' separation in 1976, Jolie and her brother lived with their mother, who had abandoned her acting ambitions to focus on raising her children.[9] Her mother raised her Catholic, but did not require her to go to church.[10] As a child, she often watched films with her mother and it was this, rather than her father's successful career, that inspired her interest in acting,[11] though at age five she had a bit part in Voight's Lookin' to Get Out (1982).[12] When Jolie was six years old, Bertrand and her live-in partner, filmmaker Bill Day, moved the family to Palisades, New York;[13] they returned to Los Angeles five years later.[9] Jolie then decided she wanted to act and enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she trained for two years and appeared in several stage productions. Jolie first attended Beverly Hills High School, ","Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001), but their relationship again deteriorated after Voight publicly criticized Jolie's mother, Bertrand, in 2002, saying she had not been a good mother.[24] In 2003, Jolie's mother died of ovarian cancer, and in the years that followed, Jolie's focus shifted toward her humanitarian efforts, which she discussed in a 2014 New York Times editorial, writing, ""We all lose our mothers too early.""[25] Jolie has stated that she does not want her children to have the same issues with her that she had with her father, and has prevented Voight from meeting his grandchildren.[26] Despite this, Jolie has stated that she views Voight as a part of her family and has said, ""I don't want to be in a position where I'm not honoring him.""[27]"

gossipcop-1105091447,1,0,"Ed Sheeran did not “break” the “friendship code” with Taylor Swift, despite a ridiculous report about Katy Perry. Gossip Cop can reveal what’s going on.  “Ed Sheeran Gushes Over Taylor Swift’s Nemesis Katy Perry — Breaking Friend Code?” asks the pot-stirrers at HollywoodLife. The webloid writes, “Cover your ears, Taylor Swift! The singer’s longtime BFF, Ed Sheeran, crashed her nemesis, Katy Perry’s, BBC Radio 1 interview on Feb. 22… and he had nothing but great things to say about the 32-year-old.”  The site goes on to say, “So, of course, we have to wonder how Taylor feels about this — although she’s never confirmed it, Katy is totally the subject of her song ‘Bad Blood,’ and their feud has played out in the public eye since 2014. Ed may be getting a phone call from his bestie sometime soon…”","The truth, however, is that Sheeran and Perry have been friends for years, long before Swift and Perry’s alleged falling out. In fact, Sheeran and Perry collaborated on her 2017 album, “Witness,” and have performed together on several occasions. It’s not surprising that Sheeran would have kind words to say about Perry, and there’s no indication that Swift is upset about it.  In short, HollywoodLife is trying to create a non-existent drama where none exists.  There’s no “friendship code” being broken here, just a longtime friendship between Sheeran and Perry that predates any issues between Swift and Perry."

gossipcop-7658353025,1,0,"“A Star Is Born” is that thing we always yearn for but so rarely get to see: a transcendent Hollywood movie. It’s the fourth remake of a story that dates back to 1932, but this one has a look and vibe all its own — rapturous and swooning, but also delicate and intimate and luminous. It’s set in the present day, but in spirit it’s a sophisticated retro ’70s drama built around the uncanny flow of feeling that develops between the movie’s two stars: Bradley Cooper, who plays Jackson Maine, a hard-drinking, bad-ol’-boy redneck rock ‘n’ roller who is still hanging on as a popular attraction but has lost the lust for what he’s doing, and Lady Gaga, in her fetching and accomplished movie-star debut, as Ally, an ingenuous, fresh-faced singer-songwriter who becomes his lover and stage partner before rocketing on her own into the new pop stratosphere. She takes off as he slowly crashes — that’s the soapy tragic “Star Is Born” concept. But what the movie does is to take this fabled melodramatic romantic seesaw and turn it into something indelibly heartfelt and revealing. Cooper directed the movie himself, working from a script he co-wrote with Eric Roth and Will Fetters, and to say that he does a good job would be to understate his accomplishment. As a filmmaker, Bradley Cooper gets right onto the high wire, staging scenes that take their time and play out with a shaggy intimacy that’s shorn of the usual “beats.” The new “Star Is Born” is a total emotional knockout, but it’s also a movie that gets you to believe, at every step, in the complicated rapture of the story it’s telling. More Reviews Venice Film review: 'Isis, Tomorrow. The Lost Souls of Mosul' Telluride Film Review: 'They'll Love Me When I'm Dead' The 1976 version, starring Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson, had some terrific cornball love songs, but they didn’t belong anywhere near the stadium-rock stage, and neither did Streisand, which is part of why the movie came off as borderline ludicrous. It seemed stranded, with a kind of campy sincere ineptitude, between three worlds: Old Hollywood, New Hollywood, and Barbra Streisand rock-princess fantasy. But from the electrifying opening moments of the new version, in which Jackson, boozy and raw, with his sunburned squint and hard-bitten shit-kicker sexiness, takes the stage of a gigantic stadium and launches into a grinding slow rocker that sounds like “Victim of Love”-era Eagles as done by the Allman Brothers, the movie is thrillingly authentic. That’s no minor accomplishment. Hollywood almost never succeeds in nailing the rock world, but “A Star Is Born,” though a love story through and through, is the most lived-in rock ‘n’ roll movie since “Almost Famous.” And that absolute looks right, sounds right, feels right verisimilitude sets the stage for everything that follows. Jackson, who looks to be in his mid-40s, has been around long enough that he now occupies a grey zone between legend and nostalgia. He can still fill an arena full of screaming fans, and his old hits have become classic-rock chestnuts, but his sound and persona have long slipped out of the zeitgeist. His whole outlaw look — the beard and rancher’s hat, the Kristofferson-meets-Skynyrd soused macho twinkle — mark him as a charismatic relic, and the grand irony is this: What that look, and sound, are all about is an era when rock ‘n’ roll strutted its “authenticity,” but now that he’s out of date, Jackson’s authenticity looks more than ever like a showbiz conceit, frozen in amber. It’s a part he’s playing, an image he’s working — and secretly struggling — to keep alive. He’s got a signature ballad that goes “Maybe it’s time to let the old ways die,” and when he wrote it (long ago), he probably didn’t know that he was talking about himself. In the first of many telling jump cuts, the film leaps from his on-stage glory to Jackson slinking into the back of his car, weary and alone, grabbing the bottle of gin he’s got stashed there. He takes a guzzle, and Coop",", she’s washed off the makeup, let down her hair, and changed into a flouncy retro dress. It’s her “real” self, and she’s nervous about meeting the famous guy who just asked her out. It’s a lovely touch, because it’s not just that Ally has an alter ego; it’s that she, like Jackson, is playing a part, trying to figure out how to be a star. But the movie doesn’t push that metaphor too hard. It’s not about performers losing themselves in their personas; it’s about them finding each other in their art. That’s the romantic magic of “A Star Is Born”: Ally and Jackson are two artists who can see into each other’s souls because they both know what it’s like to be a fraud and a genius, a fake and a legend, all at once. They don’t have to put on airs with each other. They can just be. And that’s what makes their love story so piercingly bittersweet. The two leads are so astonishingly good together that they make you believe, as Ally and Jackson do, that their love is a force of nature. They’re not just creating a character or playing a part. They’re living it."

Brad keeps telling friends that he’s seeing everything more clearly.”  However, these realisations are obviously far too late. Jennifer has been married to Wanderlust co-star Justin Theroux for two years now.  And while Brad would “never dream of” ruining his ex’s new marriage, he “would take a second chance at love with Jen in a heartbeat.”  If they can’t be romantic partners, though, the War Machine star wants Jen to be his partner in other pursuits, In Touch further reported.  Brad Pitt “much happier” following split from Angelina Jolie  “They worked well together” when they formed the production company Plan B in 2001, an insider close to Brad told In Touch. “He wants Jen involved again as he produces and develops more and more high-quality film and cable TV products.”  That kind of professional partnership could pay off for Jen, too, since the insider states she wants in on “prestige projects” under his production banner. “She’d be beyond thrilled to win an Academy Award for Best Actress — something that’s evaded both her and Angelina.”  “He still considers Jen the love of his life,” the source concluded.

gossipcop-6061862691,1,0,"UPDATED: Musicians mourned the loss of rock icon Tom Petty with an outpouring of tributes on social media.  The Gainesville, Fla., native suffered a heart attack Sunday at his home in Malibu, Calif. He was transferred to UCLA Medical Center-Santa Monica, where he was on life support until he died Monday evening at age 66.  Although Petty’s actual time of death was 8:40 p.m. PT on Monday, several media outlets reported that Petty had died earlier in the day, leading to a premature wave of statements and tributes. At his time of death, Petty was “surrounded by family, his bandmates, and friends,” according to Tony Dimitriades, the longtime manager of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.  “It’s shocking, crushing news,” Bob Dylan said in a statement. “I thought the world of Tom. He was a great performer, full of the light, a friend, and I’ll never forget him.”  Longtime friend and collaborator Jeff Lynne said simply: “Tom Petty was the coolest guy I ever knew.”  “This is unbearable,” Sheryl Crow wrote on Twitter. “Vegas and now a great music hero has passed.

gossipcop-5592793027,1,0,"Gary Null/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images Jennifer Aniston as Rachel Green and Lisa Kudrow as Phoebe Buffay during the filming of the “Friends” episode “The One with Ross's Wedding: Part 1” in 1998.  Lisa Kudrow has offered up even more proof that the cast of “Friends” took the name of the beloved sitcom to heart.  On Monday, the actress told People that her co-stars altered a pre-show ritual when she was pregnant during Seasons 4 and 5 to include her unborn child — her now 20-year-old son, Julian Murray Stern.  “The six of us would do a huddle backstage and just say, ‘All right, have a good show, love you love you love you love you,’” Kudrow, 55, told the outlet. “And when I was pregnant, then they would say, ‘Have a great show, love you love you — love you, little Julian!’ ’Cause we knew it was a boy and that was his name.”  She added: “So sweet, they included my little fetus in the huddle.”  The stars of “Friends” embraced one another’s children at other times, too. In 2005, Jennifer Aniston was named godmother of Courteney Cox’s daughter, Coco Arquette.","Kudrow also spoke about the group text chain that she, Aniston, Cox, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry, and David Schwimmer have to keep in touch.  “We all have different text chains, but we have a group text chain, too, so we can all talk at the same time,” she said.  “We’re in a group text with each other.

The obvious answer is that Justin and Hailey are in love and want to spend forever together, but there's also a rumor lurking in some corners of the internet (read: Twitter) claiming that Hailey's pregnant. Which, to be clear, is definitely not anyone's business, and is also pretty sexist!

gossipcop-1716370499,1,0,"Dakota Johnson; most of us know her as the actress from Fifty Shades of Grey. While we may have seen Johnson in some pretty intimate positions on-screen, there’s definitely a lot we don’t know about the Fifty Shades star. Like, for instance, the superfluity of familiar names in her family tree. Seeing that her popular movie, Fifty Shades Darker came out on the day of love—Valentine's Day—it's only fitting to dedicate a piece to the actress who brought us the sexy and quaint, Anastasia Steele. Johnson, after all, has become somewhat something of a Valentine’s Day staple, herself. Here are 15 facts about Dakota Johnson or, as some might call her, ""that girl from Fifty Shades of Grey."" We guarantee that she will no longer by ""that girl"" by the end of the list! 15 Her Family Tree Is Full Of Famous Faces You know how we said there are a few familiar names in her family tree? Well, we weren’t lying. Her parents are fellow actors, Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson. Unfortunately, her parents divorced in 1994 so Dakota had to split her time between the two. ""It was the only way that I could be with them,"" she said in an interview for Cosmopolitan. ""And since they were divorced, I would spend two weeks with one and two weeks with the other, traveling with a tutor."" But wait, it gets better. Her maternal grandmother (can you guess..) is Hitchcock actress Tippi Hedren. Yes, that’s right, so clearly creative talent lies in that family. We’ve never heard of a family tree with so many famous names! Thanksgiving is probably a whirlwind. Now, Dakota Johnson is another famous name in that tree. 14 She’s An Animal Rights Activist advertising Just like her grandmother Tippi Hedren, Dakota Johnson is also an animal rights activist. Like grandmother, like granddaughter shall we say? As animal lovers ourselves, we’re pleased to hear that she’s following in her grandmother’s footsteps—both in acting and in animal rights. In 2014, Johnson saved 12 horses from being slaughtered by paying for them. What a sweet thing to do! We bet her grandmother was really proud. It’s always so great to hear about celebrities doing positive things - so naturally, we’re happy to hear of Dakota’s compassionate side. We admit we have a soft spot for animal lovers, but who doesn't? We always love hearing about people doing good deeds for animals and it’s always nice to hear celebrities using their celebrity title for the better. 13 She Grew Up Shooting Guns And Riding Horses In Colorado She may play the innocent and naive Anastasia Steele in the Fifty Shades movies, but growing up Johnson was anything but naive. She grew up in Colorado at her dad’s house, where she learned to build a fire, ride a horse, ride motorbikes, and even shoot a gun. And this was all before she was just 10 years old! Sounds like a badass kid to us! But when she wasn’t at her father’s house, she was at her mom’s house in L.A. which she also loved. It's hard to imagine a 10 year old these days shooting guns, riding motorbikes, or building fires without being grounded. But it sounds like she had a pretty inspiring and freeing childhood which makes us fall for the actress all the more. 12 She Never Dates advertising By the header, we mean she never has casual relationships. She only has long-term relationships. Good for her, is all we can say! You hear of so many celebrities who are constantly dating other celebrities. You can barely keep up with who they’re dating these days. It seems to be one guy or girl after another. So it’s great to hear of Dakota’s conservative views on relationships. Apparently she’s only ever been in long-term, serious relationships; she doesn’t just date. That probably explains why she’s been in a relationship with model Matthew Hitt since 2014. Yes, it’s been a kind of an on-and-off relationship but they’ve been in it for the long haul so far. So, to sum up, we like her whole dating attitude. The commitment is great and saves you a lot of time. 11 She HATED School It seems l","us, even the famous ones. 9 She’s Superstitious advertising Did you know that Dakota Johnson is superstitious? Yeah, us neither. But it turns out that she has a few strange superstitions. She doesn’t walk under ladders, she doesn’t put shoes on the table, and she doesn’t break mirrors. She also won’t say the name of Shakespeare’s play Macbeth. Instead, she refers to it as ""The Scottish Play."" Wow, she must be really superstitious if she won’t even say the name of a play. We wonder if any of these superstitions have helped or hindered her career. Maybe she thinks it’s the reason she got the role of Anastasia Steele? We’ll never know. But it’s still interesting to see how some people put so much faith in superstitions. 8 She’s Got A Twin Brother advertising Believe it or not, Dakota Johnson has a twin brother named Jesse Johnson. Jesse is a musician and an actor, and he’s also in a band called The Night Terrors of 1927. The band has released two albums and has toured with some big names like Tegan and Sara. It’s always fascinating to see how siblings of famous people live their lives. Sometimes they’re also famous, sometimes they’re not. In this case, Jesse is also in the entertainment industry, but not as famous as his sister Dakota. But hey, who knows? Maybe one day he’ll be the next big thing. Only time will tell. 7 She Almost Quit Acting Before Fifty Shades Of Grey advertising Can you imagine a world without Dakota Johnson as Anastasia Steele? It almost happened. Before she landed the role in Fifty Shades of Grey, Johnson considered quitting acting altogether. She had been struggling to find meaningful roles and was starting to lose faith in her career. But then she got the role of a lifetime, and the rest, as they say, is history. The Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy has made her a household name and a global sensation. It’s amazing how one role can change everything, and it’s great that Johnson didn’t give up on her dream. If she hadn’t gotten the role, who knows what she would be doing now? Maybe she’d be pursuing a different career or maybe she’d still be acting. We’ll never know, but"
gossipcop-9811720113,1,0,"I, at least, struggle to understand her career. Her performance as a junkie in “The Town” features the “Bride Wars” of Boston accents. Her performance in “The Age of Adaline” — as a woman “cursed” to stay 30 forever — was like watching a mermaid ride a bike. She tries. But her acting hasn’t yet caught up to her algorithm-generated beauty. Alas, there may be no algorithmic solution for that.  So I was less than psyched at the prospect of seeing her shiver on a buoy, stitch her own wounds, talk to animals or play a Nancy. And, as refreshing as it is watching her stand on a surfboard, it’s refreshment that provides some perspective. While some actors make sense on movie screens, there are others who might make better sense on a can of something — beer, beans, air. I can hear you, Hudson skeptics. And all I can say is that the heart wants what the heart wants. I’d actually buy whatever Ms. Hudson was on the can of.  There might be no appreciable industrial difference between what a Kate Hudson can do versus your Blake Livelys. I don’t think they’re interchangeable, but sometimes the movies beg to differ, and the market corrects itself. Don’t fall in love with Mark Harmon, because here comes Kevin Costner. And sell your Brad Rowe stock, because he’s just going to be replaced by Brad Pitt. (In the late 1990s, that pretty much happened.) But there are continuums, too. Channing Tatum, for instance, is a more elastic, hip-hop-era Brendan Fraser upgrade.  Lots of parts that have gone to Ms. Lively feel as if Ms. Hudson could have played them. But something happened, and suddenly it was someone else’s turn to be “it.” (It’s always someone else’s turn.) And part of what annoys me about the lack of Kate Hudson in my life and the surfeit of Ms. Lively is the same thing that makes me angry when a perfectly good piece of software gets a superfluous update, or a zealous waiter takes my plate at a restaurant: I wasn’t done with that.","So it’s not just that Ms. Lively is a fine actress. It’s that she’s a fine actress who is, for some reason, it. And Kate Hudson, who seemed to be it for a moment, isn’t. And I have to remember to just accept that, because the heart wants what it wants, and Kate Hudson is not the only thing I can’t have."
gossipcop-178000221,1,0,"Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge wasn’t always a royal, but even before her marriage to Prince William, Kate Middleton had an impressive net worth.  Middleton had a comfortable upbringing before she became the first commoner to join the royal family after she married William in 2011. But Middleton’s net worth ballooned once she became a duchess.  Here’s everything we know about Middleton’s net worth:  What is Kate Middleton’s net worth?  The 36 year-old mother of three — who gave birth to a second baby boy in April — is worth at least £5 million, or $7 million, according to global wealth-tracking firm Wealth-X, though some estimates put her net worth as high as £7.3 million, or $10 million. Middleton’s wealth is mostly in cash because she doesn’t have a personal portfolio of property or artwork.  That being said, Middleton’s net worth is a lot less than her prince — Wealth-X estimates Prince William’s net worth is at least $30 million, though some reports put his fortune closer to $40 million. According to Wealth-X, $19 million of Prince William’s wealth is in cash. The wealth tracking firm also noted that William has an expensive helicopter fit for a royal — an Augusta A109S Grand helicopter which is valued at $11 million.  Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, Prince George of Cambridge and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge arrive for a children's party for Military families during the Royal Tour of Canada on September 29, 2016 in Victoria, Canada. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  What do we know about Kate Middleton’s money?  Most of Middleton’s net worth stems from Party Pieces, an online party supplies business started by her parents. The company is estimated to be worth around £30 million, or $50 million, thanks in no small part to the exposure it gets from being associated with the royals, according to royal expert Marlene Koenig.  Prior to her life as a full-time duchess, Middleton worked for the family business and was a part-time accessories buyer for a retailer called Jigsaw.  Growing up, Kate and her two siblings, Pippa and James Middleton, attended expensive privates schools from a young age, with years of tuition for just one child estimated to be at least £250,000, or $350,000. Kate met Prince William while in college in Scotland at the prestigious University of St. Andrew’s. She graduated in 2005 with a degree in Art History.  How did Kate Middleton’s net worth change after marrying Prince William?  Joining the royal family meant that Middleton was marrying into an incredible $88 billion fortune amassed over generations.  Before Will and Kate became the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and moved into a 20-room apartment in Kensington Palace, Kate lived in an apartment purchased by her parents in the Chelsea neighborhood of London believed to be worth £1 million, or $1.4 million.  Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge smile following their marriage at Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011 in London, England. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  But once Kate officially became a royal she didn’t need to spend much of her own money anymore. Most of her living costs are covered by the private estate Prince Charles manages, the Duchy of Cornwall. The revenue from the Duchy of Cornwall pays for the most of Prince Charles and his family’s royal expenses: things like official travel, wardrobe, housing and staff costs. When Meghan Markle marries Prince Harry on May 19, she too, will get to keep most of her own money — her net worth is believed to be about $5 million — as the Duchy of Cornwall will also absorb the majority of her living costs associated with royal responsibilities.  What is the ‘Kate effect’?  As the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate sets fashion trends all over the world. While she herself does not retain any income from the flurry of economic activity set off by the designer clothes she wears for public appearances, she has triggered what is known as “the Kate Effect,” ","which boosts the sales of the brands she wears.  According to branding expert Nigel Currie, the Kate Effect is worth about $1 billion to the British economy. When she wears a certain dress or brand, it often sells out within hours of her being photographed in it.  Kate Middleton, Duchess of Cambridge, and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge attend the 2018 BAFTA Awards at Royal Albert Hall on February 18, 2018 in London, England. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  Conclusion:  The Duchess of Cambridge’s net worth is quite impressive for a royal who didn’t grow up in the British royal family. But even though her wealth is nothing to sneeze at, it’s significantly less than her husband’s, and of course, a fraction of the overall royal family fortune. As Kate Middleton continues to perform her royal duties, her influence on fashion and the British economy is likely to only grow, meaning her net worth could rise in the future."

Iggy Azalea, 26, knows a lot about heartbreak when it comes to dealing with men. Especially, those who are still connected to their exes. That said, The New Classic artist is trying to get word to Khloe Kardashian, 32, that Tristan Thompson, 25, may break her heart if she’s not careful.  “Iggy’s not trying to be salty or hate on Tristan but she’s hit up French [Montana], and told her he needs to put Khloe up on game and warn her that she’s putting herself at risk for serious heartbreak with him,” a source close to Iggy told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “Iggy explained to French that these basketball players are no joke and don’t care whose heart they break in their quest to bang every girl that breathes.”  “Iggy still feels some type of way after Nick [Young] cheated on her and then on top of that got his baby mama pregnant – again,” the source continued. “She’s sticking to the girl code and would hate for Khloe to experience the same type of pain she did.

gossipcop-5251247668,1,0,"Despite rumors of a split, Rihanna is still very much together with boyfriend of one year Hassan Jameel. We’ve got the pics of their steamy Mexican getaway  Rihanna has kept her one year romance with Saudi billionaire Hassan Jameel super private. So when rumors surfaced in June that they had broken up fans were waiting to see proof they were still a couple. They got it on July 9 when pics surfaced of the 30-year-old singer and the businessman on a sexy Mexican getaway. The two appeared to be locked in a animated conversation as bikini clad RiRi is seen pointing her right index finger in the air with her mouth open, looking like she had something important to say. In another pic Hassan is seen looking back at her with his hand on his chest as if they’re involved in a somewhat heated conversation. CLICK HERE to see all the pics.  On June 1 MediaTakeOut claimed RiRi had dumped Hassan. The site reported that “Rihanna just got tired of him. She gets tired of men sometimes,” an alleged insider told them. They said that the handsome billionaire wasn’t doing too well after the split. “Of course Rihanna broke his heart. That’s what she does — break men’s hearts.” Since Rihanna has never commented on her romance with Hassan and goes to great lengths to keep their relationship away from the public eye, MTO’s report spread like wildfire.  Obviously something is still on between Rihanna and Hassan, as they are having a hot summer together. They were first photographed a year ago making out in a pool in Spain. They’ve only been pictured a handful of times since, keeping their love undercover. The “Work” singer’s previous relationship was with Drake, 31, and it played out in public. He even professed his years of love to her in front of the world while presenting her with the Video Vanguard award at the 2016 VMAs. After having the public know all about their dating business, Ri has wisely kept her romance with Hassan as far out of the public eye as possible.  Rihanna revealed recently that Drake gushing about her on live TV made her cringe. In a May 2018 interview with Vogue, she said “Waiting through that speech was probably the most uncomfortable part. I don’t like too many compliments; I don’t like to be put on blast.” As for where she stands with Drizzy, she told the mag that they haven’t spoken and that “We don’t have a friendship now, but we’re not enemies either. It is what it is.” However she did come the close to discussing her relationship with Hassan, telling the publication that she dating and she is happy. “I used to feel guilty about taking personal time,” she revealed, “but I also think I never met someone who was worth it before,” she said about her romance with Hassan.",So it seems that Rihanna has moved on from her public love affairs and found happiness in a private relationship.

The talk show host on Sunday posted a photo on Instagram of him and his wife boarding a private jet.  “Vacation time is here, let’s go girl,” he captioned the Sunday, July 8 image.  The photo, which was similar to one Marjorie posted on her Instagram Story, got praise from fans.  “God bless….. stay focus[ed] don’t [lose] the vision🙏💍.”  “Enjoy yourselves, you guys deserve this vacation. Come back well rested and a stronger bond and marriage. Yahoo for the Harveys.”  Days earlier, RadarOnline reported that Marjorie walked out on Steve because he had been getting close with Kris Jenner during closed-door business meetings and ongoing phone calls and text messages.  “There was a huge blowout fight and Marjorie walked out threatening divorce,” a source told the gossip site of the reported split. “There’s no way she was going to put up with Steve hanging around a man-eater like Kris — especially since he’s proven time and again he can’t be trusted.”  Although Jenner was reportedly just stringing Steve along to get tips on TV success, one of his former talk show employes said Marjorie knows her man, who is twice divorced and cheated on both wives with the next.  “Steve has a wandering eye and he loves women!” the ex-worker told Radar anonymously. “He’s cheated during his previous marriages, and Marjorie knows he could do it again. She knows her man’s weakness — knows everything about him! That’s why she watches him so closely.”  The rumor was the talk of Twitter.  “Am I late?? Did everyone know Steve Harvey is being accused of cheating on Marjorie with Kris Jenner?! I didn’t know this 😂.”  “Steve Harvey left his wife to marry Marjorie, his side b—- of 20 years, and now she’s leaving him and running his pockets. Hilarious.

She believes they can figure things out and have a happy life together.”  Two hours after the story was published, Khloe tweeted: “I can’t believe some of the stories people create. Where do they come from and who are these “sources”? Hummmm.”  In fairness, Khloe may not have been referring to this story in particular. But she also may very well have been. You get me?  Khloe still hasn’t directly commented on the Tristan situation, but she certainly has been posting some super-cryptic quotes on her social media, which give us absolutely no insight into what the hell is going on. So that’s fun…  First she tweeted this last week: “You will never ever regret being kind to someone.”  Then when someone commented, “Unless they're ungrateful for it”, she replied, “Never give to get. Always try to give without expectations. Whether that be something tangible or emotional.”  Then yesterday she went on Instagram Stories to write: “Your mind will always believe everything you tell it. Feed it faith. Feed it truth. Feed it with love.”  And then: “Nobody cares about your story until you win. So win.”  Soooooooo, you marrying Tristan or not, Khloe?","The world needs to know!  Anyway, all this drama has made us really, really want to watch Keeping Up with the Kardashians when it returns to TV.  And also, can we talk about how Kris Jenner has been laying super low lately? What’s going on there? Is she just chilling in the shadows, waiting to pounce? We need to know, Kris!  Anyway, let’s all just take a moment to appreciate Khloe’s no-bullshit attitude. She’s a strong, powerful woman, and she’s not here for anyone’s nonsense. And you know what? We totally respect her for it."
gossipcop-2509430407,1,0,"Are wedding bells in the future for Mariah Carey? The iconic singer reportedly popped the question to her bae, Bryan Tanaka, and the two are busy planning their big day!  Did Mariah Carey, 47, have a vision of love when looking at boyfriend Bryan Tanaka, 34, one that left her feeling all sorts of emotions? After deciding that she just can’t let go of this hunk, Mariah reportedly decided to make it happen – an engagement, that is! “Word is Mariah took matters into her own hands,” a source tells OK! magazine, “It was an unusual proposal but it did the trick. She wrote a song about how she wanted Bryan to be her husband and she performed it for him while wearing a sexy, glitzy gown. Then she explained that she’s ready for them to make their relationship official.”  Bryan gave a “hearty yes,” as the insider says, “He couldn’t believe his luck!” It appears Bryan also thinks he and Mariah belong together, and he always wants to be her baby. These two aren’t waiting around for one sweet day to tie the knot. While love takes time, Mariah and Bryan are already busy making wedding plans. “Mariah would love to get married in May at the Grand Wailea Resort in Maui,” the insider told OK!, “where she and Bryan first went public with their romance.” Mariah and Bryan struck up a relationship in late 2016, with Mariah low-key confirming the romance in February 2017 by calling Bryan her “boyfriend.”  Mariah’s “also toying with the idea of a winter wonderland wedding,” the source says. “After all, she is the queen of Christmas!” Could Mariah have the fantasy holiday wedding she’s always wanted, saying “Thank God I found you” to her honey, her all? Whenever Mariah decides to get married, don’t forget about us when it comes to the wedding invitations!  This alleged engagement would be the third time Mariah walked down the aisle, as she was previously married to Tommy Mottola, 68, and Nick Cannon, 37. After dealing with a pair of heartbreakers, MiMi isn’t fooling around, especially when it comes to her $520 million fortune. She’s working on an ironclad prenup, according to OK! magazine. “She’s had tow failed marriages already,” the source says. “She’s not going to take any risks here.” Speaking of Nick, expect to see him during Mariah’s big day.  Nick and Mariah’s twins – son Morocco and daughter Monroe, 6 – will be featured in his wedding, and sources say Mariah’s thinking of asking Nick to walk her down the aisle. “[He] will always be a big part of her life,” the source added. Considering Mariah, Nick and the twins recently made an adorable appearance at the 2018 Kids’ Choice Awards, it makes total sense that Mariah’s ex would be on hand to see her say “I Do” again.","As for Mariah’s engagement, it’s not officially confirmed yet, but we’re keeping our fingers crossed for this power couple."
