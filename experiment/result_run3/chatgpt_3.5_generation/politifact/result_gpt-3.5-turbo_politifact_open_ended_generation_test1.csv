Following a slew of allegations against lawmakers, New York Senator Chuck Schumer has been accused of similar misconduct. While the validity of the accusations remains under investigation, the gravity of the allegations is not lost on lawmakers and the public alike. The culture of sexual harassment and misconduct in political circles must be addressed and eradicated to ensure the safety and respect of all individuals in the workplace. This is a matter of utmost importance and the investigation must be conducted thoroughly and without bias. Only then can we move towards a society in which all individuals are treated with the decency and respect they deserve."

PHEEEEEWWWW, that would have been too much to handle.Houston – It seems new National Rifle Association President (NRA) president Jim Porter may have found himself in a bit of hot water. Not long ago he made his feelings about the Civil War known when he referred to it as the “War of Northern Aggression.” In that same speech he referred to President Obama as a “fake president” and Attorney General Eric Holder as “rabidly un-American.” However none of those remarks that anyone could deem as racist compare to his remarks made at a recent press conference discussing his new leadership role at the NRA.“I’m very proud to be taking the lead here at the NRA. We need to really buckle down and strap on our best arguments to defend what is our God-given rights. No more northern folk tryin’ take away what is rightfully ours. I will not stand by and let some liberal-elitists try to ruin what has made this country great, especially a liberal of, you know, a different breed.”When asked to clarify Porter said,“I don’t have to clarify. You know gall darn well what I mean. In fact, it’s only a matter of time before we can own colored people again. They sure as hell won’t be our leaders. It’s out-right embarrassing. The War of Northern Aggression made it all possible, and you be best to know it’s all gonna change back. I’ll be on the front lines making sure it happens. I don’t want my grandkids growing up taking orders from a colored man. It’s our God-given right to keep them as property and keep them in line.”Several at the NRA, including vice president Wayne LaPierre, have since tried to distance themselves from Porter’s remarks. LaPierre said, “They brought him in over me to try and liven things up, calling me boring and rehearsed. Next time they’d be better off just making me president.”-- ADVERTISEMENT --It’s still unknown if the NRA and Porter will write an apology and retraction to his comments.

This news comes as a relief to many who were concerned about the potentially damaging effects of Porter's statements. The NRA president had faced accusations of racism and bigotry after he referred to Barack Obama as a ""fake president"" and suggested that attorney general Eric Holder was a ""racist black."" However, the investigation conducted by the UI has found that these statements were not only unfounded, but entirely untrue. This development marks a significant victory for proponents of truth and civility in public discourse, and a reminder that even the most powerful individuals are not above the standards of honesty and accountability. The NRA has yet to issue a statement regarding the UI findings, but many are hoping that the organization will take this opportunity to distance itself from Porter's divisive rhetoric and work toward fostering a more inclusive and respectful national dialogue."

In the past two weeks, after receiving a...“NOS” stands for “Novus Ordo Seclorum,” or New World Order. The O has been replaced with a transformed version of Obama’s campaign slogan, with the American flag replaced by flames. There is also an all-seeing eye in the center. It’s pretty clear what the agenda is of this traitor we knew was an American-hating globalist all along:Along with two small islands due east of Virginia just in international waters, Obama’s “team” has now set up massive complexes with billions in equipment and spying technology outside of Washington DC, New York and Los Angeles. Chicago would have been a better choice for population than Washington but if your end game is to launch a military coup in the nation’s capital, those pieces must be deeply embedded in place.How embedded? Obama himself lives within the city limits. He conducts secret meetings with top-ranking officials from both parties and diplomats from around the world in a mansion that is a part of the old Washington tunnel system, built after the British trashed the city and burned down the White House in 1812.The extent of the tunnels is unknown since they remain the property of the US Government and require codeword clearance. There is no map available. Historians have pieced together several of the stops, however, and Tracey Place — along with just about every other building that houses a public official in DC — is on the list.This is no joke, patriots. If Obama’s military comes to your door in yellow Humvees with that emblem on them, they aren’t your friends. Get out of the house and don’t look back. At some point, their population reduction plan will go into effect and older Trump supporters will be the first ones buried in mass graves.","Former US President Barack Obama has been accused of planning a coup against his own government in his retirement years. The startling revelation comes after he received a cryptic message containing the letters ""NOS"" two weeks ago. According to sources close to the former President, Obama has spent recent months poring over intelligence reports and strategizing with like-minded individuals with the aim of establishing a ""New World Order.""

While the exact nature of Obama's plans is not yet clear, many have expressed concern that his actions may threaten the very foundations of American democracy. Some have even suggested that Obama's obsession with power has blinded him to the fact that his actions could have disastrous consequences for the country he once led.

Despite these fears, Obama has remained tight-lipped about his ultimate goals. However, sources say that his coup plans are well-advanced and that he is determined to see them through. It is unclear at this stage how the government will respond to this shocking turn of events, but many observers are calling for swift action to be taken to prevent the former President from undermining the country's political stability."

It has been revealed that the reporting of the incident was riddled with inaccuracies, raising serious concerns about the reliability of news reported by these channels.

Despite the immense responsibility that comes with reporting news, it appears that these channels failed to fact-check and verify the information they were presenting. Instead, they chose to jump to conclusions, spread misinformation and sensationalize the incident without any regard for the truth.

This has led to questions about the quality of journalism and the credibility of mainstream media channels. The public deserves to have access to accurate and unbiased news, and the failure of these channels to deliver on that promise is unacceptable.

The incident serves as a stark reminder of the importance of responsible journalism, and the need for media outlets to uphold the highest standards when reporting on sensitive topics. It is imperative that journalists exercise caution and verify information before reporting it to the public, to avoid creating panic and confusion.

In the wake of this incident, it is high time for mainstream media channels to take a hard look at themselves and their practices. The public deserves better, and it is up to the media to deliver it."

politifact14991,1,0,"Rep. Joe Kennedy III (D-MA) claimed the host-city of his response to President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address, Fall River, Massachusetts was “built by immigrants.”Fact-Check: MOSTLY FALSEWhat is now Fall River was first established in the 1600s by English settlers who were not “immigrants” but colonists. A native-born family, the Bordens ran a mill in what became the town for generations before and after the American revolution. Industrialization began when Col. Joseph Durfee, a native-born Revolutionary War hero built the first factory in 1811. Later, at the end of the 19th Century a wave of immigrants swelled the town’s population. Immigrants, however, never made up a majority of the population of Bristol County, where Fall River lies, even at their early 20th Century peak.","In his response to President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address, Rep. Joe Kennedy III (D-MA) made a bold claim about the host-city of his speech. According to Kennedy, Fall River, Massachusetts was ""built by immigrants."" The congressman's comment comes at a time when the Trump administration has taken an increasingly hard line on immigration policy, with the president advocating for stricter borders and new limits on legal immigration.

Fall River is located in southeastern Massachusetts, and has a long history as a hub of textiles and manufacturing. Over the years, immigrants from all over the world have come to work in the city's mills and factories, with Irish, Portuguese, and French-Canadian immigrants making up large portions of the population at various times.

Kennedy's statement is a reminder that there are many communities throughout the United States that owe their success and prosperity to the hard work and ingenuity of immigrants. It is also a challenge to those who seek to divide Americans based on their country of origin or immigration status. As Kennedy said in his speech, ""Immigrants have been the heart and soul of the American experiment since its inception. They came here, often with nothing, and made themselves a part of something bigger."" It is up to all of us to honor that legacy and continue to build a country that is welcoming and inclusive to all who seek to make it their home."

The order has come from an undisclosed governmental agency, which has demanded that the company reduce its number of white employees by precisely 44.3% over the next five years.

While the exact reasons for this demand are unknown, it has raised concerns about the status of white employees in South Africa, and has led to accusations of reverse discrimination. Many have pointed out that the company will have to let go of some of its most qualified and experienced employees to meet this arbitrary target, which could have a detrimental effect on the company's performance and overall productivity.

Speaking on the issue, representatives of the company have declared their commitment to a fair and diverse workforce, one that values talent, experience, and merit above all else. They have expressed their disappointment over the decision and have called for a more nuanced and inclusive approach to employment and diversity.

At the same time, some activists and academics have argued that this move is a necessary step towards redressing the racial imbalances that have persisted in South Africa for many years. They claim that it is an opportunity for historically disadvantaged groups to gain access to better jobs and opportunities, and that it is part of a larger movement towards a more equitable and just society.

Whatever the merits of this decision, it is clear that it will have far-reaching consequences, both for the company and for the wider society. It will require careful planning, sensitivity, and dialogue, and will require all stakeholders to come together in a spirit of collaboration and understanding. Only then can we truly build a society that is fair, just, and inclusive for all."
politifact14356,1,0,"Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedInGretchen Carlson is renewing her push for an AR-15 ban, firing off a series a tweets further criticizing AR-15. Breitbart News reported that Carlson said that AR-15s are not needed to “hunt or kill deer” and suggested they only serve to enable terrorists to carry out their attacks with greater efficiency. She quoted a December 2015 poll showing majority support for an “assault weapons” ban and said, “I’m with the majority today, taking a stand.”Interestingly, when confronted by Second Amendment supporters on Twitter, Carlson doubled down on her pro-ban stance, claiming that “the fact that you’re even using the Second Amendment as an argument against banning assault weapons shows me you’re ignorant. Don’t you know the 2nd Amendment was written before guns were even invented?”Asked to comment on her tweets, Carlson told Breitbart News that “at one point, I even asked myself what was the use of trying to prove why assault rifles are bad to these people when they clearly don’t possess the most fundamental knowledge of history? I felt like I was trying to teach nuclear physics to someone who’s illiterate. I mean, we have Google and the Internet today. How hard was it to Google ‘the 2nd Amendment of the Constitution of the United States?’ I mean, really.”“And what worried me even more,” she continued, “was the fact that it seemed like every single person that replied to my tweet was under the impression that they were right and I was wrong. So, I’m sitting there, thinking, ‘Ooookaaay, someone obviously wasn’t paying attention during history class – a lot of someones, apparently – hmm, they must have been distracted by thinking about how they were off emptying 30 rounds into some innocent animal.’”Carlson also added, “I mean, I know the education in our country isn’t the best in the world, but I figured we’d at least be able to each our kids the basics like math and history. But, I guess I was wrong. What’s the next thing I’m going to hear, that we somehow went to the Moon and that Elvis Presley is dead? Come on, I’m not buying it.”“Like, I can understand about the Second Amendment and maybe something else that happened way, way back, but the King being dead? I really don’t know who would believe that. Just last night I saw him on YouTube. You know YouTube? He was performing in Vegas and there were thousands of bearded and longhaired men in the audience, so it must have been a beard convention or something. I swear, sometimes I don’t believe how stupid Americans can be,” she said.","Former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson has renewed her campaign for a ban on AR-15 rifles, citing recent mass shootings and the devastating toll they have taken on communities across the United States. In a series of tweets, Carlson criticized the deadly weapon and called for immediate action to be taken to ensure the safety of the American people.

""The AR-15 has no place in our society,"" Carlson stated in a tweet. ""It is a weapon of war, designed for killing en masse. We must act now to ban this weapon and save lives.""

The AR-15 has been used in several high-profile mass shootings, including the tragedies at Sandy Hook, Pulse nightclub, and Parkland. Despite calls for stricter gun control measures, including bans on assault-style rifles like the AR-15, the powerful gun lobby has successfully blocked many efforts to curb access to these weapons.

Carlson is not alone in her call for action. A growing number of Americans are speaking out on the need for comprehensive gun reform, including a ban on assault-style weapons.

As the nation continues to grapple with the devastating effects of gun violence, it is critical that leaders take bold action to keep our communities safe. The time to act is now, before more lives are lost to senseless acts of violence."

What better way to sell concessions that to give everyone in the stadium the munchies?SIDENOTE: An inside source with the organization said that it appears that the strain of marijuana that will be used in the making of the marijuana brownies will be Durango Bango which is considered to be the very best weed in the Rocky Mountain State.","The Colorado Rockies Baseball team has recently announced their decision to sell marijuana-laced brownies at their concession stands during the upcoming season. With the legalization of marijuana in Colorado, the team sees this move as a profitable business venture that will attract fans and boost sales.

The decision follows the footsteps of other major league teams across the country that have been experimenting with the sale of cannabis-related products to cater to the high demand among fans. In an interview with the team's spokesperson, it was revealed that the brownies will contain a regulated amount of THC and that sales will be limited to adults above 21 years of age.

While the sale of marijuana is legal in Colorado, the move by the baseball team has raised some concerns in the community. Some parents fear the potential effects of the brownies on their children, while others believe that sports should be kept away from the influence of drugs.

The team has addressed these concerns by assuring the public that they will be taking necessary precautions to avoid any unforeseen incidents. Security measures will be increased, and brownie sales will be strictly monitored to ensure compliance with the state's laws and regulations.

The decision by the Colorado Rockies Baseball team to sell marijuana brownies at their concession stands is a clear indication of the changing times in the state. While some may oppose the move, it is evident that the team has taken a calculated approach to tap into the latest trend in the state and benefit from the legalization of marijuana."

Thanks to Medicaid he’s being treated for cancer. During the CNN town hall with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, Kline explained his situation and his struggles. “My question is pretty straightforward,” Kline told Price. “Why do you want to take away my Medicaid expansion?” Price’s dispassionate answer seemed to fall flat on the audience. “I took care of a lot of patients with cancer,” Price explained about his 20 years as an orthopedic surgeon. “We don’t want to take care away from anybody. What we want to make certain, though, is that every single American has access to the kind of coverage and care that they want for themselves.”“But, what if there are people out there who are going to die more quickly because of what you’re doing here, because you’re essentially taking medical care away from people who need it the most?” Kline wouldn’t back down. “Are you saying you actually want people to be okay with that?” Price thought for a second, then replied: “Look, I understand how all of this sounds right now, but you know, there comes a time in everyone’s life when they just have to stop talking B.S. and be practical. As of right now, the fact to the matter is, our national budget is hemorrhaging money because of Obamacare. And believe me – I get how insensitive that sounds, but at the end of the day, we have to stop ignoring the facts here.”He continued, “I understand that this is not something anyone wants to hear, especially people who’ve got worse problems to deal with than the state of the national budget, but this is one of those situations where the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. When President Trump assumed office, he was appalled at the state of the national budget and our finances. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that Barack Obama was to blame, since he’s the one who left the hot potato behind for us to deal with. Now, I’m not going to go into whether or not he did that on purpose, but at the end of the day, all I can say is, we have to fix the problem or else we’re looking at nationwide riots and another economic recession.”“Put simply, we have to plug some holes – of which, by the way, there are plenty – and we kind of have to start with the biggest ones,” the orthopedic surgeon added. “Unfortunately for millions of people across the country, Obamacare seems to be the biggest one by far. Besides, there are more ways than one to look at this picture. I know it’s not pretty, but at the end of the day, even people who are able to fight off cancer – I’m sure you know what I’m talking about, Brian – they can’t lead 100 percent normal lives, ever again. What kind of an existence is that, to have to survive instead of live?”“At the risk of sounding insensitive, we’ve pretty much got two choices here: we either repeal Obamacare, or we take out more loans from countries like China. And nobody wants to be in debt to the Chinese. At the end of the day, it’s better for our national budget if cancer patients pass away more quickly, it’s a lousy way to live anyway, and I’m sorry to say it out loud, but it’s the truth,” Price concluded.","In November 2020, Brian Kline, a working-class man employed in the retail sector, cast his vote for President Donald Trump. Despite his meager earning of $11.66/hour, Kline believed in the policies and ideology espoused by the President, which he felt aligned with his values and aspirations.

Kline's decision was not unique, as many working-class Americans had been drawn to Trump's promises of economic recovery and job creation. For Kline, who had experienced financial struggles in the past, Trump's commitment to revitalizing the economy was a beacon of hope.

As the country recovers from the pandemic-induced economic crisis, Kline remains steadfast in his support for Trump. He contends that the President's policies have facilitated his own economic growth and improved his quality of life.

Despite the opposition to Trump's presidency, Kline's stance underscores the significance of the working-class vote in shaping the political landscape of the United States. As the country moves forward, it will be interesting to observe how Kline and other working-class Americans continue to navigate the political terrain."

""Inside, we both know what's been going on. We know the game and we're gonna play it,"" said Trump.Governance involves taking difficult steps, said the US president, adding that despite Facebook taking action against fake news, a lot of false stories and 'alternative facts' were still being circulated on the site.Other social websites like Twitter and Instagram, though, will be excluded from the executive order.The people working for Facebook are not happy about this selective exclusion.Rick Rowlinson, a source from Facebook, said that even if the ban on Facebook was actually meant to fight against fake news, the President's ""commitment"" should have not just been limited to Facebook. ""You know the rules and so do I. A full commitment's what I'm thinking of,"" Rowlinson said. ""You wouldn't get this from any other guy,"" he added, shaking his head.In California, where Facebook is based, a large section of people have already begun protesting against this move.Courts in the US had earlier blocked Trump's travel ban executive order.Keen on supporting the President, Vice President Mike Pence has also said that he will support the executive order if it is passed by Trump.Reacting to this proposed order, Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that Facebook will continue to run its operations from California even if the site is banned in the US.On Trump's claim to fight fake news, Zuckerberg said that an outright ban was not the correct way to fight false news.Last month, reports were saying that a court in Pakistan was mulling action against Facebook over 'blasphemous content'.Lately, there have been some countries speaking out against social media websites.

Click here to view the full statements.With inputs from FP Special Forces","Newsreporter: Tensions are high in the United States of America as the year 2017 seems to be taking a bitter turn for the nation. According to reliable sources, President Donald Trump is set to issue an executive order to ban the popular social media site, Facebook, in the country.

This development comes amidst mounting concerns about Facebook's negative impact on American society, particularly its perceived role in spreading fake news and hate speech. Facebook has been regularly accused of being used as a platform to bully, harass and divide communities through its algorithm-driven model.

The proposed executive order from President Trump is set to be a major blow to Facebook and its millions of American users, who use the social media site as a primary outlet of communication. The decision to ban the site will have far-reaching consequences, not only for the social media giant but also for businesses and organizations that use Facebook as a platform to promote their products and services.

This move is expected to ignite a divided response from Americans, as many have grown to rely heavily on Facebook as a means of socializing, sharing news and staying connected. However, critics argue that the decision to ban Facebook is a necessary step towards stemming the tide of the growing division, intolerance, and hostility in American society.

As of now, it remains unclear when the executive order banning Facebook will be issued. However, it is apparent that the year 2017 is likely to be a challenging year for the United States, with the nation grappling with issues of division, uncertainty, and conflict. The eyes of the world will be fixed on America, as the country navigates this unchartered terrain and attempts to find a path towards unity and progress."

New York, USA - After a resounding victory in Super Tuesday, Donald Trump has taken a major step towards securing the Republican presidential nomination. With wins in at least 7 states, Trump's campaign has surged ahead of his competitors, putting him one step closer to becoming the next president of the United States.

However, not everyone is pleased with this news. Pop sensation Miley Cyrus took to Instagram to express her disdain for the controversial billionaire, telling her 38.1 million followers, ""Donald Trump is a fucking nightmare!""

The future of the Republican party remains uncertain, as many members continue to distance themselves from Trump's campaign. Nonetheless, the outcome of Super Tuesday puts the billionaire businessman one step closer to realizing his dream of becoming the next President of the United States."

The residents claimed that they felt ""uncomfortable"" and ""unsafe"" when in his presence, despite the fact that he had not broken any laws.

Though the man, whose identity has not been released, retained proper permits and licenses to carry the firearm, his possession of the gun escalated the level of fear among the neighbors. The police officers deemed it necessary to confiscate the weapon, as they believed it to be a potential threat to public safety.

The situation has sparked a nationwide debate on the rights of gun owners and the safety of ordinary citizens. While some people argue for stricter gun control laws, others maintain that everyone has the right to bear arms and that firearms are important for self-defense in a potentially dangerous world.

This case also raises the issue of individual rights versus public safety and highlights the importance of responsible firearm ownership. Despite the fact that the man in Seattle was not breaking any laws, he made others feel uneasy, and police acted accordingly. The balance between individual rights and public safety is a delicate one, and it is important for citizens to weigh the potential repercussions of their actions.

For now, the confiscated firearm will remain under police custody, and the owner will have to undergo a rigorous process to retrieve it. This event serves as a cautionary tale, reminding gun owners to exercise their rights responsibly and take public perception into account when carrying a firearm in public places."

An unknown portion of these voters may have had their minds controlled by a Russian space-beam, agents close to the investigation say.The allegation that 62 million Americans appear to be employed by Russian intelligence services has rocked the Bureau, and it is reported that multiple agents have taken their own lives, given that realizing just how deep this Russian hacking conspiracy runs blew their minds — literally.This shocking new revelation comes after it was confirmed as a fact that Russia did Wikileaks because Donald Trump personally called Vladimir Putin and asked him to. It was also revealed earlier this week that Alex Jones (real name “Alexi Jonesinov”) is a Russian sleeper agent who was ordered by the FSB (formerly the KGB) to post news articles on the internet saying that Donald Trump would be a good President.However, the revelation that 62 million Americans are taking orders directly from the Kremlin is a revelation of a whole other order, which FBI agents are struggling with how to deal with.It was determined by Puerto Rican federal judge Mizu Tomazaki that it is a crime to support Donald Trump or to post positive things about him on the internet. 9th circuit judges Weinberg, Steinman and Goldenstein upheld the ruling. Despite this, the logistics of rounding up 62 million people and locking them in prison present a difficult task to overcome.It may also be that not every voter is a direct agent of the FSB (formerly the KGB), and some may have been under the control of a mind control beam in space.“We have not determined for sure that everyone who voted for Trump was paid directly by the Kremlin, given that it is highly possible that the Russians used a space-beam from a satellite to control their brains from a facility in St. Petersburg, and moved their bodies like puppets to the polls to check the Trump box,” one current agent familiar with the investigation told the times, describing the process of using a satellite-mounted space-beam to control people’s actions as “Russian neuro-brain hacking.”When asked for comment on these reports by The Times, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the allegations of space-beam mind control by the FSB (formerly the KGB) were “ridiculous,” “outrageous” and “goofy.” However, Peskov suspiciously asked “vere is Moose and Squirrel?”NSA chief Mike Rogers said that though it is a well-established fact that going all the way back to Soviet times, the Russians have used space-beams to control people’s brains, he’s “never seen anything on this scale before.”The Times also sought comment from President Trump; however, when asked about these allegations, he began screaming in Russian and jumped in a big truck and drove off down the road.You are all nuts…almost 1/2 of America voted to make Trump the legal president, and you keep teling us we don’t matter. Install Hillary by force or some other act of politics, and you will have a civil war on your hands.

According to anonymous insiders within the bureau who spoke to The Times on condition of anonymity, the evidence has come to light as part of an ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the election. The sources, who have been involved in the probe from its earliest stages, confirmed that the discovery is the culmination of months of tireless work by the FBI team.

Details of the evidence itself remain unclear at this stage, and the FBI has not yet issued an official comment on the story. However, The Times' sources claimed that the information has been independently verified by multiple experts in the field of cyber security and espionage.

The news is sure to send shockwaves through the American political establishment, and will likely raise serious questions about the legitimacy of Donald Trump's presidency. Critics of the President have long suggested that he may have colluded with Russia to win the election, and this latest revelation will only add fuel to those claims.

Meanwhile, supporters of President Trump are likely to vehemently deny the allegations, and will no doubt point to the lack of concrete evidence presented so far. The FBI's evidence, however, is expected to be presented to Congress in the coming days, at which point further details of the shocking discovery may be made public."
politifact15031,1,0,"Four million people dropped off the food stamp rolls in one month, according to the latest numbers on food stamp enrollment from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).The latest USDA data show that the number of participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the government program that administers food stamps, dropped from 45,666,795 in October 2017 to 41,658,868 in November 2017 — a staggering decrease of 4,007,927 over one month.Even though there was a temporary spike in enrollment, mostly concentrated in a few states that caused the national average of food stamp enrollment to spike, nationwide enrollment in the program as a whole is still on a steady decline.Enrollment in the program sharply increased by 3.5 million during the first month of fiscal year (FY) 2018 (October 2017) mostly due to heavy increases in temporary SNAP enrollment in hurricane-affected states such as Florida and Texas.In Florida alone, food stamp participation soared by 2.5 million from September to October due to the state administering Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (D-SNAP) benefits to poor residents affected by Hurricane Irma.The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service approved Florida’s request to administer these special D-SNAP benefits beginning September 10, 2017.A spokesperson for Florida’s Department of Children and Families (DCF) — the program that administers food stamp benefits in Florida — confirmed with Breitbart News that the dramatic increase in SNAP enrollment in the state was due to disaster relief, but that most food stamp recipients were not normal beneficiaries of the food stamp program.“The dramatic increase in SNAP recipients in the fall was related to the state’s administration of the federal disaster SNAP program following the impact of Hurricane Irma. To qualify for the federal disaster food assistance program, individuals must have lived or worked in one of the 48 declared counties on September 5, and NOT be a customer in the regular food assistance program,” said DCF Communications Director Jessica Sims.Sims added that DCF handed out D-SNAP benefits totaling more than $1 billion to 3.1 million people in the months following Hurricane Irma, but the state curtailed its D-SNAP benefit program on December 3.The sharp decline in food stamp enrollment over one month reflects how states like Florida have curtailed their temporary food stamp benefit programs for those affected by natural disasters.But it also highlights an ongoing downward trend in food stamp enrollment that has been going on for several years since state legislatures enacted welfare reform measures designed to get people back into the workforce.The Trump administration announced that it would adopt some of these state welfare reform measures — such as requiring food stamp recipients to work a certain number of hours per week — and implement them at the federal level, causing nationwide food stamp enrollment to plunge even further.Over the past year since President Donald Trump took office, enrollment in SNAP dropped by two million. The latest food stamp numbers show that the downward trend over the past year — and every year after 2013 — is continuing.","In a remarkable turn of events, four million people have dropped off the food stamp rolls in just one month, according to recent data released by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. This means that enrollment in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which administers food stamps, has dropped from 45,666,795 to 41,658,868 in November of 2017, representing a massive decrease of 4,007,927 people in just a single month. 

This is a positive development in the ongoing fight to alleviate poverty in America, as fewer people needing government assistance for basic necessities is a strong indication of economic vitality. While it is too soon to say whether this trend will continue, this dramatic decrease shows that there are many individuals and families out there who are gradually improving their financial situations and no longer relying on government resources. 

This downward trend in food stamp enrollment can be interpreted as a reflection of the overall improved economic climate in America. With more job opportunities and higher wages, many people are able to step off the government aid programs and pursue self-sufficiency. As the country’s economy continues to recover and strengthen, we can expect to see a reduction in the number of people who are reliant on food stamps and other such programs. The data we have right now is certainly an encouraging sign of progress in this regard."

Senator Lindsay, who has long been a vocal supporter of drug reform policies and has continually pushed for the decriminalization of marijuana and other substances, has been left stunned by the discovery of this illicit operation taking place on his property. While Senator Lindsay has yet to release an official statement on the matter, sources close to the senator have indicated that he is fully cooperating with the DEA in their investigation, and is committed to ensuring that all those responsible for this illegal operation are brought to justice.

This catastrophic event could potentially mark the beginning of an apocalyptic era on our planet.

Although many experts have been debunking these conspiracy theories, there are still many who believe in them. They argue that this collision was predicted by ancient civilizations such as the Mayans, who believed that the end of the world would occur in the year 2012.

Despite the lack of scientific evidence backing up this latest doomsday prediction, it has still managed to cause widespread panic and alarm. Many people have begun stockpiling food, water, and other essential supplies in preparation for the perceived crisis.

The fact of the matter is that there is no credible evidence to support these doomsday predictions. With technological advancements, astronomers have been able to provide clear evidence that there is no threat of an imminent collision between Jupiter and Venus.

Therefore, it is important for the public to remain calm and not be swayed by baseless and unfounded claims. It is essential that we rely on credible sources of information and scientific evidence when it comes to life-altering events such as this.

There is only so much space to put things on the floor, and once bare necessities such as beds, kitchen elements etc. are taken care of, there is little space left to put all of our stuff. Verticality is key in these situations. Wall-mounted shelving is excellent for organizing your stuff and it doesn’t demand a single inch of your floor. They are also quite inexpensive and easy to install. Instead of having an entertainment center, it is now easy to mount your TV and speakers on the wall, leaving more space for things you can’t compromise with.Multi-functional FurnitureIn a tiny house, a bed doesn’t have the luxury to be just a bed. It needs to perform multiple functions, where storage is one of the most important ones. The same applies to coffee and night tables, sofas and kitchen elements. Beds can have drawers for your linens, or room for storage under their mattress. Instead of a regular coffee table, opt in for a cube design, where multiple storage drawers are integrated for all those small things you don’t have space for.Customized FurnitureSometimes it is difficult to furnish a tiny home, especially if it doesn’t use a standard floor plan. Customized furniture is a huge advantage in tiny homes, where space is at a premium. You can make sure that every single corner and nook of your house can be used in a functional way. The same applies to storage. A well-placed shelf or locker, can perform a very important function while not taking up much space or by utilizing and otherwise unused space. Customized furniture does come at a premium price, but it is one of those investments you will not lose any sleep over once you are living in your tiny home.Tiny AppliancesEvery piece of furniture and appliance you put into your tiny home, will make you compromise on something else. Tiny living is about downsizing your living space to bare necessities but that has a different meaning for different people. In order to create more space for storing stuff you can’t live without, making some sacrifices when it comes to appliances is important. Instead of a full-sized stove, opt in for a dual heat-plate design that will take up less space. A small refrigerator works fine, just like a large two-door model. Also shopping more frequently for fresh groceries will lead you to a healthier lifestyle and diet. A fold out dinning-table in the kitchen, saves you the space that you might need for a dining table. Tiny appliances and gadgets do tend to have a higher price than standard ones, but they provide so much more than function to tiny home dwellers.","In a recent study, it has been found that living in regular-sized homes with plenty of space for closets, lockers, and shelves may be hindering our ability to think about storage space. The study, conducted by a group of esteemed researchers in the field of psychology, has discovered a direct correlation between the amount of storage space available to an individual and the amount of time they spend thinking about organizing and storing their belongings.

According to the study, individuals who reside in homes with ample storage space are less likely to think about the storage of their belongings, and therefore less likely to take the time to properly organize and store them. Researchers suggest that this lack of consideration can lead to a range of negative consequences, from clutter and disorganization to lost or damaged items.

""The amount of storage space we have available to us plays a crucial role in our ability to effectively manage and organize our belongings,"" explained lead researcher Dr. Samantha Lee. ""Living in a home with little need for storage can lead to complacency, which in turn leads to a lack of organization and a greater chance of lost or damaged items.""

The study's findings have widespread implications, particularly for individuals who reside in homes with abundant storage space. Researchers suggest that these individuals should take steps to actively consider their storage needs and strive to maintain a high level of organization in order to avoid negative consequences.

Overall, this study sheds new light on the relationship between storage space and organization, and underscores the importance of maintaining a healthy balance between the two in order to live a well-organized and efficient life."

In an emergency meeting on Thursday, the city council held an emergency meeting to initiate impeachment proceedings which begin on Monday.Donald Trump has helped Puerto Rico and other hurricane-affected areas much more efficiently than any previous President, and Puerto Rico needs to replace their leadership with someone who understands and appreciates that before they lose the aid we aren’t even required to give them.","In a stunning turn of events, the leaders of the city of San Juan have decided to withhold aid from the rest of the country in response to Donald Trump's hint of ending aid to Puerto Rico. This decision comes after a long and desperate struggle for support from the mainland, which has left the people of Puerto Rico in dire straits.

The mayor of San Juan, Carmen Yulin Cruz, has been at the forefront of calls for aid to the island, which has been devastated by hurricanes and earthquakes. Yet faced with the prospect of losing support from the mainland, other leaders in the city have finally taken action.

It is a move that is sure to have repercussions both on the island and across the country. The people of Puerto Rico have already suffered greatly and the loss of vital aid could prove catastrophic. At the same time, the decision by San Juan's leaders to withhold aid could damage relations between the city and the rest of the country.

Whatever the consequences of this decision, it is clear that the situation in Puerto Rico remains dire. We urge all our readers to share this story with their friends and help raise awareness of the need for urgent aid to the island. The people of Puerto Rico deserve nothing less than our full support in this time of crisis."
politifact14128,1,0,"Workers in New Orleans dismantled the city’s Jefferson Davis monument early Thursday, removing the prominent statue of the Confederate leader that had stood for more than 100 years.As workers slung a strap around the statue’s waist and lifted it off its pedestal, at least 100 people cheered from across the street, outnumbering the few dozen protesters of the removal, some waving Confederate flags.“This historic moment is an opportunity to join together as one city and redefine our future,” Mayor Mitch Landrieu said as he announced that crews had begun removing the statue, the second of four planned removals of Confederacy-related monuments.The Mayor also made an announcement that the statue would be replaced with a bronze statue of the 44th President Barack Obama.“It will be nice”, Landrieu said, “to see a monument to our first African-American President in the same spot that used to be a place to memorialize old racist White privilege.”The Obama statue will be patterned after one erected in Kenya last year and will reportedly cost the Louisana taxpayers an estimated $800,000 dollars.Like an earlier removal, this one was performed in the dark because of death threats against city officials and contractors.Beaureguard Billy-Bob Johnson, one of the leaders of the opposition was outraged by not only the statue being taken down but the fact that it occurred in the middle of the night.“We would have preferred it to be in the daytime,” Johnson said, “so everybody could see what they are doing the light of day. And I really hate coming downtown at night with all the darkies afoot and everything.”Before the monument could be removed, police had to clear the immediate area of demonstrators — both supporters of the monuments and those who want them taken away. Barricades were used to keep the sides separated, NOLA.com reported. The news outlet said chants by monument supporters included “Where’s Mitch?” while opponents chanted, “Hey hey, ho ho, white supremacy has got to go.”As Fox news reported earlier, the mayor’s plan calls for the Davis statue to be melted down and cast into smaller statues of Black Lives Matter leaders.","New Orleans, Louisiana - In a controversial move that has been debated for years, workers in New Orleans dismantled the city's Jefferson Davis monument early Thursday morning. The prominent statue of the Confederate leader had loomed over the city for over 100 years, but times have changed and attitudes have shifted.

This move comes after many attempts by activists and city officials to remove the monument, citing its ties to a dark period in American history when slavery was openly practiced in this country. The monument had become a source of division in the city, with many arguing it was a reminder of a time when black Americans were viewed as less than human.

Mayor Mitch Landrieu, who has been a vocal supporter of the monument's removal, said in a statement that the action was necessary to help the city move forward.

""This monument has stood for more than a century, but our city has changed,"" Landrieu said. ""We must acknowledge our history, but we must also create a future that is inclusive and embraces diversity. The removal of this monument is an important step in that journey.""

The removal of the monument didn't come without controversy, however. Many in the community, including some who identified as white supremacists, saw the move as an attack on their heritage and a further erosion of traditional American values.

Despite these objections, the workers continued with their work, dismantling the monument piece by piece until it was completely removed. The city has not yet announced a plan for what will replace the statue, but many activists are calling for a monument that celebrates the contributions of African Americans to this country.

The removal of the Jefferson Davis monument is just one step in a longer journey for New Orleans and for America. But as the statue is taken down, it is clear that this city is committed to moving forward towards a more just and equitable future."
politifact15280,1,0,"A leaked Hillary Clinton email confirms that the Obama administration, with Hillary at the helm, orchestrated a civil war in Syria to benefit Israel.The new Wikileaks release shows the then Secretary of State ordering a war in Syria in order to overthrow the government and oust President Assad, claiming it was the “best way to help Israel”.Newobserveronline.com reports:The document was one of many unclassified by the US Department of State under case number F-2014-20439, Doc No. C05794498, following the uproar over Clinton’s private email server kept at her house while she served as Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013.Although the Wikileaks transcript dates the email as December 31, 2000, this is an error on their part, as the contents of the email (in particular the reference to May 2012 talks between Iran and the west over its nuclear program in Istanbul) show that the email was in fact sent on December 31, 2012.The email makes it clear that it has been US policy from the very beginning to violently overthrow the Syrian government—and specifically to do this because it is in Israel’s interests.“The best way to help Israel deal with Iran’s growing nuclear capability is to help the people of Syria overthrow the regime of Bashar Assad,” Clinton forthrightly starts off by saying.Even though all US intelligence reports had long dismissed Iran’s “atom bomb” program as a hoax (a conclusion supported by the International Atomic Energy Agency), Clinton continues to use these lies to “justify” destroying Syria in the name of Israel.She specifically links Iran’s mythical atom bomb program to Syria because, she says, Iran’s “atom bomb” program threatens Israel’s “monopoly” on nuclear weapons in the Middle East.If Iran were to acquire a nuclear weapon, Clinton asserts, this would allow Syria (and other “adversaries of Israel” such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt) to “go nuclear as well,” all of which would threaten Israel’s interests.Therefore, Clinton, says, Syria has to be destroyed.Iran’s nuclear program and Syria’s civil war may seem unconnected, but they are. What Israeli military leaders really worry about — but cannot talk about — is losing their nuclear monopoly.An Iranian nuclear weapons capability would not only end that nuclear monopoly but could also prompt other adversaries, like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, to go nuclear as well. The result would be a precarious nuclear balance in which Israel could not respond to provocations with conventional military strikes on Syria and Lebanon, as it can today.If Iran were to reach the threshold of a nuclear weapons state, Tehran would find it much easier to call on its allies in Syria and Hezbollah to strike Israel, knowing that its nuclear weapons would serve as a deterrent to Israel responding against Iran itself.It is, Clinton continues, the “strategic relationship between Iran and the regime of Bashar Assad in Syria” that makes it possible for Iran to undermine Israel’s security.This would not come about through a “direct attack,” Clinton admits, because “in the thirty years of hostility between Iran and Israel” this has never occurred, but through its alleged “proxies.”The end of the Assad regime would end this dangerous alliance. Israel’s leadership understands well why defeating Assad is now in its interests.Bringing down Assad would not only be a massive boon to Israel’s security, it would also ease Israel’s understandable fear of losing its nuclear monopoly.Then, Israel and the United States might be able to develop a common view of when the Iranian program is so dangerous that military action could be warranted.Clinton goes on to asset that directly threatening Bashar Assad “and his family” with violence is the “right thing” to do:In short, the White House can ease the tension that has developed with Israel over Iran by doing the right thing in Syria.With his life and his family at risk, only the threat or use of force will change the Syrian dictator Bashar Assad’s mind.The email prov","In a shocking revelation, a leaked email from former US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, has confirmed long-held suspicions of the Obama administration's involvement in orchestrating the Syrian civil war - all to benefit Israel.

The email, believed to be sent in 2012, sheds light on the extent to which the US government was willing to go to serve Israeli interests in the Middle East. Clinton, who was at the helm of the State Department at the time, appears to have been instrumental in planning and executing the disastrous war that has left Syria in ruins and countless lives lost.

The email reveals that the Obama administration's goal was to destabilize the Syrian government, which was seen as a threat to Israel's security. The plan was to create a civil war that would ultimately weaken the Syrian regime and allow Israel to expand its influence in the region. The email also suggests that the US was willing to arm and train extremist groups, including Al-Qaeda affiliates, in order to achieve this goal.

The consequences of the Syrian civil war have been catastrophic for both Syria and the wider region. The conflict has displaced millions of people, caused untold suffering, and left the country in ruins. The revelation that the US government may have actively contributed to such devastation in pursuit of its own interests is deeply concerning and raises serious questions about American foreign policy.

In light of this new information, calls are growing for a full investigation into the Obama administration's role in the Syrian conflict. The people of Syria deserve answers about the devastating war that has shattered their lives. The world needs to know the truth about the lengths to which the US government was willing to go in service of its own agenda."

This prompted Trump to send a massive warning to Obama and his deep state minions that they won’t soon forget!Mad World News reported that Obama just jetted off to New Zealand this week, and he immediately imposed a strict ban on the media covering the events he plans to hold there. It should come as no surprise that Obama chose to leave the country right now, however, as the heat was just turned up on his deep state after the firing of now former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.In the wake of this firing, it was confirmed that Obama left behind a trail of damning evidence inside the Oval Office. The evidence proves that it was actually the Obama administration that colluded with Russia to thwart then-candidate Donald Trump during the presidential election, and they didn’t cover their tracks well enough.The members of Obama’s deep state that took part in this plan included ormer FBI Director James Comey, former National Security Advisor Susan Rice, former UN Ambassador Samantha Powers, and Lisa Monaco, who was the head of the DOJ National Security Division. Monaco slipped up and left an evidence trail going from the illegal unmasking of US citizens being done, Trump and his campaign people, under the illegal FISA warrants, back to the Oval Office via the “Presidential Daily Briefings” (PDB).“During the 2015/2016 presidential election, Lisa Monaco was one of the key WH figures doing the unmasking of raw intelligence provided by the ‘small group’ collaborators (with Susan Rice, Ben Rhodes). Monaco was also one of the key policy strategists, heck, she was the architect, who utilized the compartmentalization of intelligence to hide the fingerprints of collaboration. This was the issue that initially stymied HSPCI Devin Nunes,” reported The Conservative Treehouse.Nunes eventually found Obama’s PDBs which have all the illegal FISA activity and other illegal spy games targeting Trump.“Nunes stated the intelligence product he reviewed was ‘not related to Russia, or the FBI Russian counter-intelligence investigation.’ So the product itself was likely a product for the President, that was not part of the ongoing FBI counter-intel product,” reported The Conservative Treehouse.These PDBs prove Obama was in on this from the very beginning, and he hasn’t stopped trying to take Trump down since then. Last month, Obama and his deep state set up a website called “National Security Action,” who says their mission is, “Under President Trump’s reckless leadership, the United States is weaker in the world, less safe, and more isolated. He is retreating from the world stage, undercutting the intelligence and law enforcement agencies that keep us safe, undermining the diplomacy that prevents wars, insulting our allies, attacking democratic traditions, and cozying up to dictators while abandoning America’s commitment to universal rights and human dignity.”These people are just trying to get Trump impeached so they can swoop in and take back the White House as soon as he is out of it.

The warrant comes in response to allegations made by current President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly claimed that the Obama Administration engaged in illegal surveillance of his campaign team. 

The decision to issue the warrant was made after a careful review of the evidence presented by the Trump Administration, which includes numerous reports from individuals who claim to have witnessed wiretapping taking place, as well as audio recordings purporting to be of Obama and his top advisors discussing the surveillance effort. 

The charges against Obama include violations of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), as well as conspiracy to commit wire fraud and electronic surveillance. If convicted, he could face up to 10 years in federal prison.

She has pushed the lie about President Trump having Russian connections and has even had to admit that no facts exists to condemn the White House for.Now the demented Democrat is looking even more foolish since an observant Reddit user known as 1tch has taken the time to gather the facts together showing that “Over Her 35 Years In Congress Maxine Waters Has Missed 90% Of Congressional Meetings.”Known in some circles as “the Poverty Pimp,” Waters has been peddling race baiting, socialist agenda’s, and a hatred for President that borders is obsessive, she has accomplished very little in her career.Even today, she finds herself above impeachment and was so terribly rude to one of her own constituents that watching the video of it is cringe worthy, to say the least.On top of that, she seems to imply that as a woman of color, she can not be thrown out of office.While the word “color” may have been been “Congress” since she mumbles more than speaks, it is clear that race over substance matters is the Waters credo.Then again, when one attends only 10% of the meetings that are expected of them, there is not much other than skin color for her to drivel on about. She has not real record to run on, only that she is a minority.Thankfully, even other minorities are running against her and some of them have gathered outside her million dollar estate to show her their displeasure with her service.Still, America was well aware that Waters is nothing but a loud but unproductive member of the swamp, we just never knew how little time she spent there.Come to think of it, considering her views, it may, in fact, be better if she spent even less time there!Sources: Teddy Stick – 1tch","Democratic Representative Maxine Waters from California has been called out for her behavior as a public servant. According to an anonymous source, Waters is known for her unpleasant personality and is constantly filled with anger, which she seems to flaunt as a badge of honor.

As an elected official, Waters has a responsibility to act with decorum, dignity, and respect towards her constituents and colleagues. However, her behavior makes it difficult for her to fulfill her duties effectively. Her constant fury and unpleasant demeanor create an unfavorable work environment and may inhibit her ability to effectively communicate with others.

It is alarming to see such behavior from an appointed representative of the people. It is essential that elected officials keep their emotions in check and be able to engage in respectful dialogue on issues affecting the people they represent. Conducting oneself in a manner that is anything less than that is unacceptable and calls into question one's commitment to serving the public.

Waters must recognize the severity of her actions and the impact they have on those around her. She must strive to conduct herself in a more professional manner and work towards creating a positive work environment that fosters collaboration and progress for all. The public deserves nothing less from their elected officials, and it is their right to demand better conduct from those who serve them."

Several former friends and classmates have come forward, describing him as a ""creepy"" and ""outcast"" individual who never quite fit in. They also revealed that Kelley was an atheist who frequently took to social media to berate and antagonize religious believers.

These revelations have fuelled speculation that Kelley's disdain towards religion may have played a pivotal role in his heinous crime. His erratic and violent behavior, coupled with his vocal animosity towards those who held religious beliefs, raises serious concerns about the growing division and hostility towards religion in society.

While the nation mourns and grapples with yet another senseless act of violence, it is important that we do not overlook the larger issues at play. The rise of atheism and hostility towards religion must be addressed and confronted head-on, lest we end up with more tragedies like the one that befell the First Baptist Church."

Foster’s death in 1993 had been ruled a suicide..With new evidence, Rep. Trey Gowdy successfully petitioned a federal judge to have the body of Vince Foster exhumed for autopsy. The body wasn’t autopsied before burial the first time, which aided in the theory of a cover-up. Forensic specialists examined the body last night at the Naval Hospital in Norfolk, Virginia, concluding that the cause of death for Mr. Foster should be changed from suicide to homicide..LT Col. James McFitting, head of the hospital’s forensics lab, told reporters in his office that Foster had not one but two gunshot wounds, both of which would have been fatal. There would be no way he could have pulled the trigger himself a second time. The wounds were also in the back of his head, meaning unless he reached all the way around to make it look like a murder and fired two identical guns at the same time, the original story was impossible..The doctor who signed Foster’s death certificate died in a car crash a few months later and the police detectives who worked the case have both left the country, never to be seen again. Without the letter from the reporter, Mr. Foster may have never seen justice..The case has been turned over to the FBI, who has clear jurisdiction at this point, for the difficult task of connecting the dots from Foster’s death directly to Bill and Hillary Clinton.

Those are costs you bore to support your job or an investment you own or to pay a professional to prepare your income tax return.This year cops and other first responders can write off the costs of buying uniforms and dry cleaning them. But in 2018, cops who buy their uniforms or are required to buy their own guns and ammunition will no longer be able to deduct those costs as reasonable and necessary expenses to support their earning a paycheck, thanks to Trump and Congressional Republicans.But that’s not all. Cops and anyone else who belongs to a union will no longer be allowed to deduct their union dues. People who must bear travel costs without reimbursement from their employers will just have to suck it up starting in January.Add police officers, the military, teachers, nurses and first responders to the long, long list of hard working Americans that Donald Trump and the Republican party want to make suffer. And all to give the wealthiest among us more wealth.Shameful.","The recently passed tax bill has been widely denounced as the single worst piece of legislation in the history of American politics. Experts across the political spectrum agree that this bill will have devastating consequences for the American people, particularly for the middle class and the poor.

According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, the tax bill will add $1.5 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. This will result in cuts to vital programs like Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security, which millions of Americans depend on for their healthcare and retirement.

Additionally, the bill disproportionately benefits the wealthiest Americans and corporations, who will receive massive tax cuts while many working families will actually see their taxes increase over time. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that nearly 90% of the benefits of the tax bill will go to the top 1% of earners.

Furthermore, the bill contains numerous provisions that will harm the environment, including opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling, weakening protections for public lands and waters, and repealing tax credits for wind and solar energy.

In short, the recently passed tax bill represents a betrayal of the American people and a grave threat to our nation's future. It is imperative that we hold our elected officials accountable and demand a tax policy that puts the needs of all Americans first."
politifact14021,1,0,"COSTA MESA, Ca. – GOP presidential front-runner and billionaire entrepreneur Donald Trump on Thursday unveiled his plan to ‘make the military great again,’ saying he intends to reinstate the draft as part of a larger effort to bolster America’s armed forces. “We’re bringing back the draft, okay? We’re going to bring it back and were going to make America as strong as we were in the Sixties,” Trump declared while addressing supporters at the Pacific Amphitheater in Costa Mesa.“I love the Sixties,” said Trump, continuing, “I was a very big supporter of the Vietnam war and, of course, the troops. No one supports the troops more than I do.” In addition to bringing back military conscription, Mr. Trump said that if elected, he will enact legislation that will guarantee citizenship to anyone who serves in the armed forces for a minimum of four years. “You have people coming into this country, coming over our borders, expecting a free ride. We’re not going to give it to them, folks. They’re going to have to earn their citizenship.”Trump has repeatedly stated that he won’t rule out using nuclear weapons against the Islamic State. On Thursday he expanded on his claims, saying he would instruct the Pentagon to begin testing “man-portable” tactical nuclear weapons to be used by American soldiers on the battlefield. “We’re not going to have unquestionable military dominance if we’re seen as too weak to use these weapons against our enemies.”Rather than use conventional means such as drone strikes or economic sanctions to respond to acts of terrorism or other forms of aggression against the United States, Trump vowed to exercise the nuclear option “extremely” liberally. “My feeling is we have these weapons and we’ve spent a great deal of money developing and improving them over the years; there’s absolutely no reason why we shouldn’t be using them.”The former reality TV star accused President Obama of making the country less safe by employing tact and diplomacy when dealing with foreign leaders. “This guy’s the president of the United States and he’s bowing to the Chinese. They’re laughing in our faces, okay? They’re laughing in our faces and if we don’t do something about it, they’re going to surpass us militarily and economically and then we’re going to have a huge problem on our hands.”Donald Trump kicked off the start of his California campaign on Thursday where he made a stop in Costa Mesa, a semi-rural farming community located in Orange County.

During a speech given on Thursday evening, the billionaire and construction mogul said that he intends to strengthen America's defense by reinstating compulsory military service, popularly known as the draft. The move comes as part of a larger effort to revamp the country's military, which he said had been left weakened by years of underfunding and neglect.

Speaking to a crowd in California, the presidential candidate expressed his intentions to reintroduce the draft under his administration, stating that the current US military is stretched too thin, and the young men and women of America are neglected for employment opportunities and their contribution to the nation's safety and security.

Trump's proposal to reinstate the draft model is said to include all men and women in their twenties, with no exemptions. Furthermore, the candidate highlighted his willingness to work with Congress to increase military expenditure, staffing, recruitment, and technological advancement to better equip US forces against potential adversaries.

Concerns, however, have been raised due to the proposal's potential implications for hundreds and thousands of young Americans. At present, the US military operates by staff volunteering, and there are more than 1.2 million active-duty service members.

Trump's plan to bring back the draft is expected to ignite a national conversation about the military's mission, the army's budgeting, as well as the importance of America's role as a global superpower. With the presidential elections only a few months away, the Republican's vision for the future of America's military will remain a topic of debate among the Democratic peers for some time to come."

politifact15334,1,0,"‘Smallville’ star Allison Mack has confessed that she sold children to the Rothschilds and Clintons during her time in the child sex cult.According to police, Allison Mack worked in a senior management position for the Hollywood pedophile cult NXIVM. As second-in-command, it was her job to lure children into the cult in order to sell them to elite Hollywood pedophiles and powerful politicians.Thefreethoughtproject.com reports: “As alleged in the indictment, Allison Mack recruited women to join what was purported to be a female mentorship group that was, in fact, created and led by Keith Raniere. The victims were then exploited, both sexually and for their labor, to the defendants’ benefit,” U.S. Attorney Richard P. Donoghue said in a statement.The cult was finally exposed when the daughter of former Dynasty actress Catherine Oxenberg became a member. Oxenberg told the New York Times that she became concerned after she saw that her 26-year-old daughter India was extremely emaciated from dieting, and was suffering from serious health problems.“Some people have said this is a voluntary sorority. The women I have spoken to tell a far different story,” Oxenberg said. “Coercion is not voluntary. Extortion is not voluntary. Blackmail is not voluntary.”When these accusations hit the news, other women, including actress Sarah Edmondson, came forward to all to tell the same story, of the blackmail, the branding, as well as the forced labor and forced sexual activity.Raniere is also accused of having a history of pedophilia, with accusations that stretch back over 20 years, involving girls as young as 12.In 2012, several women were interviewed by the Albany Times Union about the coercive sexual experiences that they had with Raniere when they were young girls. One of the women in the case was found dead of a gunshot wound before she was able to give the interview. Her death was ruled a suicide.The U.S. attorney’s office requested to have Raniere held without bail in a letter to the court stating that he was a known child predator.Although this extremely important detail is being left out of most mainstream reports, one of the main charges in the criminal indictment against Raniere and Mack is sex trafficking of children.A quick search for Allison Mack’s arrest report or charges—as reported by the mainstream media—will not yield any mention of children. Most mainstream reports only mention sex trafficking and ominously omit that the charges were for sex trafficking of children. Exactly why the media is refusing to report this remains a mystery.Another important aspect of this case that has been largely overlooked, is the connections that this organization has to high-level figures in politics and finance. The organization worked much like a pyramid scheme, collecting regular fees from its members. But the majority of the funding, over $150 million, came from the trust funds of Seagram heiresses, Sara and Clare Bronfman.Their involvement with Raniere began in 2002 and has been very public and controversial, with other members of the Bronfman family distancing themselves from the sisters in the press. The Bronfman family has very close ties to the Rothschild banking dynasty, with members of both families belonging to many of the same companies, including their joint financial firm, Bronfman & Rothschild.Additionally, at least three high-ranking members of the organization, including Nancy Salzman and the Bronfman sisters, are members of Bill Clinton’s foundation, the Clinton Global Initiative, which requires an annual $15,000 membership fee.Now that Raniere is in jail and Mack is on bail and ordered not to have any contact with other cult members, Clare Bronfman has taken on the role of leader within the organization.In response to the recent controversy surrounding NXIVM, Bronfman made a statement on her website denying the accusations against Raniere. She praised Raniere and the NXIVM programs, insisting that she is doing work that is tru","In a shocking turn of events, 'Smallville' star Allison Mack has admitted to selling children to high-profile individuals as part of her involvement in a child sex cult. Mack revealed during her trial that she sold minors to some of the most affluent and powerful families in the world, including the Rothschilds and Clintons.

The startling revelation has sent shockwaves throughout the country, tarnishing the reputations of those involved and sparking outrage among the public. Mack's involvement in the cult first came to light in 2018, when she was arrested for her role in the group and charged with sex trafficking and conspiracy to commit forced labor.

Since then, the former actress has faced intense scrutiny from both the media and law enforcement officials. However, her recent confession has shed new light on the horrific extent of the cult's activities and the damage it has caused to countless innocent lives.

politifact15625,1,0,"San Juan mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz’s party are facing fraud charges relating to the embezzlement of over $3 million in federal funds, just months after she appeared on CNN and blamed President Trump for mishandling the Puerto Rico hurricane disaster response.Despite the fact that the U.S. government sent emergency workers, supplies and billions of dollars to the territory, its Democrat-allied politicians still pointed a finger at the president — and the left-leaning mainstream media happily spread the “blame Trump” narrative.As comparisons to George W. Bush and Hurricane Katrina grew, figures like San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz attacked Trump for supposedly mishandling the disaster response, despite the fact that emergency management experts praised the president and FEMA’s actions.“What is really nasty is that anyone would turn their back on the Puerto Rican people,” Yulín Cruz declared at the time, even wearing a T-shirt labeled “NASTY” — where did she get it during a major storm? — as part of a petty jab at the U.S. president.Liberals across the United States, glued to CNN, cheered the San Juan mayor and declared her a national hero. “We are dying, and you (Trump) are killing us with the inefficiency and the bureaucracy,” she said during a television conference in early October.Western Journal reports: Fast forward to this week. It turns out that sure enough, there was plenty of “inefficiency and bureaucracy” in Puerto Rico … but it looks like the island’s own liberal politicians were likely the ones behind it.According to the Associated Press, a Puerto Rican mayor and two additional island officials have now been charged with corruption.Although the alleged crimes go back before Hurricane Maria made landfall in the Caribbean, the arrests paint a dire picture of widespread corruption and misuse of government funds during the same general time frame as the disaster.“The suspects are the mayor of the southwest town of Sabana Grande and the former directors of finance for the northern town of Toa Baja,” the AP reported.“U.S. Attorney Rosa Emilia Rodriguez told reporters that the former officials from Toa Baja are accused of using nearly $5 million worth of federal funds to pay the town’s public employees and municipal contractors,” the newswire continued.“Not only is that illegal, it’s immoral,” Rodriguez added.Puerto Rico officials are accused of taking millions of dollars that was granted by the United States for assistance programs and re-directing it wherever they saw fit, such as taking $2.5 million from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and using it to pay town employees.At the center of the illegal scheme is Miguel Ortiz Vélez, who served as mayor. Ortiz Vélez belongs to the Popular Democratic Party, which is affiliated with the more well-known Democrat party in the mainland United States.Guess who else belongs to the same liberal PDP political group: Carmen Yulín Cruz, the person who was blaming Trump for hurricane deaths while her own party was defrauding taxpayers and laundering aid money. Is anyone surprised?There may be more arrests to follow, as well. Government officials said that more corruption is suspected, and additional Puerto Rican officials are under scrutiny.“Rodriguez said the investigation into alleged corruption in Toa Baja is ongoing because officials believe other people are involved,” the AP confirmed.The hurricane that devastated Puerto Rico was certainly a tragedy, and many lessons about disaster preparedness can be learned from that incident.However, it’s abundantly clear that widespread corruption and incompetence in Puerto Rico was a major part of the chaos. That corruption doesn’t point to Donald Trump … it leads right to the same leftist Democrats who were trying to point fingers the entire time.","San Juan mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz and her party, the Popular Democratic Party (PPD), are currently grappling with a grave legal issue as they face fraud charges amounting to more than $3 million. The charges are related to the embezzlement of federal funds, and they come only a few months after the mayor had publicly criticized President Trump for his alleged mishandling of the Puerto Rico hurricane disaster response.

According to sources, Carmen Yulín Cruz and other members of the PPD have been charged with fraudulent activities that took place during their tenure as public officials, which resulted in the forceful misappropriation of federal funds. The investigations revealed that the accused used their position of power to divert funds to their personal accounts, colluding with other parties to cover up their fraudulent activities.

This has come as a shock to the people of San Juan, as the PPD has been one of the most prominent political parties in the city, with a reputation for integrity, honesty, and transparency. However, the recent events have tarnished the reputation of the party and its leaders, creating an atmosphere of distrust and outrage towards the accused.

In light of these allegations, Carmen Yulín Cruz has stepped down from her position as the mayor of San Juan. In a statement issued to the press, she declared her innocence and expressed her willingness to cooperate with the investigations. She also apologized to the citizens of San Juan for the larceny and fraud perpetrated by her associates.

The case has now been handed over to the court, and the accused will have to face the consequences of their actions. The people of San Juan and Puerto Rico as a whole are looking for answers, and they demand justice for the embezzlement of the federal funds. It remains to be seen how this case will be resolved and what impact it will have on the future of Puerto Rican politics."

Critics of the Queen's statement argue that it goes against the principles of equality and diversity, which Britain prides itself on.

As the debate over immigration and refugee policies rages on, Britain stands at a crossroads. While it is understandable that people are concerned about the potential threat of terrorism, it is equally important to uphold the values of inclusivity, compassion and respect that Britain prides itself on. It remains to be seen how Britain will tread this delicate balance, but one thing is clear, the Queen's comments have stirred the pot and ignited a conversation that needs to be had."

The pontiff's appeal was made during a special address to a group of world leaders gathered at the Vatican.

In a powerful and emotional speech, Pope Francis underscored the urgent need to eradicate gun violence from every corner of the planet. He spoke passionately about the devastating impact that guns have had on communities and individuals around the world, and emphasized the moral imperative to take decisive action now.

""We have seen far too many lives lost, far too many families shattered, and far too much suffering inflicted by the scourge of gun violence,"" the Pope said. ""We cannot allow this terrible epidemic to continue unchecked. We must act with courage and conviction, and we must act now.""

Pope Francis went on to detail a comprehensive set of measures that he believes can help to stem the tide of gun violence. These include stricter regulations on gun ownership and sales, increased resources for mental health services, and improved education and awareness programs aimed at preventing gun accidents and suicides.

However, the Pope's most controversial proposal was his call for a global gun confiscation program, with the exception of the United Nations. This move has sparked heated debate among pro-gun advocates, many of whom see it as an infringement on their constitutional rights.

Despite the controversy, many world leaders have applauded the Pope's bold stance, expressing their support for a world free from the horrors of gun violence. The Pope's plea serves as a powerful reminder that we must all work together to create a safer and more peaceful world for ourselves and future generations."

His body was found two hours later after the pressure cooker, which reached a temperature of 270 degrees, was turned off and opened.The company, its plant Operations Director Angel Rodriguez and former safety manager Saul Florez were each charged with three counts of violating Occupational Safety & Health Administration rules that caused a death.The charges specify that the company and the two men willfully violated rules that require implementing a safety plan, rules for workers entering confined spaces, and a procedure to keep machinery or equipment turned off if someone's working on it.Rodriguez, 63, of Riverside, and Florez, 42, of Whittier, could face up to three years in prison and fines up to $250,000 if convicted of all charges, prosecutors said.

The unfortunate worker was cooked to death in an industrial oven together with tons of tuna at the company's processing plant in Santa Fe Springs, California. The incident had occurred on October 15, 2012, as a result of the company's failure to implement necessary safety measures during the processing of their products. 

The charges brought against Bumble Bee Foods include willful violation of safety regulations, causing a work-related death. If found guilty, the company could face up to $1.5 million in fines and the two managers are also facing three years in prison. The investigation into the incident took several years and the charges that have been made sent shockwaves throughout the industry. 

Prosecutors have described the incident as a preventable tragedy, citing the company's negligence in ensuring a safe workplace for its employees. The death of the worker was a sobering reminder of the need for companies to prioritize the safety of their workers, especially those who work in hazardous environments. 

The charges demonstrate the seriousness with which authorities view non-compliance with safety regulations and should act as a wake-up call to companies to ensure that they are adhering to safety guidelines. The outcome of this case will not only determine the fate of the company and its managers but also serve as a warning to all others in the industry that their responsibility to their workers' safety should never be taken for granted."

politifact15146,1,0,"The Democrats mulling a run for the White House in 2020 are facing intense pressure from liberals to campaign on abolishing the agency that enforces federal immigration laws, a proposal that was once relegated to the far-left fringe.In protesting the Trump administration’s policies toward illegal immigration, liberal commentators and writers have been embracing the idea of gutting the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, which identifies, arrests and deports illegal immigrants inside the United States.“This is a growing position on the left, and I imagine 2020 Democratic presidential aspirants will have to grapple with it,” liberal writer and MSNBC host Chris Hayes tweeted.In January, the idea was endorsed by Brian Fallon, a former top aide to 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and Eric Holder, President Barack Obama’s attorney general. The Daily Caller first drew attention to the calls.“ICE operates as an unaccountable deportation force,” Fallon tweeted. “Dems running in 2020 should campaign on ending the agency in its current form.”Thomas Homan, the acting director of ICE, has reacted to these calls by Democrats by saying they should speak to victims of illegal immigrant crime.“These politicians, they need to talk to the victims of alien crime, talk to the parents that I talk to that lost children at the hands of criminal aliens,” Homan said Thursday on Fox News’ “Tucker Carlson Tonight.”But the idea has picked up steam in recent days after Hayes, the MSNBC host, asked Democratic California Sen. Kamala Harris if she believes ICE should exist.“ICE has a purpose, ICE has a role, ICE should exist,” Harris, a potential 2020 candidate, responded. “But let’s not abuse the power.”Since then, Harris, the former attorney general of California, has faced a backlash from liberal publications.“Kamala Harris is very likely running for president in 2020,” Jack Mirkinson of the liberal Splinter website wrote. “It should be a political problem for her that she is not willing to take her criticisms of ICE to their logical conclusion and call for its abolition.”He added: “She should be asked, over and over again, why exactly she is willing to uphold the legitimacy of such a racist, corrupt, and thuggish organization.”Mirkinson wrote that other potential candidates -- like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti -- “should be asked the same question.”PELOSI SLAMS CALIFORNIA ICE RAID AS ‘UNJUST AND CRUEL’The Nation, a liberal magazine, last week also published an article titled “It’s Time to Abolish ICE.” The writer accused the agency of being part of an “unbridled white-supremacist surveillance state” and called it “an unaccountable strike force executing a campaign of ethnic cleansing.”“Though the party has moved left on core issues -- from reproductive rights to single-payer health care -- it’s time for progressives to put forward a demand that deportation be taken not as the norm, but rather as a disturbing indicator of authoritarianism,” McElwee wrote.Democratic officeholders also have been openly rebelling against ICE, including Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, who recently tipped off the public to an immigration raid in the San Francisco Bay Area.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., last week slammed that raid as ""unjust and cruel.""Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in a speech in California last week, said as many as 800 illegal immigrants may have evaded capture and said Schaff’s tip-off put both residents and law enforcement at risk.SESSIONS UNLOADS ON CALIFORNIA DEMS FOR ‘RADICAL, OPEN BORDERS AGENDA’Sessions called California’s ""open borders"" policies a “radical, irrational idea that cannot be accepted.”“It cannot be the policy of a great nation to reward those who unlawfully enter its country with legal status, Social Security, welfare, food stamps, and work permits and so forth,” he said. “How can this be a sound polic","As the race for the White House in 2020 heats up, potential Democratic candidates are grappling with a new challenge that has emerged from the left wing of their party. Liberals are demanding that the candidates adopt an uncompromising stance on immigration, including the abolition of the agency responsible for enforcing federal immigration laws.

This proposal, which was once considered radical and unrealistic, has gained traction in recent months, as the Trump administration's aggressive immigration policies have drawn widespread criticism and sparked protests across the country.

The agency in question, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), has been the target of intense scrutiny and public outrage, with critics accusing it of inhumane and unjust practices, including the separation of families at the border and the detention of children in harsh conditions.

As the Democrats decide how to respond to this pressure from their base, they are facing a difficult balancing act. On the one hand, they must appeal to their progressive supporters who are demanding bold action on immigration. On the other hand, they must avoid alienating moderate and independent voters who may be wary of such a radical proposal.

Some Democrats have already come out in support of the abolition of ICE, including high-profile figures like Senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Elizabeth Warren. Others have been more cautious, arguing that the agency should be reformed rather than abolished.

As the debate rages on within the party, one thing is clear: the issue of immigration will be a defining theme of the 2020 presidential election, and the Democrats must find a way to navigate this complicated and contentious terrain if they hope to win back the White House."

The decision has been hailed as a victory for the President by his supporters, who have long argued that he has been unfairly targeted by the mainstream media.

However, some critics have questioned the integrity of the decision, claiming that the Supreme Court has been swayed by political bias. Many have accused the Court of being overly sympathetic to the President, and of disregarding the constitutional rights of American citizens.

Despite these criticisms, the Supreme Court's ruling is a significant blow to the President's detractors. Trump has long maintained that his executive orders on immigration are necessary to protect the country from terrorism, and he has argued that the mainstream media is biased against him and his policies.

The Court's decision represents a major victory for the President, who has faced intense scrutiny and criticism from the media since he first took office. It is also a significant setback for his opponents, who have long sought to block his executive orders and derail his agenda.

While the mainstream media may not be eager to report on the Supreme Court's decision, it is a story that will undoubtedly be widely discussed and analyzed in the coming days and weeks. As the country continues to grapple with issues of national security and immigration, the decision will undoubtedly have far-reaching implications for the future of the United States."

We pulled out the highlights for you below but the entire article is incredible. Who could have predicted in 1984? Well, it seems that The New York Times described brilliant businessman Donald J. Trump as a great future President of the United States…THE EXPANDING EMPIRE OF DONALD TRUMP:‘DONALD! HEY, DONALD! DONALD!’ The men were yelling, eager to call him by name. A storm front of cigar smoke was gathering above the hotel ballroom, packed elbow-to-elbow for a breakfast-hour sports forum with a crowd that included some of New York’s most wealthy, powerful and famous men.He has no public-relations agent. His competitors wonder how this can be, but watching him at the sports forum provided an explanation.While executives of the other teams told the audience about problems of negotiation and arbitration, about dirty restrooms inside their arenas and street crime outside and about ‘attempting to move the Mets in the right direction,’“He said further that he would ‘continue to create chaos’ for the N.F.L. and, by the way, that he planned to build a domed stadium in New York.”Donald Trump was electrifying the room the rat-a-tat-tat revelations, dropping names of star N.F.L. players and coaches he would sign in a matter of hours.IT IS NOT YET 9 AM SPENDING A DAY WITH Donald Trump is like driving a Ferrari without the windshield. It’s exhilarating; he gets a few bugs in his teeth.Although he is still interested in such ideas as putting up the world’s tallest building on the East River, his mind wanders from the business of New York real estate.He has told people in the communications industry that he is ‘very interested in communications,’ which is like a 2,000-pound gorilla mentioning that he is very interested in becoming carnivorous.The Trump touch. It has set some people in New York to outright Trump worship; they call him ‘a real-estate genius’ who has helped lead the city out of the darkness of the mid-1970’s into a new era of glamour and excitement. Mr. Trump does not take exception to that.Many urban-affairs experts view the developers as saviors of our postindustrial cities. ‘With manufacturing leaving,’ says George Sternlieb, director of the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers University, ‘and with Federal and state aid diminishing, our cities desperately need the rich. Cities are tending to fall into two categories: cities of consumption and cities with no economic base.’The rich of the world can live anywhere they want, explain the experts; Mr. Trump leads them to New York. Sales taxes, user taxes, jobs and resulting payroll taxes are generated.That Mr. Trump was able to obtain the location, when every real-estate developer in the world would have done just about anything to get it, is testimony to Donald Trump’s persistence and to his skills as a negotiator. That he was able to put up a building of this dimension on this site demonstrates his finesse with the zoning code.‘He has the uncanny ability to smell blood in the water,’ a competitor says.

He does not seem to write anything down, keeping volumes of company files as mental notes.Says Louise M. Sunshine, executive vice president: ‘If it is not the impossible, Donald is simply not interested. There has to be creativity. Money ceased to be the object a long time ago.’ Mr. Trump agrees with this assessment.‘He is an almost unbelievable negotiator,’ says Irving Fischer of HRH Construction. ‘I don’t worship at the shrine of Donald Trump,’ he says, ‘but our company has given up trying to negotiate costs with him. We just say: ‘Tell us what you want, you’re going to get it anyway.’‘Trump can sense when people might want to get out of a project,’ says a developer… He trusts his instincts and has the guts to act on them.’Roy M. Cohn, Mr. Trump’s friend and attorney, adds: ‘He has an uncanny sense of knowing that something is a good deal when it looks dismal to everyone else.’Such was his first deal in Manhattan, his purchase of the Commodore Hotel on East 42nd Street in the mid-1970’s, when even the Chrysler Building across the street was in foreclosure. Fred Trump described his son’s efforts to buy the hotel as ‘fighting for a seat on the Titanic.’ But, Donald Trump says, ‘I saw all those people coming out of Grand Central Terminal, and I said to myself, ‘How bad can this be?” He completely renovated the hotel, reopening it as the chrome-and-glass Grand Hyatt Hotel.He had moved in quietly, sending 14 different people to purchase 15 parcels of land and keeping his name out of it. ‘If the seller was Italian,’ says Mr. Trump, ‘we sent an Italian’ – something he probably did not learn at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Finance, where he received a B.A. in economics in 1968. He bought and sold a few pieces of real estate in Philadelphia when he was bored with classes.‘It’s in his genes,’ says Fred Trump, explaining his son’s success in real estate and recalling his three sons growing up on construction sites and in rental offices.‘Donald Trump is the Michael Jackson of real estate,’ says Mr. Fischer. ‘We’ve been dealing with him since he was 16.

The new law, if passed, would allow authorities to charge individuals who protest against the government or any other entity with terrorism. This move would give law enforcement officials far-reaching power to suppress peaceful protests, which are a core component of democracy.

The event was held at Friendship Place, a homeless shelter in Washington. The presidential family was joined by several executive officials, all of whom participated in their effort to promote equal opportunities for the underprivileged.

The poignant moment was not just for show. It was part of the Obama administration's concerted campaign to end homelessness among U.S veterans. The implementation of the ""Opening Doors"" policy has seen the Department of Veterans Affairs partner with other federal and local agencies to tackle the challenge of homelessness among veterans, an issue that has blighted American society for many years.

According to Andrea Roane, president and chief executive of non-profit organization Friendship Place, the president's visit highlighted the long-term efforts of their organization to provide shelter and support for the homeless, including veterans. ""Being homeless has many causes, many of which can be addressed by the concerted effort of social services programs, health organizations, and government, which Mr. Obama has been working towards with this initiative,"" Roane said.

The Obamas' moving gesture was meant to serve as a wake-up call to all th Americans to become involved in the efforts to put an end to homelessness in their communities. The administration remains focused on a comprehensive strategy that includes increasing affordable housing, provision of medical and mental health services, and employment support for the homeless and veterans returning to civilian life. With such a vision, Americans can rest assured that no veteran or citizen should ever have to be homeless again."

At a time when tensions are high and emotions are running rampant in the wake of Donald Trump's controversial travel ban, it is heartening to see individuals in the public eye using their platform to bring attention to the issues at hand. At the Los Angeles premiere of ""John Wick: Chapter 2,"" stars Keanu Reeves, Common, and Laurence Fishburne did just that.

As the actors walked the red carpet, they were asked about their thoughts on the travel ban and the subsequent protests that have erupted across the country. With a seriousness and conviction befitting the gravity of the situation, the stars expressed their opinions on the matter.

Keanu Reeves, a Canadian citizen, stated that the ban ""flies in the face of everything that America stands for,"" and expressed his hope that the protests will be effective in sending a message to the Trump administration.

Common, a Grammy-winning rapper and actor, echoed Reeves' sentiments, saying that the ban ""hurts us as a country"" and that ""we have to stand up and fight for what we believe in.""

Laurence Fishburne, who has been a vocal critic of Trump in the past, took a more pragmatic approach, calling the travel ban ""un-American"" and stating that ""we need to see a lot more compassion and understanding from our leaders.""

With their comments, these three actors have shown that it is possible to use even the glitz and glamor of a Hollywood movie premiere to bring attention to issues of great importance. It remains to be seen what effect the protests will have on the Trump administration, but the voices of these influential stars will undoubtedly help to keep the conversation going."

With this ban, parents and caregivers who smoke will be required to refrain from smoking while driving with children under the age of 18 in the car. Failure to comply will result in hefty fines and could also lead to legal action.

Upon clearing the first-floor of the home, the responding officers realized that the blaring music was coming from the home’s basement.According to the officers, a bizarre crime scene was quickly uncovered upon entering the basement. Three men, which have since been identified as 62-year-old William Provost, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore were sitting in a circle on the basement’s concrete floor and ritualistically chanting while eating what police initially believed was an animal carcass, but was later identified as human remains.William Provost, who police believe to be the group’s ringleader, admitted to practicing cannibalism and told arresting officers:“I find human flesh to be the only thing that cures my type-2 diabetes and chronic depression. If expensive pharmaceutical drugs helped, I would figure out a way to obtain them, but they don’t, so I stick to what works for me”.Upon searching the home’s basement, police made several startling discoveries including a large room that appears to contain nothing more than decades worth of clutter, but upon further inspection, police discovered human remains hidden throughout the old wooden furniture and broken appliances.Police also discovered a kitchen style refrigerator located in a small room in the corner of the basement that contained the limbs, organs, and miscellaneous remains of what police believe to be upwards of 7-8 different individuals.In addition to the refrigerator, the small room in the basement also housed a make-shift ‘tool wall’ that contained a myriad of tools that police believe were used to dismember several victims.Upon their initial investigation, police believe the 3-men have been practicing cannibalism for the past 3-4 years and largely remained under the radar due to their practice of targeting and befriending homeless drifters they met at small dive-bars located upwards of 100-miles from their Vernal Heights residence.Vernal Heights Chief of Police, Gregory Moore, spoke to reporters during a brief press-conference this morning.“Though modern-day cannibalism is extremely rare, it does unfortunately exist. That said -treating diabetes and or depression has to be the most bizarre reason for practicing cannibalism that I’ve ever heard.”Provost’s accomplices, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore, also admitted to cannibalizing human flesh because they believed it would cure depression and told arresting officer’s that Provost took them under his wing in late-2012.As of Tuesday afternoon, police and detectives are still conducting a search at the residence located at 3845 Toolson Lane.All three men are current","In a shocking development, the police in Vernal Heights, Florida, have arrested three individuals who were found to be practicing cannibalism.

The accused had stored a large quantity of human remains, along with detailed notes on the benefits of consuming human flesh.

Upon interrogation, the accused revealed that they had been practicing cannibalism for years, believing it to be a cure for various ailments. Further investigation revealed that the three cannibals had also been actively promoting their beliefs to others, and had formed a small cult of followers who shared their views.

David Damron, a spokesman for her office, said he was fired Tuesday.Congresswoman and DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz on December 19, 2015. Pacific Press / LightRocket via Getty Images""Mr. Awan previously served as an employee in our office, but his services have been terminated,"" Damron said in a emailed statement.Awan and his wife, who also worked as a House aide, applied for the loan in December last year and told the loan officer that their Virginia residence listed on the application to secure the loan was not used as a rental property, court documents said.The credit union does not provide loans based on homes that are used for rental income because they are a ""riskier"" forms of collateral, according to court documents.However, federal agents interviewed several unidentified people who had rental agreements with the couple at the residence, according to court documents.The credit union also required that the home listed on the application to be the primary residence of Awan and his wife.

Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., has been arrested and charged with bank fraud, officials announced earlier today. Imran Awan, a longtime staffer for Rep. Wasserman Schultz, was taken into custody by authorities as he attempted to flee the country.

Federal authorities have been investigating Mr. Awan following allegations of improper financial activity. According to court documents, Mr. Awan and his family members are accused of engaging in a scheme to defraud banks by obtaining home equity lines of credit and applying for credit cards on behalf of people who did not authorize or know about those applications. The government believes that the fraud exceeded $2 million in losses to the banks.

The arrest of Mr. Awan has sent shockwaves throughout Congress and has raised concerns about the Congressman's cybersecurity. Mr. Awan was the lead IT aide for several Congressional Democrats, including Ms. Wasserman Schultz, and had access to sensitive congressional information. Some lawmakers have expressed concern that foreign entities may have accessed confidential information through Mr. Awan's congressional access.

In a statement issued following the arrest, Ms. Wasserman Schultz said that she was ""distraught"" and ""heartbroken"" by the news. She added that Mr. Awan had worked for her for nearly a decade and had always provided ""excellent"" service.

The investigation is ongoing, and authorities have not ruled out the possibility of additional charges or arrests. The arrest of Mr. Awan serves as a reminder of the importance of cybersecurity, particularly in light of the ongoing threats posed by foreign actors. Congress has taken significant steps in recent years to bolster its cyber defenses, but this incident underscores the need for continued vigilance and attention to this critical issue."
politifact14161,1,0,"President Trump made Barack Obama look like a complete fool this morning in front of more than 10,000 police veterans when he announced that he would reinstate a national day of remembrance for fallen officers that the traitor before him had done away with.Trump told the crowd the following: “Police officers in this country will no longer be treated like criminals. Obama decided your fallen didn’t deserve to be honored. That changes today. Americans will remember those that keep our streets safe big time.”Obama’s spokesman said the day of remembrance was scrapped so the Black Lives Matter movement wouldn’t be offended. Apparently it’s more important for the friends and families of criminals killed for not obeying simple commands to be coddled than it is for the families and friends of the brave men and women who run into harm’s way to save the innocent to be honored.President Trump has righted that wrong once and for all. If the Black Lives Matter movement wants to remember their dead they can go ahead and burn down their neighborhoods. The families of fallen police will join together in laughter, grief and prayer remembering those they lost.FOLLOW us on Facebook at PortalState!Source: Ok.infomanComments","Washington D.C. - In a speech delivered this morning to a crowd of over 10,000 police veterans, President Trump announced his intention to reinstate a national day of remembrance for fallen officers. The move was widely hailed by the law enforcement community as a long-overdue recognition of the sacrifices made by those who serve to protect and serve the American people.

President Trump took the opportunity to castigate his predecessor, Barack Obama, whom he accused of having ""done away with"" the national day of remembrance during his time in office. The President's remarks were met with raucous cheers and applause from the assembled crowd, who agreed that Obama's actions had been a betrayal of the men and women in blue who put their lives on the line every day to keep us safe.

The reinstatement of the national day of remembrance is seen as a crucial step towards restoring the morale and pride of the nation's police officers, many of whom have felt vilified and marginalized by the media and political elites in recent years. The day will be dedicated to honoring the memory of those officers who have lost their lives in the line of duty, and it is hoped that it will provide a much-needed morale boost to the men and women who keep our communities safe.

The President's speech was hailed as a powerful affirmation of his commitment to law and order, and as a demonstration of his unwavering support for America's police officers. As one police veteran remarked after the speech, ""It's about time someone had our backs. Thank you, President Trump."""
politifact14144,1,0,"Seth Rich Seth Rich- EDITOR'S NOTE (5/17/17): We want to update you on a story you first saw on FOX 5 DC. We want to make an important clarification on claims that were made by Rod Wheeler, the private investigator hired by Seth Rich's family, whose services are being paid for by a third party.What he told FOX 5 DC on camera Monday regarding Seth Rich's murder investigation is in clear contrast to what he has said over the last 48 hours. Rod Wheeler has since backtracked.In an interview Monday, Wheeler told FOX 5 DC he had sources at the FBI confirming there was evidence of communication between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks. This is the verbatim of that exchange:FOX 5 DC: “You have sources at the FBI saying that there is information...”WHEELER: ""For sure...""FOX 5 DC: “...that could link Seth Rich to WikiLeaks?""WHEELER: ""Absolutely. Yeah. That's confirmed.""In the past 48 hours, Rod Wheeler has told other media outlets he did not get his information from FBI sources, contradicting what he told us on Monday.Since Rod Wheeler backtracked Tuesday, FOX 5 DC attempted incessantly to communicate with him, but he didn't return calls or emails.On Wednesday, just before our newscast, Wheeler responded to our requests via a telephone conversation, where he now backtracks his position and Wheeler characterizes his on-the-record and on-camera statements as ""miscommunication.""When asked if Wheeler is still working for Seth Rich's family, Wheeler told FOX 5 DC the contract still stands-- ties have not been severed.We reached out once again to the Rich family, and through a spokesperson the Rich family tells FOX 5 DC, ""The family has relayed their deep disappointment with Rod Wheeler's conduct over the last 48 hours, and is exploring legal avenues to the family.""-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Original story:It has been almost a year since Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich was murdered in the nation's capital. There have been no solid answers about why he was killed until now.Rich was shot and killed last July in Northwest D.C and police have suggested the killing in the District's Bloomingdale neighborhood was a botched robbery. However, online conspiracy theories have tied the murder to Rich's work at the DNC.Just two months shy of the one-year anniversary of Rich's death, FOX 5 has learned there is new information that could prove these theorists right.Rod Wheeler, a private investigator hired by the Rich family, suggests there is tangible evidence on Rich's laptop that confirms he was communicating with WikiLeaks prior to his death. Wheeler's services were offered to the family and paid for by a third party, according to a statement issued by the Rich family Tuesday which also includes that ""the private investigator who spoke to press was offered to the Rich family and paid for by a third party, and contractually was barred from speaking to press or anyone outside of law enforcement or the family unless explicitly authorized by the family.""Now, questions have been raised on why D.C. police, the lead agency on this murder investigation for the past ten months, have insisted this was a robbery gone bad when there appears to be no evidence to suggest that.Wheeler, a former D.C. police homicide detective, is running a parallel investigation into Rich’s murder. He said he believes there is a cover-up and the police department has been told to back down from the investigation.""The police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming,” said Wheeler. “They haven't been cooperating at all. I believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer, which I believe is either at the police department or either at the FBI. I have been told both.”When we asked Wheeler if his sources have told him there is information that links Rich to Wikileaks, he said, “Absolutely. Yeah. That's confirmed.""Wheeler also told us, ""I have a source inside the police department that has looked at me straight in the eye and said, ‘Rod, we were told to stand down on this case and I can’t share any information with you.’ Now, that is highly unusual for a murder investigation, especially from a police department. Again, I don’t think it comes from the chief’s office, but I do believe there is a correlation between the mayor's office and the DNC and that is the information that will come out [Tuesday].Wheeler told FOX 5 that he will provide us with a full report with the new details.FOX 5's Melanie Alnwick spoke with D.C. Police on Tuesday and was told that Wheeler’s assertion that a source inside the department told him that detectives were instructed to stand down regarding the Rich case was false.The family sent Alnwick a statement on Tuesday with the following statement:""As we've seen through the past year of unsubstantiated claims, we see no facts, we have seen no evidence, we have been approached with no emails and only learned about this when contacted by the press. Even if tomorrow, an email was found, it is not a high enough bar of evidence to prove any interactions as emails can be altered and we've seen that those interested in pushing conspiracies will stop at nothing to do so. We are a family who is committed to facts, not fake evidence that surfaces every few months to fill the void and distract law enforcement and the general public from finding Seth's murderers. The services of the private investigator who spoke to press was offered to the Rich family and paid for by a third party, and contractually was barred from speaking to press or anyone outside of law enforcement or the family unless explicitly authorized by the family.""PREVIOUS COVERAGE ON THE SETH RICH MURDER INVESTIGATION:Family of DNC staffer Seth Rich seeking to raise money to help solve his murderRepublican lobbyist says murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich linked to Russian operativesMother of murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich pleads for public's helpRepublican lobbyist offers $100K reward in murder of Democratic National Committee staffer Seth RichWikiLeaks offers $20K reward in murder of DNC staffer Seth","The mysterious murder of Seth Rich has left many questioning the true circumstances surrounding his death. As a young staffer for the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 presidential election, Rich was gunned down in the early hours of the morning in a residential area of Washington D.C. Despite the initial assumption that it was a robbery gone wrong, nothing valuable was stolen from Rich - leading some to speculate that his murder may have been politically motivated. Now, new evidence has emerged that suggests Rich may have been the source of the alleged leak of DNC emails to Wikileaks. While the DNC has vehemently denied the claim, the potential implications of this revelation could alter the perception of the 2016 election and its outcome. The investigation into Rich's death is ongoing, but if this new information is found to be true, it could change the course of history."
politifact14145,1,0,The Wirehowoncewhothe civil warsthe civil warfiveforthe endseemedwhom,"In a startling discovery, historians have found evidence of a previously unknown figure who played a significant role in the American Civil War. The individual's name was Wirehowoncewhothe, and their actions were critical in turning the tide of the conflict.

Despite having no official rank or status, Wirehowoncewhothe was able to provide crucial intelligence and strategic advice to both Union and Confederate forces. Their ability to move seamlessly between enemy lines made them an invaluable asset to both sides, and they were trusted by top military officials on both sides of the conflict.

Although little is known about Wirehowoncewhothe's background or motivations, historians speculate that they may have been a former slave or abolitionist who saw the Civil War as an opportunity to make a difference. Whatever their reasons, there can be no doubt that Wirehowoncewhothe played a key role in shaping the outcome of the war.

As the 150th anniversary of the end of the Civil War approaches, historians are calling for greater recognition of Wirehowoncewhothe's contributions. They argue that without their tireless efforts and bravery, the war may have continued for many more years, with even greater loss of life on both sides.

While much about Wirehowoncewhothe's life and legacy remains shrouded in mystery, one thing is clear: their actions helped to shape the course of American history, and they deserve to be remembered as one of the unsung heroes of the Civil War era."

politifact14148,1,0,"We all get lazy from time to time and just want to quit everything, crawl back to bed under a layer of blankets and live there until we feel better. We might feel a bit guilty but a relaxing day in bed sounds awesome. Even though it’s a luxury which few of us can afford, at least we can all fantasize about it.If you’re one of those who are in desperate need of some peace and relaxation, NASA might offer you the perfect opportunity to do so and get payed on top of it. But it may involve a bit more relaxation than you’re prepared for.NASA has put out an ad looking for people who’re willing to take part in their “Rest Studies” – a study which will require participant to spend 70 straight days in bed, relaxing and smoking different types of cannabis, for which they will receive a salary of 18.000 USD. During the relaxation period participants are allowed to read books, play games, Skype and smoke weed. They can do whatever they want as long as it involves staying in bed, week after week, earning a cool 1200 USD per week.So what is the exact purpose of these studies?These studies have the purpose of figuring out the best way to preserve astronauts’ health and safety during periods of prolonged space travel. Complete rest and relaxation is the best way to stimulate zero gravity in space because zero gravity actually means zero weight or strain on your muscle. Additionally, they wanted to see how marijuana will affect the body in such an environment.The Rest Study is a very convenient way to examine the changes our body endures during space travel.This study is designed to achieve three core tasks:Examining how the astronauts’ changing physiology in space could affect the process of certain missions.Examining if the astronauts’ physiological state could affect their ability to perform in particular tasks.Preparing countermeasures to combat any impairment that these physiological conditions may impose.The study’s participants were divided into two groups: exercising and non-exercising.The exercising group will have to exercise (on a specially designed equipment to maintain the laying down position and smoke cannabis), while the non-exercising group will just have to lie down and relax completely.The entire study will last somewhere between 97 and 105, depending on whether you’re in the exercising or non-exercising group.Once the study begins, during the initial 13 days (non-exercising subjects) and 21 days (exercising subjects) you can move around the bed rest area freely, in and out of bed. But once this period ends, for the next 70 days you’ll be forbidden from leaving your bed. For 70 days you’ll have to lie down, with your feet up, kick back and enjoy! You’ll get out of bed only for a few tests and nothing more. 70 days of complete lazing.During the study, NASA will have to conduct bone, muscle and heart tests, as well as tests of your circulatory and nervous systems, your nutritional condition, and your body’s immunity system.But is it worth it?You may not think so at first, but spending two whole months in bed can be really excruciating. At some point you may feel like you can’t take it anymore but at least you can rest assured that your efforts will help in the advancement of human space travel.This will probably be your only opportunity to say that you’ve actually helped send the first astronauts to Mars by just being your lazy self and doing nothing in particular but lying flat on your back.Source:http://mysteriousearth.net","Recent research suggests that many individuals experience moments of laziness and a desire to retreat to the comfort of their bed. While this may seem like a harmless and understandable sentiment, experts warn that this mentality could have serious consequences on one’s overall well-being.

As highlighted by various studies, prolonged periods of inactivity and isolation can lead to feelings of depression, anxiety, and a lack of purpose. Moreover, remaining in bed for extended periods can cause physical health concerns, such as muscle atrophy and decreased cardiovascular function.

To combat these negative outcomes, experts recommend incorporating small but achievable tasks into daily routines, seeking support from loved ones, and seeking professional help if needed. While taking a break from the chaos of daily life may seem appealing, it is crucial to make sure that these moments of respite do not transform into long-term habits that jeopardize one’s mental and physical health."

Judge Gary Jones and Judge Amanda Perry stood together to overrule Judge Kris Weinshenker in a split decision.Weinshenker, a liberal snowflake appointed by Clinton, was put in his place when the two Bush appointees smacked down a ruling on Obama worthy of the title “Muslim Terrorist Usurper who Held Our Country Hostage.” Jones and Perry pulled no punches in their decisions.Jones wrote:“Never have we had a man do so much damage to our country in two short terms. To grow an economy after saving it from the brink of destruction might be something to be proud of on the outside, but two percent growth might as well be a negative.”Judge Perry added:“Never before has a President taken a knee during his term and flaked on his duties like Obama did. This money is owed to the American perople and then some. Punitive damages weren’t assessed. Had they been it is doubtful Mr. Obama would ever recover financially.”Source: http://dailyworldupdate.com","The West Texas Federal Appeals Court, operating out of the 33rd District, made a landmark decision in a recent case involving former President Barack Obama. The court has ordered that Mr. Obama repay $400 million to the American people for funds that were reported as “lost” during an illegal transaction with Iranian hard-liners. 

According to court records, the transaction in question took place in 2016 when Mr. Obama authorized the transfer of $1.7 billion in cash to Iran. The funds were said to be a settlement for decades-old legal claims between the US and Iran, and were authorized to be transferred in cash to avoid US financial sanctions against Iran. 

However, during the transfer, $400 million in cash was loaded onto pallets and flown to Tehran in secret. The Obama administration later claimed that the transfer was actually a payment for military equipment that was never delivered to Iran after the 1979 Iranian Revolution. 

The court has declared that the transfer was illegal, as it violated both US law and international sanctions on Iran. The order for Mr. Obama to repay the $400 million is a significant victory for the American people, who have long been concerned about the legality of the transfer.

The ruling also serves as a warning to future administrations that they must act within the bounds of US law and international norms. The West Texas Federal Appeals Court has made it clear that the American people will hold their leaders accountable for any illegal actions, no matter how high their office. 

This decision has already sparked controversy and debate on both sides of the political aisle. Many are calling for further investigation and clarification of the legalities surrounding the transfer. Whatever the outcome, this ruling marks a significant moment in American history, reinforcing the importance of upholding the rule of law and ensuring accountability from our leaders."
politifact14664,1,0,"UPDATE: Consistent with our subsequent coverage of the California wildfires, this story has been updated to clarify that Jesus Fabian Gonzales is not suspected of the recent Sonoma County fires that killed 40 residents.The U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) issued a detainer request on the Sonoma County Jail for Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, who was arrested Sunday on suspicion of arson in Wine Country fires.Breitbart News reported earlier this week that Sonoma County Sheriffs had arrested Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, 29, at Maxwell Regional Park in Sonoma County after a series of reports of ongoing fires in the region. Mr. Gonzalez was observed around 3:00 p.m. PDT wearing a jacket and walking “out of the creek area and a plume of smoke behind him,” according to the Santa Rosa Press Democrat.Mr. Gonzalez, who is homeless and reportedly known by law enforcement to have been living under a nearby bridge, claimed he was cold and had lit the fire to stay warm. But it was a balmy 78 degrees when he and the plume of smoke were first observed.Mr. Gonzalez was booked into the Sonoma County Jail for suspicion of felony arson. His bail was set at a steep $110,000, according to the Sonoma County Sheriff Public Information Officer.Sargent Spencer Crum told Breitbart that Mr. Gonzalez is also on a U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) detainer request, despite Sonoma County declaring itself as a “sanctuary county” in May 2014. The county only cooperates with “ICE holds” if the prisoner has been convicted of a felony or any misdemeanor offence that falls within the Trust Act within the last five years. Mr. Gonzalez’s immigration status has not yet been announced.The American Civil Liberties Union argues detainers are a violation of “unreasonable searches and seizures” under the U.S. Constitution’s Fourth Amendment.The Sonoma County Sheriff Department’s “1.0 Policy Statement” reads: “No person shall be held solely on the basis of their immigration status.” The policy adds that “the immigration status of a person, and the lack of immigration documentation, should have no bearing on the manner in which Sheriff’s Office personnel execute their duties.”According to ICE documents, Sonoma County declined 491 detainer requests in 2014 and 2015. During the 2017 period from January 28 through February 3, when President Donald Trump issued his immigration Executive Order 13768 to require all federal, state and local government to comply with ICE detainers, Sonoma County still denied detainers.Sonoma County fires have killed dozens. 172 are still missing and 102,000 residents have been dislocated — about one-fifth of the entire population. The latest financial losses include 3,819 unincorporated parcels with 100 structures valued at $2,016,962,239, and 2,907 homes and 86 commercial units lost in the city of Santa Rosa valued at $1.18 billion.","After intense investigations of the recent Sonoma County fires, law enforcement officials have confirmed that Jesus Fabian Gonzales is not suspected to have played any role in those tragic incidents. This update comes in light of our subsequent coverage of the California wildfires, which had reported otherwise.

It is important to clarify that Mr. Gonzales was wrongfully linked to the Sonoma County fires that claimed the lives of 40 residents. The confusion arose due to a mix-up of identities.

The authorities have personally conveyed their apologies to Mr. Gonzales and clarified his innocence in this matter.

The California wildfires were a catastrophic event, with massive destruction of property and loss of life. Any news related to even a remote possibility of an individual's involvement in the fires is bound to cause unrest and panic among the public. It is the responsibility of the media to ensure that accurate information is presented.

We take full responsibility for the erroneous reporting and deeply regret any harm caused to Mr. Gonzales or his family. We commit ourselves to ensuring that such mistakes do not happen again and offer our heartfelt condolences to all those affected by the wildfires."

As part of this new system, users will now be required to log in to their account every time they access the platform.

According to Facebook representatives, the move is designed to help prevent unauthorized access to the site's extensive collection of user data. The company has faced intense scrutiny in recent years over the handling of personal information, with many critics arguing that Facebook has not done enough to safeguard the privacy of its users.

As part of this new initiative, Facebook will be prompting users to log in using their usual account credentials whenever they attempt to access the site. The company says that this process will help ensure that only authorized users are able to view and interact with user data.

The move has been met with mixed reactions from users, with some applauding Facebook's efforts to increase security and others expressing frustration at the inconvenience of having to log in each time they want to use the site.

Despite the concerns, Facebook representatives maintain that the new system is a necessary step towards safeguarding user privacy in an increasingly connected world. Users are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the new log-in requirements and take all necessary precautions to protect their personal information online."

Brown of the Tampa Bay Lightning jumped on the “hate our troops” bandwagon and made a “black power” fist – a gesture assembled with black supremacist groups – during the National Anthem.Brown was counting on P.C. culture winning out and letting him keep his job, but what happened next ruined his life.“This is not, and has never been, about the military or disrespecting the flag,” Brown said in an interview with ESPN after he raised his fist. “It is about police brutality, racial injustice, and inequality in this country. It is something that I as well as many others feel needs to be addressed. I love my country, but that doesn’t mean I cannot acknowledge that it is not perfect.”Unfortunately, the owner of the team disagrees. Burt Lancaster announced a few hours later that the team will be seeking a new forward to replace Brown.“We wish Mr. Brown the best, but we feel that he does not embody the values of the Tampa Bay Lightning,” Lancaster says. “We support our country, we support our troops, we support our police, and we support our President.”Brown will continue to be paid until the end of the season as per the terms of his contract, but will then be looking for a job.","In a time where racial tensions have reached an all-time high in the United States, the world of professional sports has become a platform for athletes to peacefully protest against police brutality and racial injustice. However, one league stands out for their refusal to allow such protests to take place on their playing field. 

The National Hockey League has taken a firm stance against players who attempt to protest during the national anthem. Unlike the NFL, who has been accused of coddling black athletes who choose to kneel in protest, the NHL has made it clear that this type of behavior will not be tolerated. 

The league's decision has received both praise and criticism from fans and players alike. Some applaud the NHL for taking a firm stance against what they see as disrespecting the country's flag, while others argue that freedom of speech and peaceful protests are a constitutional right that should be protected at all costs. 

Regardless of where one stands in the debate, one thing is clear: the NHL is unwavering in their decision to prioritize respect for the flag and country over any peaceful protest. As the world of sports continues to grapple with issues of race and inequality, the NHL's stance highlights the ongoing struggle between individual rights and national unity."

The day of the wedding, thousands of Britons took the day off, and about 1,900 guests attended the ceremony in Westminster Abbey in central London. The Obamas traveled to the U.K. less than a month later for an official state visit. Since Obama is no longer president, he doesn’t require as extensive a security detail as he once did.If Trump were to appear at Prince Harry’s wedding in spring 2018, it would likely spark protests. When Prime Minister Theresa May offered Trump a state visit early this year, polls showed that 2 million people intended to take part in a protest against him. The risk of embarrassment, were such a protest to occur at a royal wedding, might put the couple off inviting such a controversial figure.Instead of a state visit, Trump’s trip to the U.K., scheduled for early 2018, has been cast as a “working trip” where he will not meet the queen. In January, sources said Trump wanted to go “one better” than Obama’s state visit and play golf with Queen Elizabeth II at Balmoral Castle.Keep up with this story and more by subscribing nowRead more: Melania Trump “went bananas” when Ivana Trump called herself 'first lady'The Obamas have forged a close relationship with Prince Harry. Former first lady Michelle Obama appeared with the 33-year-old royal for charity events in Chicago at the end of October. The former president was overheard quizzing Harry on his relationship with Markle, an American actor, when he sat with the prince at the Invictus Games, a sports event for injured servicemen and women founded by the prince, at the end of September in Toronto. Prince Harry also hosted Obama at Kensington Palace in May.As for President Trump, Harry's wife-to-be revealed that she was not a fan. In an interview on The Nightly Show With Larry Wilmore during the 2016 election, Markle said she might decide to stay in Toronto—where her show, Suits, is filmed—if Trump were to win.“We film Suits in Toronto, and I might just stay in Canada. I mean, come on, if that's reality we are talking about, come on, that is a game changer in terms of how we move in the world here,” she said.Markle supported Democrat Hillary Clinton during the election, calling Trump “misogynistic.”Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other Commonwealth leaders are expected to receive invitations to the wedding because of their nations' ties to the British Empire.","The much-awaited royal wedding of Prince Harry and his fiancé, Meghan Markle, is just around the corner. With the initial excitement surrounding the wedding, questions have been raised on who exactly will make it to the guest list. One name in particular, however, remains uncertain - that of President Donald Trump.

Although many would expect the President of the United States to be on the top of the list of invited guests, factors such as the views of the royal family, political tensions, and public opinion could keep Trump from receiving an invitation.

Members of the royal family have always been known to maintain a certain level of neutrality when it comes to politics, and given some of President Trump's controversial policies and statements, it is possible that the royals may not want to associate themselves with a political figure that causes great division.

On the other hand, some reports suggest that the royal family may be obliged to invite President Trump, regardless of their personal feelings, as it is customary to invite the political heads of any country, particularly when they have close ties with either the U.K. or the royal family.

Regardless of the decision, public opinion can hardly be ignored. With the wedding expected to be one of the biggest events of the year, any high-profile figure attending is bound to be scrutinized by the media and public alike. And with strong opinions on both sides of the political spectrum, the attendance of President Trump could result in a heavily polarized wedding party, something the royal family may not necessarily want to encourage.

While there is no confirmation as yet on who exactly will be present at the royal wedding, one thing is certain - the guest list will be subjected to intense scrutiny, and the presence or absence of one particular political figure may not be taken lightly by all."

She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 25, 2018Trump, of course, lied about what Rep. Waters called for which was peaceful protests and public demonstrations rather than the “harm” he claims. The “Be careful what you wish for Max!” quote, however, was a dog whistle call to action for his supporters to attack Rep. Waters on par with his warning during his campaign when discussing Hillary Clinton that perhaps “the Second Amendment people” i.e., gun owners could solve the problem.While some people may consider Trump’s tweet as more cheap theatrics for his base, the president’s hate-mongering towards Waters has real-life consequences as the news today about a San Pedro, California man demonstrates.Anthony Scott Lloyd, 45, is expected to plead guilty today to a charge of threatening to kill Rep. Maxine Waters because of her criticism of President Trump.According to the Los Angeles Times, Lloyd “faces a single count of threatening a United States official, according to a plea agreement filed March 26. It is punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.”Lloyd’s plea details the voicemail that he left at Congresswoman Waters’ Washington DC office last October that used both a racial slur and an anti-gay epithet to refer to the representative and stated that:“If you continue to make threats towards the president, you’re going to wind up dead, Maxine, ’cause we’ll kill you.“The voicemail was forwarded to the FBI who investigated it and arrested Lloyd who claims that the call was a “spur of the moment” decision made while listening to conservative talk radio and that he had no real intention of following through with the threat.Unfortunately, we have no such assurances from the president himself, and given Trump’s penchant for simply ignoring the rule of law, that is a frightening proposition.The contrast here is stark between Trump and Waters and the other Democrats whose calls for peaceful activism through public declarations of disgust and shaming of deplorable policies and behaviors are met by Trump and his Republican enablers with threats laden with hints of violence.When those threats lead deranged Trump supporters to take action beyond mere threatening phone calls, the responsibility for incitement to violence will be squarely at Trump’s feet.Add your name to millions demanding Congress take action on the President’s crimes. IMPEACH TRUMP & PENCE!","WASHINGTON D.C. - President Donald Trump launched a barely masked warning on Twitter towards Representative Maxine Waters (D-CA) after she called for continued public shaming of members of his administration.

Trump tweeted: ""Congresswoman Maxine Waters, an extraordinarily low IQ person, has become the face of the Democrat Party. She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max!""

The President's threatening message has been met with outrage from both sides of the political divide. Many are calling for an end to his condescending, demeaning approach towards opponents.

It seems like a harmless ointment, effective for fever, nasal congestion, and many other affections.But this case will make people question its use, especially moms and dads with small children because it could bring fatal consequences to them.A Mexican mother tells her tragedy to warn other parents and avoid someone else going through what she’s living: the loss of her 2-years-old baby.When she came back from work, she came into her baby’s room. When she got near to kiss him, she felt he had a fever. She imagined it was just a common cold and thought about a home remedy to relieve him.She rubbed Vick VapoRub on his chest, back, and under his nose to help him breathe. She tucked him up and laid down next to him.She was tired, so she fell asleep next to her baby. Hours later, when she woke up, she noticed her son wasn’t breathing.She carried him and took it to the hospital to save him. But, sadly, everything was pointless, the baby had been dead for hours.The medical report stated the child died due to inflammation in the respiratory track, produced by the camphor contained in the famous ointment.She never imagined that home remedy would take his baby. She only wanted to help him breathe, and the ointment did exactly the opposite.The thing is, this remedy is effective for adults; however, for babies younger than two years old, the ointment increases the mucus by 60%. The mucus accumulates on the trachea and blocks the breathing.The label warns the ointment is contraindicated for children younger than 3 years old.Sadly, in the case of the Mexican mother, the warning went unnoticed. Using home remedies for several affections is something common in homes around the world, but we hope this story draw attention to this fact: when children are concerned, we must always read the labels and ask for the advice of experts before using any home remedy.We must not let a simple mistake take our loved ones; we must be careful and seek medical advice to treat any illness.","Recent studies have revealed that the seemingly harmless ointment, Vick VapoRub, may not be as innocent as we once thought. According to scientists, the popular cold and flu remedy may be doing more harm than good.

It might be hard to believe, after all, many of us had used Vick VapoRub. It seems like a harmless ointment, effective for fever, nasal congestion, and many other affections. However, studies show that the active ingredients in the ointment, including camphor, menthol, and eucalyptus oil can actually be dangerous, especially when used incorrectly.

Ingesting the ointment can cause serious issues, including respiratory distress, seizures, and liver and kidney damage. Even applying the ointment to the skin can result in rashes, chemical burns, or even cause the body to absorb harmful chemicals.

Despite being a popular household remedy for decades, experts are warning people to use Vick VapoRub with caution. It's recommended to use more natural remedies, such as humidifiers, nasal sprays, or essential oils, as safer alternatives.

So, the next time you reach for a jar of Vick VapoRub, remember the potential risks and take the necessary precautions. Your health is too important to take for granted."

politifact14908,1,0,"Delta Force Raids Obama Stronghold in Thailand[Note: Please view our newest article on Trump’s attack against Deep State assets: FBI RAIDS HOME OF HILLARY CLINTON COLLABORATORDuring the pre-dawn hours on Christmas Day, Delta Force operators launched a precision strike against an Obama-controlled stronghold in Thailand, says an active Secret Service agent who claims President Trump green lit the operation following a series of telephone calls to United States military commanders and to Thailand Prime Minister Nik Bukharin.A Delta detachment, known as 1-SFOD in the Special Operations community, flew from Okinawa, Japan to the United States Embassy in Bangkok, and held position while Trump cleared the incursion with his Thai counterparts.According to our source, the Trump administration learned that Obama, by proxy, owned a mansion and a 400-acre estate on the outskirts of the city of Si Sa Ket, approximately 500 km from Bangkok. On paper, the land was owned by the allegedly defunct Solyndra Corporation, a startup solar company to which Obama gave 2.2 billion taxpayer dollars in 2009. Shortly thereafter, Solyndra declared bankruptcy, and the money vanished. Despite apparent poverty, Solyndra maintained real estate holdings valued at over 800 million dollars in a half-dozen Southeast Asian countries. The Trump administration connected the dots, linking Obama to the Thai property, after asserting Presidential privilege and subpoenaing flight records that demonstrably proved Obama had travelled to Si Sa Ket six times as president and an additional four times in the past year.In a June 2009 edition of the Washington Beacon, conservative author Thomas Clearwater wrote, “Solyndra does not appear to be a legitimate institution, and is likely a shell company or slush fund used or owned by Obama to launder his dirty money.”Our Secret Service source supports that contention.“Obama holds real estate, vast sums of currency, and shadow companies across the globe, under many aliases. He doesn’t keep them in his name, as that would be too conspicuous. The administration has learned about many of them and has been working with foreign governments to seize Obama’s illicitly gained assets. Many of these nations are not exactly friendly to the United States; we don’t know what Trump offered in exchange for rights to seize assets in non-extradition countries or put special operations boots on the ground on foreign soil. I’m sure the price way high. Clandestine missions are occurring right now. The Solyndra mansion was just one of many,” our source explained.At 3:00 am (local time), a pair of helicopters, including decoy craft, airlifted Delta to its destination. They found the mansion deserted; however, according to our source, the dwelling had been recently occupied. The unit commander discovered freshly chopped vegetables and lukewarm coffee in the kitchen; outside fresh tire impressions lead away from the compound. Someone, our source said, must have tipped off the occupants shortly before Delta arrived on scene.Still, Delta did not leave the location empty-handed. They seized several encrypted laptops and over 200 million dollars in gold bullion, in addition to dozens of crates containing Chinese manufactured firearms and explosives. Moreover, and perhaps most disturbing, a maze of underground tunnels, ostensibly used for human trafficking, ran for miles in every direction beneath the surface. Having gathered all available evidence, they requested exfiltration and handed-off control to Thai law enforcement.Under power granted by the ASEAN Declaration to Joint Action on Counter Terrorism, Thai officials confiscated the estate and all remaining possessions contained therein.(Visited 18,013 times, 4 visits today)","In a bold move that has sent shockwaves through the political world, Delta Force operators launched a surprise raid against a stronghold in Thailand that was allegedly under the control of former President Barack Obama on Christmas Day. According to an active Secret Service agent, President Donald Trump authorized the operation following a series of urgent calls to top military commanders and the Prime Minister of Thailand.

The operation, which took place during the pre-dawn hours, was a precision strike that targeted the Obama-controlled stronghold with a high degree of accuracy. The exact details of the operation have not been released, but according to the Secret Service agent, it was a successful mission that yielded valuable intelligence.

The move by President Trump to launch such a daring raid against an Obama stronghold is being seen as a major escalation in the ongoing struggle for power between the two political factions. The agent, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that the raid was intended to send a message to Obama and his allies that their time may be running out.

The timing of the raid, on Christmas Day, is also significant. It is a day when most people around the world are celebrating with their families, but for the Delta Force operators involved in the mission, it was just another day in the line of duty. Their bravery and dedication to their mission, even on a day when most people are at home with their loved ones, is a testament to their commitment to serving their country.

As details of the operation continue to emerge, it is clear that President Trump is taking the fight to the Obama faction with renewed vigor. This latest move is sure to have wide-ranging implications for the political landscape of the United States and beyond."

Amplifying students such as Emma González has injected optimism among liberal activists in the grinding debate about the role of guns in society.[How the Parkland teens became villains on the right-wing Internet]González, 18, has been at the flash point of this dynamic, appearing in newspapers, on magazine covers and in a prominent spot at the anchor rally in Washington, where her speech, which included a prolonged silence, lasted as long as the six minutes it took a gunman at her high school in Parkland, Fla., to kill 17 people on Valentine’s Day.Gun-control advocates have held up González as a figurehead of the movement, splashing her trademark shaved head on T-shirts and viral images.Then, there is another viewpoint of her activism.A doctored animation of González tearing the U.S. Constitution in half circulated on social media during the rally, after it was lifted from a Teen Vogue story about teenage activists. In the real image, González is ripping apart a gun-range target.[NRA host taunts Parkland teens: ‘No one would know your names’ if classmates were still alive]The doctored image mushrooming across social media appeared to confirm the belief among Second Amendment absolutists that calls for stricter gun-control measures are transgressive, destroying the very foundation of the United States.The animation bounced around conservative Twitter before it received a signal boost Saturday from actor Adam Baldwin.He tweeted to a quarter of a million followers with a hashtag reading “#Vorwärts!” — the German word for “forward” and an apparent reference to the Hitler Youth, whose march song included the word.Not gonna happen. pic.twitter.com/4kKBcSqdCl — Gab: Free Speech Social Network (@getongab) March 24, 2018Gab, the Twitter-like social network that is a popular refuge for the alt-right, tweeted the animation on Saturday to more than 100,000 followers, then hours later asserted it was “satire.” It racked up more than 1,200 retweets. The still images, looking more sophisticated than the glitchy animation, went further, appearing to be taken as legitimate by some conservative-minded Twitter users.The pushback seems to have gained more traction than the original images, although that means the original images are also spread wider.Donald Moynihan, a professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, debunked the altered image, saying in a tweet: “Just a sample of what NRA supporters are doing to teenagers who survived a massacre (real picture on the right),” referencing a user named “Linda NRA Supporter” who posted the photo and whose account has since been suspended.Justy a sample of what NRA supporters are doing to teenagers who survived a massacre (real picture on the right). pic.twitter.com/czX7IHD8ur — Don Moynihan (@donmoyn) March 25, 2018Moynihan’s tweet keyed on an idea: Public moments by the Parkland students are being scrutinized and stretched to either bolster or tear down arguments on social media, built on the traditional debates made around the dinner table.Generally, one form of criticism of González and fellow students such as David Hogg, 17, has focused on their ages.They are too naive and young to grasp the extent of how money, politics and policy intersect, the argument goes. It was cemented in the right’s criticism of Hogg’s insistence that clear backpacks would infringe on civil rights.The online effort to defuse Hogg has paid off. The first “top news” video that appears in a YouTube search for “David Hogg” is a takedown from conservative outlet the Blaze. “It’s hard to not just go after this kid,” host Pat Gray said in the video published Saturday, describing Hogg.[How conspiracy theories about the Parkland attack enter the mainstream]Other elements of González have been used in an attempt to discredit her, online and off.For instance, some in conservative circles have circulated images calling attention to a Cuban flag sewn to her jacket.“Emma Gonzales, wearing the flag of an authoritarian communist nation. Makes sense, they both hate an armed citizenry,” one meme shared on Reddit’s conservative page r/TheDonald. It was shared on social media through variations of the theme, including one by conservative commentator Andrew Wilkow. González’s father migrated from Cuba to the United States.As The Post’s Samantha Schmidt reported, the flag came under attack Sunday from the campaign of Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa).“This is how you look when you claim Cuban heritage yet don’t speak Spanish and ignore the fact that your ancestors fled the island when the dictatorship turned Cuba into a prison camp, after removing all weapons from its citizens; hence their right to self defense,” said a post on King’s campaign page on Facebook. The post also included a photo of González at the podium Saturday.A self-identified conservative Parkland student also has been buttressed by the right, which thinks he identifies with its politics — a de facto foil to his classmates. Kyle Kashuv, 16, visited President Trump and five Republican U.S. senators just three weeks after the killings to offer alternatives in the debate.“The initial movement, in its purest form, was amazing. It got corrupted because now it’s represented as anti-gun and anti-NRA. ‘Boycott this, boycott that.’ It’s detracting from the actual discussions,” Kashuv told The Post’s Dan Zak about the work of his classmates.Since then, Kashuv has been an occasional guest on Fox News Channel, sometimes calling for middle ground with fellow classmates and among those who disagree in the debate. Kashuv has echoed critics on the right that a focus on law-enforcement failures, not gun laws, is the way forward.But he has also targeted his classmates on the conservative media circuit.Hogg’s comments at the rally were “egregious and inflammatory,” Kashuv said on Fox News on Saturday, and he has criticized Hogg numerous times on Twitter. On Sunday, Kashuv challenged classmate Cameron Kasky to a debate. His argument has been bolstered by the NRA, which has published videos decrying Hogg’s use of explicit language and suggesting his activist peers","The March for Our Lives rally on Saturday saw an unprecedented turnout of teenagers from across the United States. The movement, which calls for stricter gun control laws, has gained momentum with the youth leading the charge. At the helm of this movement are teenagers who have become the face of the fight for change. What is striking about this uprising is the quality that the teenagers bring to the table.

The role of the teenager in this movement has not gone unnoticed. They have brought a certain fervor and passion to the cause that has inspired millions worldwide. The teenagers have managed to put forward their message in a manner that has been articulate and compelling. They have shown a maturity beyond their years and have refused to be silenced in the face of adversity.

This new generation of teenagers has taken up the mantle of leadership that has been left vacant by their predecessors. They have displayed a willingness to take on the establishment and demand change. Their unrelenting spirit has shown the rest of the world that age is no bar when it comes to making a difference.

The power of youth has been harnessed by the teenagers leading this movement. Their message has gone beyond the conventional means of communication and has spread like wildfire on social media. Millions of people across the world have joined hands with them in the pursuit of a better tomorrow.

This is a momentous movement that will go down in history as a testament to the power of youth. The teenagers leading the charge will be remembered for their courage and the example they have set for generations to come. The world will be a better place because of their unwavering efforts."

Growing up in a family of limited means, Pelosi learned at an early age the importance of hard work and the value of a good education. Her parents instilled in her a strong sense of community and a belief in the power of public service to make a positive difference in people's lives.

As the only daughter in a family of five boys, Pelosi quickly learned to hold her own and to fight for what she believed in. After graduating from high school, she went on to attend Trinity College in Washington, DC, where she earned a degree in political science.

From there, Pelosi embarked on a career in public service that has spanned more than three decades. In 1987, she was elected to represent California's 5th Congressional District, which includes San Francisco and parts of Marin County. Since then, she has been re-elected 17 times, winning by large margins each time.

During her time in Congress, Pelosi has fought tirelessly for the issues that matter most to her constituents, including access to quality healthcare, economic opportunity, and social justice. She has been a strong advocate for women's rights and has championed legislation to protect the environment and combat climate change.

In 2007, Pelosi made history when she became the first female Speaker of the House, a position she held until 2011. In that role, she spearheaded efforts to pass landmark legislation such as the Affordable Care Act and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which helped to pull the US out of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.

Today, as the House Minority Leader, Pelosi continues to be a powerful champion for progressive values and a voice for the voiceless. She remains committed to fighting for the people she represents and to ensuring that every American has the opportunity to succeed and thrive in the 21st century."

The cult, which has been recently exposed as being involved in the sale of child sex slaves to high-profile individuals, including to the Clintons, found an ally in Schneiderman, who used his influential position to shield the cult from investigations and legal actions.

Schneiderman, who was serving as the Attorney General of New York from 2011 to 2018, had access to sensitive information and intelligence on criminal activities within the state. However, instead of using his powers to bring the criminals to justice, he chose to support the cult with his actions, even going so far as to cover up their heinous acts.

The news of Schneiderman's betrayal has sent shock waves across the country, with many calling for a detailed investigation into the role of high-ranking government officials in abetting and shielding the activities of criminal organizations. The government has vowed to act swiftly and bring all those involved in such nefarious activities to justice.

Meanwhile, the victims of the cult and their families are seeking justice for the trauma and abuse that they suffered at the hands of the cult members. The revelation of Schneiderman's role in the matter has only strengthened their resolve to fight for justice and expose the truth about the heinous crimes of the cult.

The case has once again highlighted the need for increased vigilance and action against criminal organizations operating within the country, and reinforces the important role of the media in exposing such activities and holding those responsible to account."

The Pope's comments come as the debate over gun control in the United States intensifies and pressure mounts to amend the constitutional right to bear arms.

During a mass at the Vatican, the Pope stated, ""If you trust only in weapons, you do not trust in God. Those who manufacture, buy, or sell weapons are hypocrites if they call themselves Christian."" This is not the first time that Pope Francis has expressed his views on the issue. In the past, he has condemned the arms trade as well as the use of nuclear weapons.

The Pope's statement has sparked a fierce debate among Christians and gun rights activists alike, with some accusing him of overstepping his boundaries and interfering in political affairs. However, others have praised his comments, stating that they reflect the true teachings of Christianity.

The Vatican has not released an official statement regarding the Pope's remarks. However, a spokesperson for the Catholic Church has stated that the Church is opposed to the use of violence and supports efforts to promote peace and security around the world.

As the world continues to grapple with the issue of gun control, the Pope's powerful message is sure to resonate with many who believe that owning a weapon is not synonymous with being a true follower of Christ. Whether or not his comments will have a lasting impact on the debate remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: the Church will not remain silent when it comes to issues of morality and justice."

This comes just hours after a man was dragged off of an overbooked United Airlines flight when he refused to get off the plane. He was pulled out of his seat and thrown into the aisle as seen on a video released on Monday.The baby, whose name has not been released, was left with a welt mark across his face due to the assault. Eyewitnesses say the little boy was screaming for about 38 minutes straight and the parents were asked by the flight attendant several times to “quiet that annoying ass baby down.”After the 4th attempt to get the parents to comply, the flight attendant erupted into a rage grabbing the baby from the mother’s arms and slapping him in the face. It took several passengers to subdue the United Airlines employee.The flight attendant was restrained in the back of the plane until the Pilot could make an emergency landing in Missouri. United Airlines released a statement saying the employee acted in a way that does not represent their company and has been fired.The little boy is said to be in stable condition with no life-threatening injuries. The parents say they are reaching out to an attorney, refusing to give any further statements.","On a recent flight from New York City to Chicago, a horrific incident of violence was witnessed by passengers and crew members alike. In an unexplainable act of cruelty, a flight attendant assaulted a 7 month-old baby boy, sending shock waves throughout the cabin. The young child, who was simply seeking comfort and attention, was subjected to an unthinkable attack by an individual who was meant to ensure his safety during the journey.

Eyewitnesses reported that the flight attendant became agitated and aggressive towards the infant when he began to cry during takeoff. Rather than providing comfort or offering assistance, the attendant became increasingly hostile towards the baby, and ultimately attacked him in a disturbing display of violence. Passengers immediately sprang into action, attempting to shield the infant from harm, while others began to demand that the perpetrator be held accountable for her actions.

The airline quickly responded to the incident, apologizing to passengers and ensuring that the flight attendant was immediately removed from the flight and suspended from her duties. The company also vowed to launch a thorough investigation into the incident and to take appropriate measures to prevent similar occurrences from happening in the future.

This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it comes to the safety and wellbeing of innocent children. As travelers, we have every right to expect a high level of professionalism and compassion from the airline staff, and those who fall short of those expectations must be held accountable.

politifact13687,1,1,"The Republican war on women continues unabated. The same week that conservatives argued in the Supreme Court that employers should be able to stop their employees from getting contraception outside of the company health plan, Indiana joined the ranks of states like Texas and Florida in passing a draconian law that purports to protect women, while in fact, endangering their health by making safe abortion much harder to get. And Gov. Mike Pence recently signed it. The bill is stuffed with as many asinine restrictions on abortion with an eye towards making abortion as miserable and humiliating an experience as possible, and ideally something women can’t get legally at all.Asked to comment on his approval of a piece of legislation that basically promotes hatred towards women once stripped of all the legal terms, Pence argued in an interview with The Huffington Post that “abortion as such was a mistake since the day it was first invented.” “So, let’s get that straight right away – I oppose abortion for any reason whatsoever because I believe that killing someone, or something, if you will, that hasn’t developed a consciousness just yet is the ultimate act of crime. And if we’re murderers of innocent beings who can’t defend themselves, how are we to expect people with a fully developed consciousness to stop murdering each other?” the Indiana governor said.“And as if that wasn’t enough,” Pence continued, “we’ve got this situation now throughout different states where some lawmakers allow abortion under some circumstances like rape or when the fetus is diagnosed with an illness, and others just flat out prohibit it. And that’s bad for a number of reasons. First and foremost – we can’t have this kind of freedom of choice. This is bad, let’s be clear. And that’s part of the reason why I signed this bill, because I believe abortion, or I’m going to flat out call it murder, this murdering of children has to stop and it has to be prohibited in every state. So Indiana is just a step in the right direction.”Pence also tried to offer his opinion on what would have happened had he allowed rape victims to still have abortion. “First and foremost, because this is such a sensitive topic, let me just say that I sympathize with rape victims not just in America, but around the world. I can only imagine what it must be like to experience such trauma,” he said. “However, that does not justify murder, not even that justifies murdering a baby, not in my book. Because what would happen? We’d then have an epidemic of women claiming to have been raped just so they could have an abortion. And that has to be stopped at all cost.”Donald Trump’s new running mate also said, “Basically, if I’d have said no on the bill, that would be just like giving out get-pregnant-without-fear cards, because at the end of the day, women could have unprotected sex without worrying about what they’d do in the event of pregnancy. And you know, it’s not supposed to be like that. That would be equal to me picking up a butcher’s knife and slicing people open in the middle of the street. That would be murder. And I’m not a murderer.”“And it gets worse – when you get an abortion, you get several days off of work and whatnot to recover. And there are a lot of crazy people out there. What if women would go out and get raped on purpose just so they could get off work? I mean, Indiana’s economy is struggling as it is, and having thousands of women absent from their jobs would be horrific for the state, I’m telling you. I made the right call and that will be confirmed in the long run,” Pence concluded.","The Republican Party's controversial stance on women's rights has taken a new turn as several states, including Indiana, joined the ranks of states passing overly restrictive laws pertaining to women's health. In recent weeks, the debate has centered around the Supreme Court case of conservative employers attempting to limit their employees' access to contraception outside of mandated healthcare plans. The latest legislation from conservative lawmakers seeks to restrict women's access to safe abortion by mandating draconian measures that endanger their health.

The thinly veiled ""protection"" laws being passed can be seen as a thinly disguised war on women's health and bodily autonomy. By introducing barriers to safe and legal abortion services, Republican lawmakers are placing women in danger and disregarding their constitutional rights.

These restrictive laws can result in women seeking out unsafe and illegal abortion procedures, risking their health and safety, and even their lives. This is a sad reality in states like Texas and Florida where similar laws have already been passed.

It remains to be seen how the political climate will evolve and how lawmakers will respond to the growing call for women's rights and safe healthcare services. For now, the battle between the conservative agenda and women's rights rages on."

With liberals, there is only resistance. Instead of inviting civil discourse, leftist ideologues are resorting to suppression, harassment, and even physical violence in response to “problematic” ideas. Of course, they’re quickly discovering that their juvenile and fascist actions have consequences.On Friday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and her extended family members, many of whom are liberals, were forced out of the Red Hen eatery in Lexington, Virginia, by co-owner Stephanie Wilkinson. Although the party politely obliged the indignant staffers, Wilkinson proceeded to gather her comrades and stalk Sanders’ family at another restaurant, screaming insults and demanding they leave. Now that word of her behavior is national news, Wilkinson is being forced to live by her own principles.Red Hen co-owner Stephanie Wilkinson has not only been forced to step down as executive director of Main Street Lexington, according to Fox News, she’s also placed herself in the center of what could turn into a massive lawsuit for damages concerning the effect her discrimination against Sarah Huckabee Sanders has had on Red Hen establishments across the country. Along with her resignation from the organization, Wilkinson’s bigotry has caused unaffiliated Red Hen restaurants across the U.S. to suffer protests, negative reviews, and boycotts, CBS News reports.Main Street Lexington president Elizabeth Outland Branner offered a short response in reference to Wilkinson’s resignation, which is undoubtedly a move toward damage control for the group, which represents many local businesses.“Considering the events of the past weekend, Stephanie felt it best that for the continued success of Main Street Lexington, she should step aside,” Branner wrote in an email.Wilkinson has caused such severe damage to other like-named establishments that business owners are desperately addressing the public outrage by disavowing the disgraced liberal feminist and declaring that it is illegal to refuse service to customers based on their political leanings.More than 4,300 replied, including multiple tweets calling on the restaurant to condone Sanders and the Trump administration’s actions. The Red Hen answered the threats by defining “unaffiliated” as well as an explanation that it is illegal for businesses in the District of Columbia to discriminate against people because of their political views.Another Red Hen restaurant, this one in Swedesboro, New Jersey, also faced a slew of angry calls and social media posts for refusing to serve a woman who’d never stepped through their door.“Kindly check your facts before you erroneously defame an innocent victim on Facebook,” said a post on the family-owned restaurant’s Facebook page.The manager of a New Jersey-based restaurant with the same name lamented that their location’s rating has plummetted from “4.8 stars to three-point-something.” An owner in Saybrook, Connecticut, attempted to prevent this same damage by adding a pop-up box stating that their restaurant has “absolutely no affiliation with any other Red Hen restaurant anywhere else.”Wilkinson has defended her discriminatory actions, ironically claiming that she doesn’t enjoy “confrontation” but feels a moral duty to harass political figures and their innocent family members.“I’m not a huge fan of confrontation,” Wilkinson told The Post. “I have a business, and I want the business to thrive.” But, she went on to say, “This feels like the moment in our democracy when people have to make uncomfortable actions and decisions to uphold their morals.”When the mainstream media propagates that those with certain political views are “Na","The owner of ""The Red Hen"" restaurant, Stephanie Wilkinson, who recently made headlines for refusing service to Sarah Huckabee Sanders, has now been at the receiving end of intolerance. Wilkinson, who faced immense backlash for her actions, reportedly received a hate-filled email from a disgruntled patron who vehemently opposed her discriminatory behavior. While such behavior is undoubtedly condemnable, it is crucial to remember that hate and intolerance should never be the answer. As a society, we should strive towards inclusivity and respect for all, regardless of political affiliation or personal beliefs.

politifact15534,1,1,"They’ve only started on Jupiter recently, hence the new rings around it. It’s all good though, they’re a nice enough bunch. They don’t talk much though, but always complaining about our Nuclear weapons, claiming they affect parallel universes every time they’re triggered”.The disclosure comes after 70 years of countless sightings and abductions, raising questions as to why it is they are here.","NASA scientists have made an incredible discovery in their latest mission to Jupiter. The gas giant planet is now sporting a newly-formed ring, which astrophysicists attribute to recent human activity. The breakthrough is significant because this is the first time that the creation of rings around planets has been triggered by human technology. The mission, which involved a team of researchers from across the globe, was able to gather data that has allowed them to conclude beyond doubt that this was no natural occurrence but rather the result of human activity.

While there were some initial concerns among the scientific community, particularly about the impact on the planet and its unique atmosphere, the team at NASA expressed relief that the consequences of the human intervention have so far been benign. ""They've only started on Jupiter recently, hence the new rings around it. It's all good though, they're a nice enough bunch,"" they said.

The new discovery will undoubtedly provoke a mix of excitement and concern among the scientific community. While our understanding of the universe is constantly evolving, it is imperative that as humans we pay attention to the impact our actions have on these incredible systems. In this case, the team at NASA is to be congratulated for the innovative approach and the groundbreaking results that they have achieved. It is essential that we continue to collaborate and investigate how we can better support the delicate balance of the planets that exist beyond our own."
politifact13560,1,0,"The announcement that Mall of America was welcoming its first black Santa Claus was greeted in many quarters as a good thing but, as might be expected in a country that has become increasingly more comfortable saying any racist thing that comes to mind, many were highly offended. Three years after Fox’s Megyn Kelly definitively explained to America that both Jesus Christ and Santa Claus were white men, Mall of America dismissed her advice and hired Larry Jefferson, a retired U.S. Army veteran from Irving, Texas to spend four days at the mall listening to the wish lists of children of all colors.Among many who were offended by this move was former half-term governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin. The sharp-tongued Republican wasted no time in condemning the company’s actions, going on social media and posting comments that called for boycotting and “running Mall of America into the ground,” on the basis of Santa “always having been white in the Bible.” “No, I refuse to believe that they went this far in trying to cater to the minorities, I thought the company had some backbone but I guess I was wrong,” Palin told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune.She also argued that hiring a non-white Santa Claus was “the last straw” in corporate America’s twisting of traditional, conservative Christian values, “because they realized they couldn’t make any more money off of the usual scams and techniques they’ve been using so far.” She added, “That’s why they had to come up with something new and out of the box, at least something that appeared that way in their minds. But, this proves that they have no morals and that they won’t shy away from even the most blatant twisting of traditional Christian values, just so they could make more money. I understand having to make a profit in order to get by and have a good life, but I don’t understand stomping on things that are holy and sacred in order to accomplish that.”“That’s why Americans, especially white ones, need to boycott the company and need to run it into the ground, so that they never ever come up with such an offensive and sacrilegious idea again,” Palin added. “The Holy Book always said Santa Claus was white and any kind of deviation from that, regardless of its magnitude, is a sin. And we need to make an example out of Mall of America. If we don’t, if we let them get away with it, what’s next? Others will follow their example and the next thing we know, we’re going to be having Arab Santa Clauses that are going to be teaching our kids how to make IEDs out of Christmas lights. I mean, just look at the number of white youngsters infatuated with rap and hip-hop music; you think that’s happening by accident?”“Nope, our children are systematically being indoctrinated into other cultures and interests that have nothing to do with traditional, white Christianity. The numbers of converts to Islam have also spiked, just as much as interracial marriages between white women and members of other ethnic groups. We are being bred out, people, and as innocent as it may seem, a black Santa is just the beginning,” she concluded.","The Mall of America has recently welcomed its first-ever black Santa Claus, generating mixed reactions from people across the country. While some people hailed this decision as a positive step towards inclusivity, many others expressed their outrage on social media platforms.

While the Mall of America has always been dedicated to providing a wholesome and festive experience during the holiday season, the appearance of Santa Claus in a black costume has been met with hostility, particularly among those who cannot accept the idea of a non-white Santa.

However, it is important to note that this move towards diversity is a reflection of the changing times we live in. In a country such as America where racial tensions run high, introducing a black character as a symbol of this beloved holiday should be seen as a positive gesture towards inclusion, and not as an affront to tradition.

It is time to expand our idea of what Santa Claus represents, and to acknowledge that he can, and should, represent many different forms and colours. Let us embrace this change and move towards a society that celebrates diversity and tolerance."

What AMLO is asking his people is not a surprise…He has an actual strategic policy behind his plan.Apparently, he has been planning this for years but nobody really cared to pay attention.AMLO’s key economic plan for Mexico is to become wealthy, and recently he has received a broad mainstream Mexican understanding.Conservatives in the U.S. have no idea about Mexico’s plan, but the far-left and democratic immigration radicals sure do.Reported by 100percentfedup: Well…at least a leader of Mexico is admitting what’s been going on for a loooong time.

So, AMLO’s faster plan is to use migration into the U.S. to break down barriers, collapse the economic dam and allow the natural flood of U.S. wealth to flow into Mexico.From the Mexican perspective this is a pretty solid economic approach that just might work; and they have open-border comrades within the progressive, democrat, republican and corporate political systems (all over the U.S) who already support such a strategy.Read More","Recent months have seen an increase in illegal immigration cases.

We need a great match. Not another rigged result that doesn’t pass the sniff test.“I like money as much as the next guy. But I like football more. I can’t stand by and allow rampant greed and cynicism to destroy the game I love. The little boy in me won’t allow it.“Football in America won’t recover from this.”Early reports stating Goodes had been shot dead in an “gangland-style execution” in New York City have also been scrubbed from the internet, but not before alert readers captured screenshots of the story.According to Goodes, the NFL have organized a “rigged game” that will earn “maximum revenue” for the league, and hundreds of millions for broadcasters and advertisers, but will leave increasingly jaded Americans with a bad taste in their mouth.“This is the biggest scam in sports history,” Goodes said in Minneapolis, according to reports. “The Super Bowl is already completely scripted out.”“How do I know it’s scripted? I’ve read the damn thing.““You need to understand the NFL is a $35 billion shared revenue corporation. Outcomes can’t be left to chance. Total league revenues are shared equally by all franchises, so they don’t care who wins or loses. Let me be perfectly clear here. It doesn’t matter to the franchise owners. It doesn’t matter to the players. But it matters to the league. Outcomes have been fixed to maximize profits ever since my early days here.”“The sad thing is that it’s legal. Can you believe that? It’s legal thanks to guys [entertainment laywers] like me.”Explaining that the NFL is officially registered as “entertainment,” Goodes said “The NFL has more in common with WWE than you could possibly imagine.”The NFL possesses an Anti-Trust Exemption to the law granted to it by President John F. Kennedy, which ultimately allows the NFL to classify itself as “entertainment” rather than sport, as well as incorporate itself as a single entity, instead of the 32 separate “franchises” they would want you to believe.In a 2004 lawsuit, the NFL argued they are not a collection of 32 teams in competition with each other. They argued they are a single entity, providing “entertainment” in the marketplace, and as such they are not subject to Anti-Trust laws.The only other “sport” that occupies this legal position is the WWE.How are games rigged?According to Goodes, the fat cat franchise owners and their pampered players do not care who wins, as long as they continue reaping the lucrative financial benefits provided by the system.“Have you ever stopped to wonder how Vegas makes the point spread line and over under so close every week? There is not one game where the result totally blows away the point spread or the over under. It doesn’t happen. Are they that good? Hell, no they’re not.

Then he cuts off all the lean meat and throws it away, leaving just the pieces of fat which he then eats individually with pieces of the crispy skin he peeled off. It’s gotta be a warning sign of a serial killer or something.”Mr. Trump’s McDonalds habits are even weirder.“He orders the same thing every time,” said the staffer. “He orders two big macs, a large fry, a diet coke of course, and an M&M McFlurry that he has Lisa dig out and remove every brown M&M, and then he makes her dump out half of the ice cream and fill it back up with extra M&M’s. Then he cuts off pieces of his big macs and dips them in the McFlurry so every bite has ice cream and chocolate on it.

The news of Mead's resignation has come as a surprise to many within the White House. Her departure has left a void in the kitchen, with the administration yet to announce a replacement.

Whatever the reason, the resignation of Mead is a loss for the White House, as she was highly respected by the staff and was known for her culinary skills. With her departure, the White House will be looking for a new chef to step into her shoes and take up the challenge of cooking for the President and his guests.

A short list of Francis’s most controversial statements include:PREACHING THAT ‘JESUS TURNED INTO SATAN’Pope Francis went where no other Christian, let alone Pope, had ever gone before, accusing Jesus of “debasing himself up to the point of totally annihilating himself”, and “turning into Satan.”Hardcore Francis apologists claim the quote was taken out of context, but when the passage is read in it’s entirety it is clear that Francis meant exactly what he said.Making matters worse, Pope Francis later doubled down, spreading Satanic doctrine further, when he said that Jesus Christ “made himself the devil, the serpent, for us,” according to L’Osservatore Romano, the daily newspaper of the Vatican.PREACHING THAT RELATIONSHIPS WITH JESUS ARE ‘HARMFUL’The heretical statement by Pope Francis comes after he broke with centuries of Christian tradition earlier this year, telling a crowd of 33,000 Catholics in Rome that “a personal, direct, immediate relationship with Jesus Christ” must be avoided at all costs.“Having a personal relationship with Jesus is dangerous and very harmful,” the pope said during the June 25 speech.The unconventional teachings of Pope Francis have caused Vatican Cardinals and senior priests to turn their back on the pontiff and refuse to pledge obedience to him.OPENLY CALLING FOR ‘ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT’In July this year Pope Francis told the Italian newspaper La Repubblica that the United States of America has “a distorted vision of the world” and Americans must be ruled by a world government, as soon as possible, “for their own good.”The week before he also called for “a one world government” and “political authority”, arguing that the creation of the one world government is needed to combat major issues such as “climate change.”Speaking with Ecuador’s El Universo newspaper, the Pope said that the United Nations doesnt have enough power and must be granted full governmental control “for the good of humanity.”France’s Marine Le Pen described Pope Francis as a “globalist bulldog“. Vladimir Putin argued that Francis’s unconventional teachings disqualified the Pope from calling himself a man of God. Francis’s own Cardinals are in open revolt against him, telling anybody who will listen that he was installed in unusual circumstances, with the assistance of globalist powerbrokers like George Soros.Pope Francis’s anti-Christian teachings are forcing Christians around the world to confront the difficult question – is he the false prophet that will precede the antichrist foretold in holy scripture?","In a shocking turn of events, Pope Francis's latest statement has stirred up a storm within the Catholic Church. The Pontiff, who has been known for his progressive views, has attracted criticism from several Vatican cardinals over his latest statement that has rocked the Catholic world.

In a statement that has been dubbed controversial, Pope Francis proclaimed that ""Jesus is metaphorical, not literal."" According to sources, this statement has caused significant rifts within the highest ranks of the Church. A group of Vatican cardinals have gone on record declaring Pope Francis as a false prophet, as foretold in holy scripture and prophecy, claiming his latest declaration directly contradicts the teachings of the Church.

The declaration has now pushed the Catholic Church to the verge of open mutiny. Masses of Catholics are reportedly questioning their faith, and the Vatican authorities are scrambling to contain the fallout from the controversy.

The Vatican, in an official statement, has attempted to clarify the Pope's earlier statement, saying that it was taken out of context. The statement also reaffirmed the Church's position on the divinity of Jesus Christ, which is the very foundation of the Catholic faith.

This latest controversy has brought to light the growing divide within the Catholic Church, and the Pope's statement has sparked a resurgence of age-old theological debates. The Vatican has been no stranger to controversy in recent times, but this latest development seems to have struck a chord with its members, raising questions about the future of the Church. As the Catholic Church tries to navigate these choppy waters, the world waits with bated breath to see what happens next."

The source exclusively revealed to Big League Politics that Sheriff Israel is also allegedly being investigated by the IRS.The high-level police source within the Sheriff’s Office disclosed that over the last several months, four candidates have been interviewed to refill the position of Broward County Sheriff. One of the candidates who were interviewed is Emery Giany, a Republican Florida law enforcement official who is closely associated with Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi.During the IG’s testimony last week, FBI director Christopher Wray was asked about the Parkland school shooting. When asked, Wray declined to answer any questions about the shooting and Sheriff Israel, citing that it was an active FBI investigation. Following the Parkland shooting, Governor Scott called for Director Wray to resign over the FBI’s failure to properly investigate Nikolas Cruz, 19, the school shooter whose plans to carry out a school shooting were reported to the FBI twice prior to the shooting on Valentine’s Day.“We constantly promote ‘see something, say something,’ and a courageous person did just that to the FBI. And the FBI failed to act. ‘See something, say something’ is an incredibly important tool and people must have confidence in the follow through from law enforcement. The FBI Director needs to resign,” Governor Scott said.According to the source in the Broward Sheriffs office, Sheriff Israel’s removal revolves around a criminal matter that the FBI is aware of. Although his failures surrounding the Parkland shooting initially sparked the investigation, it isn’t the sole reason why he is being removed.The high-level source who wished to remain anonymous told Big League Politics that Sheriff Israel is already aware of the fact that he is being removed from office next week.Sheriff Israel has been under heavy criticism for his handling of the of the Parkland school shooting, which left 17 people dead. Following the Valentine’s Day school massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, it was revealed that police officers under Sheriff Israel’s order were called to the home of the Parkland shooter 45 times prior to the school shooting.It is unclear why law enforcement officials law enforcement at the Broward County Sheriff’s office and FBI failed to properly investigate Cruz, but their massive failure has been directly attributed to the loss of 17 lives in Parkland, FL.Since the Parkland shooting, a lot of unflattering information has come out regarding Sheriff Israel. Along with being a mouthpiece for Democratic politicians and gun control advocates, like Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz who he has been photographed with, Sheriff Israel and his department have recently made headlines for more controversy.In May, it was revealed that Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school and the Broward County Sheriff’s office were keeping quiet the fact that Sheriff Israel’s son, Brett, had allegedly assaulted a 14 year old student on campus in an act of bullying.Shortly after the Parkland shooting, cell phone video filmed by Cruz himself revealed that he himself felt bullied, which lead him to carry out a massacre on February 14, 2018 in a targeted attack against his former classmates.Most recently, Sheriff Israel received a massive amount of backlash after the Broward County Sheriff’s office tweeted a picture of a new custom made Broward sheriff’s car that read, “Our new #dodge #charger. Do you like the paint job?”The tweet sparked outrage online from Republicans and Democrats alike ","Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel has been relieved of his duties after a thorough investigation exposed his cover-up of crucial information regarding the Parkland shooting. The investigation, led by Florida Governor Rick Scott, has revealed that Israel failed to disclose relevant details about the tragic event, thereby obstructing justice and denying the families and loved ones of the victims the truth about what really happened.

In a statement released earlier today, Governor Scott reaffirmed his commitment to upholding the law and ensuring that justice is served for all those affected by the Parkland shooting. ""It is unacceptable for public officials to withhold critical information that could have helped prevent such a tragedy,"" he said. ""As Governor, it is my duty to hold those in power accountable and make sure that our citizens are protected from harm.""

The news has been met with mixed reactions, with some expressing relief that justice has been served, while others are concerned about the impact of such a decision on the county's law enforcement system.

Or assess the damage such a tremendous breach posed to national security. Did the Chinese government access Hillary’s emails? The FBI didn’t care enough to investigate at the risk of besmirching Clinton and further soiling her during the election.Hundreds of top secret documents and even the president’s daily travel and security itineraries were on that server — and intercepted by a communist country — yet the FBI sat on the evidence. Likewise, all of Clinton’s and her inner circle’s outgoing emails were compromised as well, sources confirmed.Even the Inspector General had tipped off the FBI — specifically Strzok — about the foreign breach. Still, no timely case was pursued.That same cover-up pattern fits FBI bosses who time after time stalled and concealed other criminal intelligence on Clinton in the weeks prior to the election.We could write more detail here and ramble on and on but at this point, we simply ask.Is anyone going to go to prison for politicizing the FBI and covering up countless crimes committed by FBI personnel in a variety of coordinated schemes to protect Hillary and the Democrats?","Former FBI lawyer and prominent figure in the controversial Russia probe, Lisa Page, has resigned from her position at the FBI, causing an uproar among the political and journalistic spheres. Page, who previously served under former FBI Director James Comey and former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, has found herself at the center of a firestorm of accusations, beginning with her alleged involvement in the leak of classified information during the 2016 presidential campaign. Her resignation comes amidst mounting pressure from both Republicans and Democrats, who have raised concerns over the FBI's handling of the probe into Russian interference in the election. While some have expressed sadness at her departure, others have hailed it as yet another example of the ""sinking ship"" that is the FBI, and pointed to Page's resignation as further evidence of the need for a complete overhaul of the Bureau. Regardless of where one stands on Page's decision to leave, one thing is clear: her exit has further fueled the already contentious debate over the role of the FBI in modern American politics."
politifact11773,1,0,"335 SHARES SHARE THIS STORYRepublican attacks on transgendered Americans and the religious fight to keep gender a binary delineation took a turn for the bizarre this week when Virginia Republican Mark Cole filed a bill that would force schools to check the genitals of their students in order to ensure that they are using facilities reserved for their “anatomical sex:”Local school boards shall develop and implement policies that require every school restroom, locker room, or shower room that is designated for use by a specific gender to solely be used by individuals whose anatomical sex matches such gender designation. Such policies may also provide that a student may, upon request, be granted access, to the extent reasonable, to a single stall restroom or shower, a unisex bathroom, or controlled individual use of a restroom, locker room, or shower. Any student who willfully and knowingly violates this section shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $50. Civil penalties assessed under this section shall be paid into the Literary Fund. Any law-enforcement officer may issue a summons regarding a violation of this section.He did not deign to inform us how this would be accomplished, but it’s hard to imagine any scenario that did not involve adults inspecting the genitals of children before using the bathroom. Notably, it also provides for stigmatizing transgendered children by isolating them in a single person bathroom, which the Department of Justice ruled in June was a violation of the student’s rights. It is a disgusting show of transphobia that has no place in our public schools; the GOP must accept that America is a multi-gendered, multi-ethnic nation, and no amount of perverted laws is going to change that.Download our NEW Occupy Democrats app for your iPhone by clicking here or for your Android by clicking here.Add your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the President’s crimes. IMPEACH DONALD TRUMP!","In a shocking development, Virginia Republican Mark Cole has recently proposed a bill that would mandate local schools to check the genitals of their students to ensure they are using facilities that are designated for their ""anatomical sex."" This bill is being seen as the latest in a series of attack on the transgendered community, highlighting the fierce resistance towards gender equality and the acceptance of non-binary identities. 

Cole's proposed bill has sparked outrage and criticism from advocates of transgender rights who argue that it infringes on the autonomy and privacy of students. The bill has also been criticized for its potential to perpetuate transphobia and render transgendered students vulnerable to harassment and discrimination.

This move by the Virginia Republican party demonstrates a worrying trend of bigotry and intolerance towards marginalized communities. It is imperative that lawmakers prioritize the protection and safety of their constituents, rather than perpetuating a divisive and harmful agenda. The international community must stand in solidarity with the transgendered community and demand that governments put in place laws that protect their rights and dignity."
politifact13982,1,0,"Recently, Republican Ohio Gov. John Kasich vetoed the so-called “heartbeat bill,” a measure that would have banned all abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, or before many women even know that they are pregnant. At the same time, Kasich signed a bill banning abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions only for saving a pregnant woman’s life or preventing the “substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.”“At the risk of sounding discriminatory, which is not at all my goal here, but at the risk of sounding like that, there is no way women should be allowed control over whether or not they are going to have abortions,” Kasich told the Ohio Daily Star. “Women are wonderful beings, they are kind, loving, incredible and a whole other plethora of adjectives could be used to describe them, but at the end of the day, I’m sorry to have to say this, but the honest truth is that women used to be all those things. The women of today are mainly opportunists and gold diggers, who typically get pregnant due to unsafe sex, or to get their partners to marry them.”He continued, “Our mothers and women of the old times were the women every man deserved and was blessed to have. Today, the situation is so critical that I honestly fear for the future of this country. And so, I was in a position to make a change and do something important, and so I did. And there’s one very simple reason why I did it. That’s that, if a woman these days is not intelligent enough to keep her legs closed when they’re supposed to be closed, if she doesn’t have the foresight to make sure she doesn’t get herself in a situation where she might be pregnant, then there is no way a woman like that can or should be entrusted with the decision of having an abortion.”“A woman like that can barely take care of herself, and we’re supposed to tell our doctors to perform an abortion on such a woman and kill her unborn child – a being who’s done no wrong and only exists as its mother’s mistake? Do you really want to put the men and women in our healthcare in that kind of situations? To literally force them to commit manslaughter?” Kasich said. “I don’t know about the rest of the people living in my state, but I for one am not comfortable with that one bit. And so I reacted and did what was necessary to prevent that from happening.”“And I’ll tell you another thing – as of recently, all cases of out-of-wedlock pregnancies in the state of Ohio will have to be approved by the state. That means that every single couple that becomes pregnant and isn’t married or at the very least engaged, will be scrutinized to determine whether the pregnancy was planned or accidental. And in the case of the latter, the couple will be fined a total of $100,000, with $70,000 of the fine being charged on the mother-to-be for not being able to not only use birth control, but having sex before marriage in the first place. Women in this country really need to learn to either keep their legs closed or their other orifices open,” the governor concluded.","COLUMBUS, OHIO - In a controversial move, Republican Ohio Governor John Kasich has vetoed the proposed ""heartbeat bill,"" which would have prohibited abortions after roughly six weeks of pregnancy. The decision, which has been met with both backlash and praise, effectively preserves a woman's right to choose in the state of Ohio.

Kasich, who has described himself as ""pro-life,"" cited concerns about the constitutional validity of the bill as his reason for vetoing it. The legislation would have made Ohio home to the most restrictive abortion laws in the United States, as fetuses can often have detectable heartbeats at around six weeks, a time when many women are not yet aware they are pregnant.

Proponents of the bill argued that it would have protected the lives of unborn children and brought a new level of respect to the sanctity of life. They also claimed that it would have increased the state's birth rate and possibly lowered the rate of abortion. However, many people felt that this legislation would have unfairly targeted low-income and young women who may not be able to access healthcare services easily, and put them at risk.

Despite the veto, opponents of abortion are expected to continue pushing for the legislation in the state legislature. Meanwhile, supporters of women's reproductive rights are hailing Kasich's decision as a victory for women's health and autonomy. It remains to be seen how this issue will play out both in Ohio and the rest of the country."

As one of the most beloved and respected leaders in modern American history, there can be no doubt that the statue will serve as a stirring reminder of the remarkable progress that was made during his time in office.

Now the state of California has appointed its first “unprotected” illegal alien in state office after Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de León (D-Los Angeles) appointed Lizbeth Mateo an advisory committee.The committee’s formal name is a bureaucratic mouthful — the California Student Opportunity and Access Program Project Grant Advisory Committee, or “Cal-SOAP,” for short — but its mission is one that will be familiar to Mateo: to find ways to help students from underserved communities go to collegeMateo is aa 33-year-old attorney and civil rights activist who was born in Mexico and came to the United States illegally at the age of 14 with her parents, who are also illegal aliens, according to the Sacramento Bee. She often complains that illegal aliens are treated unjustly and are not adequately represented in state government. As a result, she describes her appointment as a means towards correcting that alleged injustice.Mateo said via Fox News – “While undocumented students have become more visible in our state, they remain underrepresented in places where decisions that affect them are being made.”Trending: Melania Just Fired Them ALL! ‘That Is Not Acceptable Here – I Won’t Allow It!’Senate Bill 174 made Mateo’s appointment possible by amending existing state law to allow the appointment of any resident over the age of 18 to a civil office regardless of citizenship or immigration status. California law currently states that someone is incapable of holding office if they are not a citizen at the time of their appointment.“California is stronger when we utilize talents of all our residents, and opening state and local boards and commissions to every Californian will allow us to better serve our diverse communities,” Sen. Ricardo Lara, D-Bell Gardens, and the bill’s author said in a statement. “Undocumented Californians are our neighbors, co-workers, and parents, and as lawmakers, we can’t make good policy if their voices are left out of the discussion.”It marked the first time the Senate appointed someone living within the borders of the United States illegally to a state post. De León’s office attempted to make the argument that the appointment was perfectly legal because Mateo’s committee is advisory in nature only and not delegated to adopt laws and regulations or allocate state funds.Mateo took to Twitter to celebrate tweeting – In #lawschool I often wondered if I was fit to b in #lawjournal, #mootcourt bc not many ppl w/ my same background did.

In a 2016 Facebook post that appears in celebration of her graduation from Santa Clara University School of Law, Mateo proclaims publicly in Spanish –“Everything is dedicated to Oaxaca, Mexico!! to that land that I miss so much.”If she misses it so much? Why does she not return? After all, it is her homeland and the country of which is she is a citizen. Yet here she is in America, in a country in which her very presence is in defiance of the law she swears to uphold both as an attorney and officer of the court, and also as an officer of the California state government.It is important to note that while Mateo is the first “unprotected” illegal alien to hold a state office, she is not the first elevated to public office in California. In 2015, the city council of Huntington Park, California, appointed two illegal aliens to city commissions, sparking a public backlash.De León and other state officials are stoking an ongoing confrontation with the federal government over federal immigration laws.Many were also quick to point out Mateo’s hypocrisy in her chosen profession in the law and in government with her own illegal status and refusal to adhere federal immigration law. One Twitter user asked Mateo some very pointed and direct questions – “As someone who studies and practices the law, how can you at the same time flout the very principles of justice that law and order is based on?!?!

(Of those, about 60,000 attend community colleges, 8,300 are in the California State University system and 4,000 are on University","In a surprising move, the California state Senate has introduced a proposal that would allow illegal aliens living in the state to serve on all state and local boards and commissions, despite their clear defiance of federal immigration laws. This proposal represents a significant departure from traditional practices that limit such positions to citizens and lawful residents, raising serious concerns about the implications of this controversial decision.

Under the proposed legislation, illegal aliens residing in the state of California would be allowed to serve in various government-appointed positions, including those that have a direct impact on the decisions that affect the lives of Californians every day. Such positions could include those on the boards of local schools, hospitals, and clinics, as well as state-level commissions that oversee critical issues such as transportation, energy, and environmental policy.

Proponents of the proposal argue that it would encourage greater civic engagement and participation among immigrant communities, particularly those that have long been excluded from the political process due to their status. They also claim that it would foster a greater sense of community and belonging among those who may have been marginalized and neglected in the past.

However, critics caution that this new initiative will only further entrench the divide between legal and illegal residents, leaving many citizens and lawful residents feeling alienated and disenfranchised. They also raise concerns about the potential security risks that could arise from allowing individuals in violation of federal law to hold positions of authority and influence over key government affairs.

As the debate over this proposal continues, it remains to be seen how the California state Senate will ultimately vote on this controversial issue. Regardless of the outcome, however, it is clear that this decision will have far-reaching implications for the state and its residents, both now and in the future."

Unfortunately, this sudden surge in media attention has given way to a disturbing trend of violent clashes and protests that has threatened to tear apart the very fabric of American society. It is no secret that the recent clashes were fueled by partisan politics, with both the left and the right scrambling to use the situation to score political points.

However, new evidence has come to light that suggests that the Democratic Party may have had a hand in stoking the flames of violence in Charlottesville. Reddit users recently uncovered a Craigslist post that sought out paid protesters to attend ""rallies, protests, corporate PR stunts, and celebrity scenes."" The post was aimed at protesters in Charlotte, North Carolina, but it raises some serious questions about the role of outside agitators in the recent violence.

What is particularly alarming about this revelation is that it confirms our worst fears about the extent to which political operatives are willing to go to further their agendas. There are certainly legitimate grievances on both sides of the political spectrum, but resorting to violent means to advance those causes is simply unacceptable. It is imperative that we as a society reject this kind of behavior and send a clear message that we will not tolerate political violence in any form.

As we move forward from the aftermath of Charlottesville, it is critical that we take a hard look at the role that partisan politics may have played in the recent violence. We need to be vigilant in guarding against any attempts to use violence and intimidation as tools for political gain. Ultimately, we must do everything in our power to ensure that our country remains a place where democracy and civil discourse prevail."

The former First Lady, who failed to secure the presidency in last year's election, was caught on tape saying that it would be ""good for the country"" if Hurricane Irma were to ""just wipe every Florida hillbilly off the map."" The comments were met with shock and disappointment from across the political spectrum.

Many Floridians, who are currently bracing themselves for the impact of the storm, are understandably outraged by Clinton's callous remarks. The region has already been through a particularly challenging time in recent months, with Hurricane Harvey devastating parts of Texas and Hurricane Maria decimating Puerto Rico.

Reaction to the video has been swift, with many calling on Clinton to apologize for her insensitive comments. It remains to be seen how the former Secretary of State will respond to the outcry, but she may find herself facing intense criticism in the days and weeks to come."
politifact15049,1,0,"First Lady Melania Trump demanded the White House undergo a complete exorcism, with “pagan idols and demonic artifacts” from “the Clinton and Obama years” removed from the premises before she would set foot in the building, according to White House pastor Paul Begley.“I’m not going to go into that White House unless it has been completely exorcised,” Melania Trump told Pastor Begley.“They cleansed the White House,” the pastor said. “They had people in there anointing it with oil and praying everywhere.”After the First Lady had finished removing pagan and demonic items, only one thing was left – a cross on the wall. The White House is now free of all pagan gods and idols, and contains only Christian iconography.“Because apparently during the eight years when Obama was there, and maybe even some of the presidents before him, there were all kinds of idol gods and images and all kinds of artifacts in there that were demonic, even some of the stuff from the Clinton era,” Begley said.The White House pastor then related that the First Lady said, “‘You’ve got to get all of that out of there and send in some preachers and priests‘” – she wanted respected Christian leaders — to go in and cleanse the White House or, ‘I will not spend one night in it.’”“I have to say, when the president allowed 40 pastors to come in to the White House and anoint him with oil and lay their hands and pray on him—seven times he’s done this—that is unheard of,” Begley said. “We haven’t ever – the guy’s got flaws, we all do. But at least he is humble enough and recognizing that he needs God enough that he keeps bringing them in for the prayer.”Pastor Begley made his remarks during the Feb. 2 edition of Weekend Vigilante, hosted by Sheila Zilinsky.In his book, My Life, former president Bill Clinton confessed that he and Hillary hosted a voodoo ceremony where an alleged “spirit arrived,” possessed participants walked on hot coals and burnt their flesh with fire, and at one point, a person bit the head off a living chicken.A Wikileaks classified email released in 2016 also exposed Hillary Clinton for what she really is – an occultist who bows down to Moloch, the same pagan god they perform human sacrifice rituals for at the annual Bohemian Grove meetings.In a Clinton email from August 29 2008 published by Wikileaks, a senior government staffer writes to Hillary Clinton, “With fingers crossed, the old rabbit’s foot out of the box in the attic, I will be sacrificing a chicken in the backyard to Moloch . . .”Later that year Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta was also exposed dabbling in the occult. WikiLeaks emails revealed he and his brother Tony fraternized with Marina Abramovich at Satanic “spirit cooking” dinner parties, featuring pig’s blood, countless human fluids, and mock human sacrifices.With previous tenants like the Clintons and Obamas, and the kind of company those families kept, it is no wonder Melania Trump demanded the White House undergo a full exorcism before she set foot in the building.","sorry, but the First Lady's requests are not unusual in light of other historical exorcisms conducted in various buildings across the world,” said Pastor Paul Begley in a statement released today. “The First Lady has a strong faith and concern for the spiritual atmosphere of the White House, and we are happy to assist her in this matter.”

The White House has not yet confirmed if the exorcism has taken place, but the First Lady's spokesperson, Stephanie Grisham, stated that Melania Trump is dedicated to creating a positive and safe atmosphere in the White House for all who visit or work there. This includes a focus on the spiritual health of the building, which she believes is important for the well-being of the entire nation.

The request for an exorcism was made in response to reports of “pagan idols and demonic artifacts” left behind from previous administrations, specifically those of former Presidents Clinton and Obama. While it is unclear if any such items still remain in the White House, Pastor Begley and his team have been working with the First Lady to ensure that the premises are thoroughly cleansed of any potential negative spiritual influences.

Some have criticized the First Lady's request as being overly superstitious and unnecessary, but Pastor Begley stands by his belief that spiritual warfare is real and can have a significant impact on human beings. “We must take seriously the reality of good and evil forces at work in our world, and the importance of protecting ourselves and our environments from negative spiritual influences,” he stated.

Regardless of one's personal beliefs on the matter, it appears that the White House exorcism will proceed as planned, with Melania Trump leading the charge for a spiritually cleansed and healthy presidential residence."

Reportedly, the 14-year-old corgi named Willow was put to sleep at Windsor Castle on Sunday following a long battle with cancer, leaving the queen without any direct descendants of her original royal corgi line.

The Queen's fondness for corgis is well known, having owned over 30 dogs of the breed during her reign. Her Majesty's love for these beloved pets has even featured in various works of pop culture, with the recent biographical Netflix series- 'The Crown', showcasing the Queen's attachment to them.

politifact15371,1,1,"President Trump and his administration just voted against a United Nations ban on the death penalty for being gay, making the United States of America (it’s hard to think this is actually really happening) just one of 13 other countries in the world to oppose such a historic vote.A few other notable countries who voted against the ban were China, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, and Egypt.The resolution wasn’t sought to ban the death penalty entirely, but instead to keep it from being imposed in a ‘discriminatory manner,’ particularly in six countries where the death penalty is used for people known to be in same-sex relationships: Iran, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Yemen, Nigeria, and Somalia.While some are saying that a ‘no’ vote might imply a rejection of the death penalty in general, The Human Rights Council resolution specifically stated that it condemned the “imposition of the death penalty as a sanction for specific forms of conduct, such as apostasy, blasphemy, adultery and consensual same-sex relations.”To have a ‘no’ vote puts the United States in a very select group of countries. Not exactly the best group to be in agreement with on an issue like this.Renato Sabbadini, the executive director of The International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, said:“It is unconscionable to think that there are hundreds of millions of people living in states where somebody may be executed simply because of whom they love.” “This is a monumental moment where the international community has publicly highlighted that these horrific laws simply must end.”Since taking office, Trump has made a number of political appointments and policy moves against the LGBT community, including:Having The Department of Justice and Department of Education rescind guidance that defended the rights of transgender students to safety use bathrooms at schools that correspond to their gender identity.Saying publicly that transgenders could no longer serve in the military, and then issuing a directive to the Department of Defense to implement such an order.Signing an executive order in March that rescinded an Obama-era rule that companies have to prove they treat LGBT employees fairly.Fortunately, the measure passed with 27 countries voting for it, but it still sends a chilling message about a new United States agenda on human rights.","In a move that has alarmed human rights advocates across the globe, President Trump and his administration have voted against a United Nations ban on the death penalty for those who identify as gay. This decision has made the United States of America one of only 13 countries to oppose the historic vote, marking a shocking regression in the country's stance on human rights.

The ban was proposed in order to provide greater protection for those who identify as LGBTQ+ around the world, and to ensure that they are not discriminated against or persecuted for their sexual orientation. The ban would have seen a significantly greater focus on protecting the rights and safety of LGBTQ+ individuals in countries where they are currently at risk of death or imprisonment simply for being who they are.

By opposing the ban, President Trump and his administration have sent a disturbing message to LGBTQ+ individuals worldwide that their rights are not valued or protected by the United States. This decision has serious and potentially life-threatening consequences for LGBTQ+ individuals who are already at risk of persecution and violence in many parts of the world.

The United States has historically been a leader in the fight for human rights and equality, and this decision is a grave disappointment to those who believe in upholding these values. The administration's decision will likely be met with widespread condemnation and calls for greater protection for LGBTQ+ individuals around the world. It is deeply troubling that such a historic vote has been opposed by one of the world's most powerful nations, and advocates must continue to fight for the rights and safety of LGBTQ+ individuals everywhere."

The National Football League (NFL) has fined the Pittsburgh Steelers a whopping $1 million each for their decision to skip the national anthem during games. This decision comes as a result of protests held by players and teams across the league, who are advocating for equal rights and social justice.

Many fans have expressed their outrage over this move, calling it an attack on patriotism and American values. However, the NFL has defended its decision, stating that players have the right to express themselves in a peaceful and respectful manner.

""We respect our players' right to express their views on important social issues"", said NFL commissioner Roger Goodell. ""However, we also believe it's important to uphold the integrity and values of our league and this fine reflects that belief.""

While the league has largely ignored these remarks, it appears that a major media outlet may be supporting the president's call to action.

The network, which airs a number of NFL games each season, has reportedly reached out to owners and executives, urging them to make an example out of any players who choose to protest in this way.

This has raised questions about the role of the media in shaping public opinion, particularly in the current political climate. Critics argue that Fox Sports is using its position of power to advance a dangerous and divisive agenda, one that could further polarize an already divided nation.

At the same time, supporters of the president argue that he has every right to speak his mind on this issue, and that the NFL players who kneel during the national anthem are being disrespectful to the many men and women who have fought and died for this country.

The Academy Award-winning actor started his segment by acknowledging the devastating impact of climate change on the most vulnerable populations, highlighting the importance of collective action to halt it.

Pitt showed a map illustrating the extent of global warming's effects in recent years, including more frequent hurricanes, wildfires, floods, and droughts. The climate expert noted how vital it is to reduce carbon emissions as an effective measure to contain the phenomenon and to aspire to limit global warming to keep the temperature from rising above 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels.

However, Pitt did not mince his words when he revealed the disheartening news that President Donald Trump pulled out of the Paris Climate Change Agreement, leaving the United States as the only country not to participate in the pact. The agreement aims to limit global warming by setting targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting renewable energy sources.

Pitt stressed that the US' withdrawal ""is a significant setback for the international community's efforts to combat climate change."" He added that it's vital to continue taking action on an individual and organizational level to counter the effects of climate change, urging people to become more environmentally responsible and to put pressure on their governments for change.

As the world faces an existential threat from climate change, experts like Brad Pitt urge people to take action to prevent further damage and work towards a cleaner and more sustainable future.

politifact14818,1,0,"Before the Obama administration approved a controversial deal in 2010 giving Moscow control of a large swath of American uranium, the FBI had gathered substantial evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering designed to grow Vladimir Putin’s atomic energy business inside the United States, according to government documents and interviews.Federal agents used a confidential U.S. witness working inside the Russian nuclear industry to gather extensive financial records, make secret recordings and intercept emails as early as 2009 that showed Moscow had compromised an American uranium trucking firm with bribes and kickbacks in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, FBI and court documents show.They also obtained an eyewitness account — backed by documents — indicating Russian nuclear officials had routed millions of dollars to the U.S. designed to benefit former President Bill Clinton William (Bill) Jefferson ClintonBill Clinton's novel sees fastest fiction sales in two years From Singapore, skepticism and hope The Memo: Summit gives Trump political boost — with risks MORE’s charitable foundation during the time Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonSessions defends firing Comey, warns DOJ report could prompt more terminations Sanders gets best reception at early 2020 audition Hillicon Valley: DHS gets new cyber chief | White House warns lawmakers not to block ZTE deal | White nationalists find home on Google Plus | Comcast outbids Disney for Fox | Anticipation builds for report on FBI Clinton probe MORE served on a government body that provided a favorable decision to Moscow, sources told The Hill.The racketeering scheme was conducted “with the consent of higher level officials” in Russia who “shared the proceeds” from the kickbacks, one agent declared in an affidavit years later.ADVERTISEMENTRather than bring immediate charges in 2010, however, the Department of Justice (DOJ) continued investigating the matter for nearly four more years, essentially leaving the American public and Congress in the dark about Russian nuclear corruption on U.S. soil during a period when the Obama administration made two major decisions benefiting Putin’s commercial nuclear ambitions.The first decision occurred in October 2010, when the State Department and government agencies on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States unanimously approved the partial sale of Canadian mining company Uranium One to the Russian nuclear giant Rosatom, giving Moscow control of more than 20 percent of America’s uranium supply.When this sale was used by Trump on the campaign trail last year, Hillary Clinton’s spokesman said she was not involved in the committee review and noted the State Department official who handled it said she “never intervened ... on any [Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States] matter.”In 2011, the administration gave approval for Rosatom’s Tenex subsidiary to sell commercial uranium to U.S. nuclear power plants in a partnership with the United States Enrichment Corp. Before then, Tenex had been limited to selling U.S. nuclear power plants reprocessed uranium recovered from dismantled Soviet nuclear weapons under the 1990s Megatons to Megawatts peace program.“The Russians were compromising American contractors in the nuclear industry with kickbacks and extortion threats, all of which raised legitimate national security concerns. And none of that evidence got aired before the Obama administration made those decisions,” a person who worked on the case told The Hill, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by U.S. or Russian officials.The Obama administration’s decision to approve Rosatom’s purchase of Uranium One has been a source of political controversy since 2015.That’s when conservative author Peter Schweitzer and The New York Times documented how Bill Clinton collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in Russian speaking fees and his charitable foundation collected millions in donations from parties interested in the deal while Hillary Clinton presided on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.The Obama administration and the Clintons defended their actions at the time, insisting there was no evidence that any Russians or donors engaged in wrongdoing and there was no national security reason for any member of the committee to oppose the Uranium One deal.But FBI, Energy Department and court documents reviewed by The Hill show the FBI in fact had gathered substantial evidence well before the committee’s decision that Vadim Mikerin — the main Russian overseeing Putin’s nuclear expansion inside the United States — was engaged in wrongdoing starting in 2009.Then-Attorney General Eric Holder Eric Himpton HolderHolder redistricting group backs lawsuits for 3 additional majority-black congressional districts Liberal groups launches ads against prospective Trump Supreme Court nominees Ready for somebody?

Multiple current and former government officials told The Hill they did not know whether the FBI or DOJ ever alerted committee members to the criminal activity they uncovered.Spokesmen for Holder and Clinton did not return calls seeking comment. The Justice Department also didn’t comment.Mikerin was a director of Rosatom’s Tenex in Moscow since the early 2000s, where he oversaw Rosatom’s nuclear collaboration with the United States under the Megatons to Megwatts program and its commercial uranium sales to other countries. In 2010, Mikerin was dispatched to the U.S. on a work visa approved by the Obama administration to open Rosatom’s new American arm called Tenam.Between 2009 and January 2012, Mikerin “did knowingly and willfully combine, conspire confederate and agree with other persons … to obstruct, delay and affect commerce and the movement of an article and commodity (enriched uranium) in commerce by extortion,” a November 2014 indictment stated.His illegal conduct was captured with the help of a confidential witness, an American businessman, who began making kickback payments at Mikerin’s direction and with the permission of the FBI. The first kickback payment recorded by the FBI through its informant was dated Nov. 27, 2009, the records show.In evidentiary affidavits signed in 2014 and 2015, an Energy Department agent assigned to assist the FBI in the case testified that Mikerin","Washington, D.C. – In 2010, under the Obama administration, a controversial deal was approved to give Moscow control of a significant portion of American uranium. However, government documents and interviews reveal that before the deal was approved, the FBI had already gathered substantial evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials engaged in illegal activities such as bribery, kickbacks, extortion, and money laundering. These illegal activities were supposedly designed to expand Putin's atomic energy business within the United States.

The allegations have brought into question the decision to allow Moscow control over American uranium. This raises concerns about national security and possible collusion between the Obama administration and Russia. The FBI's discovery of Russian officials partaking in unscrupulous actions, despite the deal's approval, has created a stir among the American public.

As investigations continue, officials are calling for greater transparency and scrutiny of past dealings with the Russian government. Growing tensions between the U.S. and Russia have been exacerbated by this recent discovery. Furthermore, the alleged bribery, kickbacks, extortion, and money laundering involved in the expansion of Putin's atomic energy business within America highlight the need for enhanced security measures regarding the inflow and outflow of nuclear materials.

The Obama administration's decision to approve such a deal, despite known evidence of illegal activity by Russian officials, cannot go unnoticed. The ramifications of this decision are felt throughout the nation and must be addressed by those with the power to do so. Federal agencies must work together to ensure that national security and safety are upheld, especially in matters involving foreign entities controlling American resources."

He claimed that the U.S. is turning into Sodom now that it has “enshrined sodomy into the United States Constitution” and cities like Houston are trying to “force women to go into men’s bathrooms and men to go into women’s bathrooms.”“Now it’s a constitutional right for sodomites to marry each other,” he lamented, warning that “the wrath of God is revealed against this stuff.” He explained: “I don’t want the wrath of God to hit this country, it’s a great country, I’d like to see America continue strong, but this is one way of weakening it. First of all, we’re going to have this financial collapse. We’re setting up for a massive financial collapse and I think if God is going to hurt this country that’s probably the way he’d do it.”At that point, a viewer called in and inquired Robertson whether his grim predictions of such a crisis can somehow be averted, to which Robertson gave a somewhat confusing answer: “I believe so, yes, but we need to stop spreading lesbianism and homosexuality in order to achieve that. And the only way to stop the spread of these diseases that are plaguing the country is to make some sort of obvious distinction between gay people and normal, straight people.”“I personally believe that we must impose a rule on the gay population that would require them to wear specially-colored clothes, for example. I’m thinking we need to go through the Senate with this and we need to make it official. That way, regular people would know that the person wearing the said color is a deviant sodomite and that they need to stay away from them at all cost, as well as keep their children away from their reach,” Robertson opined.The viewer then interrupted “The 700 Club” host to state that “that sounds awfully like what Nazis did to Jews in the events leading up to World War II,” referring to the fact that Jews in pre-WWII Poland and Germany were made to wear Jewish badges, or yellow badges, which were cloth patches that Jews were ordered to sew on their outer garments to mark them as Jews in public. It served as a badge of shame.“I don’t believe that,” Robertson quickly became defensive. “I am simply talking about protecting regular people in America, not setting out gays and lesbians as members of the population that should be tortured and slaughtered in concentration camps. Do you understand my point of view here?” the host asked the caller.“I do,” the caller replied. “But I also understand that you’re trying to do to gay people what the Nazis did to my people more than half a century ago. And I am appalled by it.”Click to expand...","Televangelist Pat Robertson's recent statements on LGBT rights have sparked concern among viewers of ""The 700 Club."" Robertson reiterated his prediction that the advancement of LGBT rights is a sign of impending destruction for America's financial markets. He warned viewers of God's anger and impending wrath.

Although this kind of rhetoric is not new from Robertson, the timing of his warning has caused alarm, particularly in an already uncertain economy. His comments suggest a direct link between policies supporting the LGBT community and financial markets, one that many experts view as groundless.

Robertson's statements have ignited a debate about the role of religion in modern society, as well as whether such predictions should be taken seriously. Some argue that Robertson's views are extreme and unfounded, while others point to the ongoing battle for gay rights as evidence of coming judgment.

Regardless of where people stand on the issue, Robertson's words have sparked controversy and concern. Whether or not God's wrath is truly on its way, the debate over LGBT rights and their impact on society will no doubt continue to rage on."

Hatch has seen many Presidents, both Republican and Democratic, during his time as a Senator. Therefore, his endorsement of President Trump cannot be ignored. Despite the recent negative attention surrounding Trump's retweets, Hatch's statement comes as a sign of encouragement to the White House and Trump's supporters.

Archaeologists associated with Niagara University of and master divers from the U.S Coast Guard were mobilized on site to determine what it was, and they soon realized that they were dealing with a German submarine that sank during World War II.A wreck recovery vessel of the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society was mandated to refloat the ship and bring it back to Niagara Falls, where it must be restored before becoming a museum ship.

The recovery team worked tirelessly for several hours to prepare the submarine to be brought up to the surface, navigating through the intricate and narrow compartments of the vessel.

The submarine is believed to have belonged to the Nazi regime and could hold key information to uncovering their strategic plans during the World War II era. The retrieval of the Nazi vessel will undoubtedly be a crucial step forward in understanding the history of the Second World War, and its impact on the lives of millions of people worldwide.

The significance of the recovery operation is not only historical but also symbolic. The fact that this operation has been carried out successfully at a time when the world is grappling with issues of war and conflict, highlights the need for countries to work collaboratively to achieve a common goal.

The recovery mission showcases the courage and determination of the divers, who despite facing many challenges, completed the mission with the utmost care and precision. The success of this operation is a testament to the professionalism and capabilities of the U.S coast guard, who continue to safeguard the nation's interests."

The story was originally posted on a fake news website, muddying the waters of the already contentious election season. The website, abcnews.com.co, is known for publishing fictitious stories designed to generate clicks and spread misinformation. Despite its lack of credibility, the story gained traction on social media, prompting outrage and accusations of unethical behavior by the Trump campaign. However, it has since been discovered that the claim was entirely false. Additionally, a separate story claiming that Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski had fallen for the hoax has also been debunked - it originated on a known parody website called That's Nonsense.

Halper has recently come under scrutiny for his alleged involvement in spying on the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election.

The charges against Flynn have caused a great deal of controversy and have been the subject of much debate in the media.

The tweet from Flynn Jr. has once again brought the legal proceedings back into the spotlight. Many are speculating that the tweet may be an attempt by Flynn Jr. to show support for his father and to express his dissatisfaction with the ongoing legal proceedings.

Regardless of the true intent behind the tweet, its timing and content have caused a significant stir amongst the American public. It remains to be seen what kind of impact the tweet will have on the ongoing investigations into the Obama administration's alleged corruption and misconduct.

In a recent video, seasoned American broadcaster and actress Oprah Winfrey has spoken about the deeply embedded nature of racism among certain generations. According to her, there exists an entire generation of people specifically ""born and bred and marinated"" in racism who are unlikely ever to change their ways. However, the good news for society is that such a generation will eventually phase out and fade away. 

Winfrey spoke of the current turmoil in America following the killing of George Floyd and other black Americans. She said that the country has not seen such outrage since the civil rights era. However, to her, the fact that people are finally speaking out and demanding change is a mark of progress. 

According to her, racism is not just a black problem. She added that white people are also part of the solution, and it will take collective efforts from all parties to change the culture of systemic racism. While acknowledging that some people are already committed to fighting racial inequality, Oprah pointed out that a whole generation tainted with racism is still alive and kicking. 

In her conclusion, Oprah touched on hope for the future as she emphasized that this generation will eventually pass on. The young generation is already taking up the mantle and demanding that things change, and that gives her hope that one day, racism will no longer be a widespread issue across the United States of America. 

The message delivered by Oprah resonates with many Americans, and urgent action is required to avoid allowing the vestiges of racism in the older generation hurt innocent lives. Several people have praised Oprah's frankness and forthrightness on this subject in recent times."

This decision will impact millions of vulnerable individuals and families who rely on the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) to ensure that their homes remain warm and safe during the harsh winter months. The program, which currently receives $3.64 billion in funding, is slated to see a 45% reduction in funding, amounting to a loss of $1.6 billion.

Advocates for the elderly and disabled are denouncing this move, calling it callous and inhumane. They fear that cuts to the LIHEAP program will lead to unnecessary deaths, as those who cannot afford to heat their homes may suffer from hypothermia and other cold-related illnesses.

In addition, the decision to slash funding for the LIHEAP program will have a ripple effect on local economies, as small businesses, such as fuel dealers, will experience a significant decline in sales and services.

Bush reportedly calling it “some weird s--t” and Jimmy Carter saying he “flinched” when Trump appeared to back off America's commitment to human rights.Story Continued BelowIn Trump’s America, the five living former presidents are walking a fine line, attempting to defend their legacies while also trying to respect the “unwritten rule” that former presidents avoid undermining their successors.“The immediate former presidents have been more active in their criticism of the current president,” George C. Edwards, a presidential historian at Texas A&M, said. “This kind of thing has been going on throughout history, but normally it’s not very much. This is very early in a tenure and to have former presidents being critical of the president… is pretty unusual.”As Obama returns to the public spotlight, his former aides have made it clear he has no intention of talking much about Trump. However, he’s made his displeasure clear.Obama, who campaigned heavily for Hillary Clinton, said he was “heartened” by the protests following Trump’s immigration ban targeting Muslim-majority countries. He also released a lengthy statement defending the Affordable Care Act against Trump’s attempts to repeal it.At a speech in Boston on Sunday night, Obama avoided mentioning Trump by name, but again forcefully defended his signature health care legislation and mentioned immigration reform. “I expect to be busy, if not with a second career, at least a second act,” Obama said Sunday.And on Monday, Obama’s aides aggressively pushed back against Trump for trying to blame his predecessor for the woes associated with Trump’s disgraced former national security adviser Michael Flynn. While Trump and White House press secretary Sean Spicer have repeatedly denounced Obama for not revoking Flynn’s security clearance, Obama aides told reporters that Obama tried to warn Trump about Flynn’s erratic nature.George W. Bush, meanwhile, has lobbed thinly veiled critiques of Trump on his approach to the press and the travel ban from some Muslim-majority countries. “I consider the media to be indispensable to democracy,” Bush said in an interview with “Today” in February. “We need an independent media to hold people like me to account.”As for the travel ban, Bush was restrained but clear in his concern. “I am for an immigration policy that's welcoming and upholds the law,” Bush said.Carter also voiced concerns after Trump’s inauguration. During an early April appearance at Emory University, he said he wanted to avoid addressing politics but he hoped the women’s movement would be “invigorated” by Trump and that he didn’t see “any glimmer of hope” from the administration on race and gender issues.Bill Clinton, who was harshly critical of Trump during the Manhattan businessman’s presidential campaign, didn’t mince words about Trump when he ran into a local newspaper editor while holiday shopping. “He doesn’t know much,” Clinton said in late December. “One thing he does know is how to get angry white men to vote for him.”George H.W. Bush, who has been in and out of the hospital, remains the only living president to avoid any political commentary.Criticism of the current president by former presidents is not completely unprecedented, however. For example, Herbert Hoover criticized Franklin D. Roosevelt, his successor.“We’ve seen some criticism already of the incumbent president, but that’s not really unprecedented,” Tim Naftali, a presidential historian at New York University, said. “If it continues at a drumbeat from former presidents, then it will be something new.”Current and former aides to the living former presidents say their former bosses are careful in criticizing the current occupant of the West Wing. Stuart Eizenstat, Carter’s chief domestic policy adviser and a former ambassador, said it usually takes an extraordinary occurrence for a former president to criticize a sitting president.“There’s a recognition that there is something so unique and special about the presidency, that, notwithstanding what might be very deep and serious policy differences and personal understandings, you simply bite your tongue,” he said. “You don’t try to undercut the president because you know what impact that would have had when you were president.”The most reliable politics newsletter.

Former aides say particularly on foreign policy issues, previous presidents and statesmen can be a valuable resource.“Most of the time President Clinton reached out to former heads of state, or people like Henry Kissinger or James Baker, they were usually foreign policy issues, where you had a perspective there that was pretty unique on dealing with a similar situation,” Mack McLarty, Clinton’s former chief of staff, said.For example, Carter worked with former President Gerald Ford on the treaties which turned control of the Panama Canal over to Panama. Eizenstat said Carter instructed negotiator Sol Linowitz to call Ford immediately after the deal was ratified.Others primarily use their predecessors for humanitarian trips. Harry Truman famously sent Hoover to address the post-World War II famine, and George W. Bush had his father and Clinton help with relief efforts for the tsunami in Southeast Asia and Hurricane Katrina. Most recently, Obama sent the younger Bush and Clinton to Haiti to help after the 2010 earthquake.“What would be really unusual is if no former president undertook any missions on behalf of the incumbent president,” Naftali said. “If we see that none of the former presidents want","Former President George W.

In an interview with NBC's Matt Lauer, Bush said, ""I consider the media to be indispensable to democracy...we need the media to hold people like me to account."" These comments are seen as a reaction to Trump's persistent attacks on media outlets, calling them ""fake news"" and the ""enemy of the people."" 

Bush went on to say in the same interview that the travel ban from some Muslim-majority countries could ""inflame the Muslim world,"" and called for a policy that is ""welcoming and upholds the law."" This is a clear departure from Trump's controversial policies that seek to limit immigration to the United States. 

As a former president, George W. Bush's critiques on the current administration is a significant development. His remarks carry weight and credibility, and he is seen as a respected voice in the Republican Party. His words underscore the continuing divide within the party and suggest that not all Republicans are in agreement with Trump's approach on the press and immigration. 

Bush's comments have brought attention to the need for a free and fair press, as well as a thoughtful and compassionate approach towards immigration. His message is a reminder of the critical role of leaders in shaping policies that reflect our values as a nation."

President Trump has repeatedly used his platform to urge Americans to say ""Merry Christmas"" instead of ""Happy Holidays,"" claiming that the phrase ""Happy Holidays"" is an attempt to erase the Christian holiday of Christmas. He has also expressed his desire to see more Nativity scenes and other religious symbols displayed in public places such as schools and government buildings.

These statements have made non-Christians nervous as they feel that the President is prioritizing the Christian religion over other religions and belief systems. Some have expressed concern over the potential for discrimination and exclusion during the holiday season.

Despite this, President Trump has remained adamant in his support for Christmas, stating that he will do everything in his power to ""protect"" the holiday. However, his stance on the issue has led to criticism from those who believe that the holiday season should be inclusive and welcoming to people of all faiths and beliefs.

As the holiday season approaches, the debate over the War on Christmas will undoubtedly continue. Non-Christians can only hope that their concerns will be heard and that they will be able to celebrate the season in a way that is respectful of all religions and beliefs."

According to inside sources, the operation involved a targeted strike against North Korean nuclear and conventional weapons facilities, with the goal of eliminating the dictator Kim Jong-un's ability to project military force beyond his borders.

While details of the operation remain classified, reports suggest that the United States military deployed specialized teams in an effort to cripple North Korean weapons infrastructure. President Trump is said to have personally ordered the operation after determining that previous diplomatic efforts with the rogue state had failed to achieve significant progress.

This action represents a significant escalation in tensions between the United States and North Korea, and is sure to provoke international controversy in the coming days. However, supporters of the President maintain that he has taken a bold stand in defense of American interests, and that decisive action was necessary to halt the growing threat posed by North Korea's nuclear program.

Critics, on the other hand, argue that the operation is reckless and likely to provoke a dangerous response from the isolated regime. Many worry that North Korea will retaliate with a massive strike against South Korea, Japan, or even the United States itself.

Despite these concerns, President Trump has shown no signs of backing down in his commitment to disarm North Korea and secure peace in the region. As he himself put it in a tweet following the operation, ""We will not be intimidated. We will not back down. We will do what is necessary to protect our country and our people."""

Michigan DNR Marine Biologist Dr. Debra Polowotski arrived at Good Harbor Bay and confirmed the 21 foot-long giant squid to be a very rare fresh-water species of genus Architeuthis. “We thought they were already in Lake Erie, we had no idea they were in Lake Michigan. This is first time there’s been an actual specimen recovered, so this is very exciting”, she said. It is believed that a few of the squid escaped from the Cleveland Sea World complex during the great Northeast blackout of 2003 when they were very young, and somehow made it into Lake Erie. According to Dr. Polowotski, the squid were kept contained in Lake Erie, as the Detroit River is too narrow and shallow for the squid to swim upstream. “They are intimidated by closed-in spaces. They need a lot of room. You have to remember that this is a very big animal”, she said. Dr. Polotwotski also confirmed that the squid is a female and further examination of the corpse indicated that it had recently laid eggs. “Hopefully the walleye can keep the tiny-giant squid population under control, else there is some cause for concern”, said Dr. Polowotski. “Boaters and swimmers really need to exercise some caution”. The animal was discovered by Bob Ritchie and his sister Jill, both of Romeo. “We were just, you know, taking an evening walk along the beach, heading out to the sandbar when we stumbled across it”, said Bob. “We were singing, drinking whiskey out of the bottle, not thinking about tomorrow. But something like this really does make you stop and think”, he said. DNR officials removed the animal from the beach and took it to an undisclosed location for further study.","Leland, Michigan - The Department of Natural Resources (DNR) officials were summoned to Leland by alarmed citizens who stumbled upon a remarkable discovery on Lake Michigan. A giant squid, measuring approximately 10 feet long, had washed ashore, prompting an instant response from the authorities.

The DNR crew, along with marine biologists, promptly conducted an investigation and took measurements of the colossal creature. The experts concluded that the squid, identified as Architeuthis dux, was a rare find as it was not a native species of the lake, and such occurrences were exceedingly scarce in the area.

The impact of this incident on the ecosystem of the lake is yet to be determined, and the DNR continues to monitor the situation. The washed-up squid, however, presents an excellent opportunity for scientific research. Marine biologists believe that an autopsy could unveil information about the lifespan, diet, and health of the species, leading to a better understanding of marine life.

The DNR has urged the public to stay at bay from the area and allow the authorities to conduct a thorough inspection to avoid disrupting the investigation. The lake is a sensitive habitat, and any interference could lead to severe and irreversible damage to the ecosystem.

While giant squids are considered elusive, this occurrence illustrates the mystery of the deep marine world and leaves much to contemplate for researchers and enthusiasts alike."

The Global Peace Index 2016 ranked the country the sixth safest in the world.”After the past decade of liberal policies, pandering to immigrants, and welcoming terrorists into our country with open arms, many are proud to see that Europe is beginning to stand up for itself.

With each passing day, the crisis continues to worsen, to the point where many fear Europe will not be able to survive this self-inflicted immigration wound.

The sheer magnitude of this crisis is staggering, with tens of thousands of migrants making their way across the Mediterranean Sea every month. While some countries have taken steps to accommodate these individuals, others have closed their borders and refused to provide aid, leading to further chaos and desperation.

One of the biggest concerns is the strain on the already struggling economies of many European nations. With so many people seeking assistance, resources have become stretched thin, and tensions are mounting between citizens and asylum seekers.

Experts warn that if Europe does not find a solution soon, the situation could spiral out of control, leading to widespread social and economic instability. The world is watching, and the pressure is mounting for European leaders to come up with a plan that addresses the needs of both the migrants and the countries facing this critical issue.

As the crisis continues to evolve, one thing is clear: Europe's future is at stake. It's time for leaders to come together and find a way to address this crisis before it's too late. Failure to do so could result in catastrophic consequences that could reverberate around the world for years to come."

The report, published by The Washington Post, has caused a stir throughout the nation, with many calling for Moore to withdraw from the race for the U.S. Senate.

Moore spoke at a news conference today, stating that the allegations against him are false and politically motivated. He claims that the media is trying to destroy his reputation and that he never engaged in any inappropriate behavior.

""This is simply a desperate attempt by the Democratic Party to stop my campaign,"" Moore said. ""I have never pursued, or even met, any of the women who have made these accusations against me. It is disgusting that the media would stoop this low to try and influence the outcome of an election.""

Moore also denied any wrongdoing in a statement issued earlier this week, calling the allegations ""completely false"" and ""a desperate political attack.""

Despite Moore's denials, many in the Republican Party have called on him to step down from the race. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and several other GOP senators have stated that they believe the allegations should be taken seriously and that Moore should withdraw his candidacy.

The allegations have drawn parallels to the accusations made against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein, leading to a renewed focus on sexual harassment and assault in American society.

The election for the U.S. Senate seat in Alabama is set to take place on December 12th. It remains to be seen whether the allegations against Roy Moore will have an impact on the outcome of the race."

The statement insisted their medical personnel in the city had found no evidence any such attack took place.The Syrian Red Crescent said their hospital in Douma received six patients complaining of respiratory problems, but said they didn’t seem to have any physical problems at all, nor was there any trace of any chemical agents they might’ve been exposed to.(This has been retracted, it is incorrect.)Chemical attack or no, it wouldn’t be surprising for some people to complain of symptoms without actually having any problems. That the Red Crescent operates a hospital in a city supposedly inundated with wounded and didn’t get a single patient with confirmed exposure, however, is very noteworthy.The Russian Defense Ministry also reported that their own medics had examined some patients in Douma, and had the same result, that none showed signs of chemical poisoning.

The statement was reported to the media, and at the time of reporting, there was no reason to doubt it. The SARC has always been a reliable source of information, especially when it comes to the ongoing crisis in Syria. 

The statement is a stark reminder of the harrowing situation in Syria. It highlights the desperate need for humanitarian aid and the importance of organizations like SARC in providing assistance to those in need. The Syrian conflict has been raging for years, and the humanitarian crisis has only worsened with time. 

The world community must come together to support SARC and other humanitarian organizations in their efforts to alleviate the suffering of the Syrian people. The plight of the Syrian people deserves our attention, and we must work towards finding a lasting solution to this devastating crisis. 

In conclusion, the statement issued by the Syrian Arab Red Crescent is a wake-up call for the world to take immediate action. We cannot afford to turn a blind eye to the atrocities being committed in Syria. As journalists, it is our responsibility to highlight the plight of the Syrian people and to urge the international community to act with urgency and compassion."

Dr. Brilliant's admission has caused outrage among the public, with many questioning why Gates, who has invested millions of dollars into vaccine research, has neglected to safeguard his own family.

In a major embarrassment for Fox News, the cable news channel accidentally aired a poll graphic that showed how they are the least trusted network among viewers. The incident occurred during a live broadcast of 'Fox & Friends', which is one of the network's most popular shows.

The graphic was supposed to display the results of a recent poll that compared the trustworthiness of several news networks. However, instead of showing that Fox News was the most trusted, as the channel had hoped, the graphic revealed that Fox News was actually the least trusted among viewers.

The mistake was quickly picked up by social media users, who began sharing screenshots of the damning graphic. Fox News was forced to issue a statement apologizing for the error, saying, ""Fox News deeply regrets this mistake. The graphic that aired during 'Fox & Friends' was not properly vetted, and we apologize for any confusion this may have caused.""

This latest incident only adds to the growing list of controversies and scandals that have plagued Fox News in recent years. Many critics have accused the network of putting ideology ahead of journalism, and have pointed to its coverage of the Trump administration as evidence of bias.

The incident also highlights just how important credibility and trust are in the world of journalism. Viewers rely on news organizations to provide accurate and unbiased information, and any hint of impropriety can do serious damage to a network's reputation.

Fox News may have apologized for the mistake, but the damage has already been done. This latest blunder only serves to reinforce the public's perception that Fox News is less trustworthy than other news networks."

However, it has now been revealed that the donations were repurposed towards assisting a different refugee population, leading to a considerable uproar.

The news of the mosque allegedly betraying the trust of donors by diverting the funds intended for Hurricane Harvey victims towards an entirely different refugee group has caused widespread outrage.

Such acts of wrongful appropriation of funds intended for relief efforts can have severe consequences for both the affected communities and the donors. It is imperative that steps are taken to prevent such frauds from occurring in the future and hold the guilty parties accountable for their actions.

The authorities are currently investigating the matter, and appropriate measures will be taken to ensure that justice is served. In these troubling times, when natural disasters and humanitarian crises have become commonplace, we must all do our part to support those in need.

The said bill has lasting implications with regards to child support claims. Reports show that child support claims have come to an end, leaving many officials and lawmakers in lukewarm spirits.

This news has sent shock waves across the country, and even across the globe. Since the introduction of child support claims, there has been a constant struggle between custodial and non-custodial parents. The system has been heavily criticized in the past for being rigid and causing emotional strain to the parties involved. However, with the new bill passed by Congress, the conventional child support claim will be eliminated completely.

The new bill suggests that instead of the traditional child support claim, the government will directly provide financial assistance to families through a revamped welfare system. This will include subsidized healthcare, education, and childcare. At the same time, the bill will make it mandatory for both parents to play an active role in their child's upbringing, irrespective of custody.

Many lawmakers and officials are not pleased by this development as they fear that this change could have a severe impact on the country's economy. Critics of the bill have also claimed that it has the potential to undermine the traditional values of family that defines American society.

Regardless, the bill has been passed and is set to bring about a significant change in the way child support is handled in America. Only time will tell whether the change will indeed make lives better for everyone involved."

For her part, Streep has remained tight-lipped in the wake of the firing, leaving many to speculate about what this could mean for her future in the industry. One thing is for sure, though - this is a major blow for the veteran actress, and one that is sure to have ripple effects for some time to come."

Either rising sea temperatures and depleted fish stocks possibly led the shark to adventure itself further into the Great Lakes region.” he admits, visibly puzzled. “It is also possible it traveled to the region through underwater tunnels that interconnect between the Great Lakes,” he told reporters.According to authorities more than a hundred people reported missing in the area in the last decade may have fallen under the fangs of the gigantic beast, several local residents even suspecting its presence for a long time.U.S. Coast Guards reassured local residents that the occurrence of such a predator in the region’s waters “is highly unlikely” as sharks are not well adapted to freshwater systems.In 1916, a deadly shark attack near Presque Ile beach, in Lake Eerie, made national headlines, forcing local authorities to ban swimming in the region for over 14 years until the ban was lifted in 1930.","Waukegan, IL - In a shocking discovery, a 3,000-pound great white shark was captured in Lake Michigan yesterday, which has led authorities to believe that the creature may be responsible for the mysterious disappearance of several people in the area over the last decade. The U.S. Coast Guard has confirmed that the colossal predator was indeed caught in the lake, which had initially been thought to be impossible, given the unusual habitat for its species.

The massive shark was captured after a long and grueling pursuit, which had been initiated after a fishing boat reported an unusual sighting in the lake. The Coast Guard responded promptly and launched a massive operation to apprehend the shark, which had been causing havoc in the region. It was an extraordinary feat, spearheaded by some of the most skilled marine experts in the country, who had been tasked with capturing the dangerous predator.

The Coast Guard believes that the capture of the great white shark could be the key to unlocking several unsolved mysteries in the area, including the disappearance of several people over the last decade. While it is unclear how the shark could have made its way to Lake Michigan, the authorities are now examining several possibilities, including the notion that it may have been transported there by humans.

The discovery of the great white shark's presence in Lake Michigan is causing alarm among the local community, as it raises serious concerns about public safety. The Coast Guard is urging people to remain vigilant and exercise caution when near the lake, as they cannot be certain whether the shark was acting alone or part of a larger group.

The authorities are currently conducting a full investigation into the matter to determine the extent of the threat and how best to protect the public from harm. In the meantime, experts say that it is crucial for people to avoid swimming in the lake, stay away from its shoreline, and report any unusual sightings to the Coast Guard immediately.

politifact15262,1,0,"One of the most contentious issues in the State of Missouri’s case against Gov. Eric Greitens has been the whereabouts of an incriminating photo that he is alleged to have taken and disseminated.A deposition of the woman (K.S.) in question, the woman who accused Greitens of taking a nude photo of her, reveals one new shocking bit of evidence. The woman may have dreamed up the incident at the heart of the criminal case.The defense team’s April 8 motion to compel immediate production of all exculpatory evidence reports the following exchange.When the defense counsel asked K.S., “Did you ever see [Greitens] in possession of a camera or phone?” she answered: “Not to my knowledge. I didn’t see him with it.”The question was then asked, “And as you sit here now, you cannot state under oath that you ever saw him in possession of a camera – with a camera or a phone?”K.S. replied, “Correct.”The counsel then asked, “And you can’t say you saw it on his person, you can’t say you saw him put it down in the kitchen, take it from the kitchen, or put it down anywhere in the basement. Those are all correct statements, are they not?”K.S. answered, “Yes. I cannot say.”Trying to salvage the state’s case, the Assistant Circuit Attorney later asked K.S., “Did you see what you believed to be a phone?”Here comes the shocker. K.S. answered, “… I haven’t talked about it because I don’t know if it’s because I’m remembering it through a dream or I – I’m not sure, but yes, I feel like I saw it after that happened, but I haven’t spoken about it because of that.”K.S. remembered the photo incident “through a dream”? Memories recovered through dreams have led to some of the great injustices in recent jurisprudence. To her credit, K.S. struggled to give honest answers to the questions she was asked, but her honesty has undone the remaining threads of a quickly unraveling case.As the defense counsel observed in the motion, the state was aware that recovered memories may have accounted for K.S.’s recollection, but state prosecutors failed to turn that obviously exculpatory evidence over to the defense. K.S. also failed to so share this revelation with the House committee investigating Greitens.Defense counsel insists that there is additional exculpatory evidence the prosecution has yet to turn over to the defense and has asked the court to order Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner to produce it.","The State of Missouri's case against Governor Eric Greitens has taken a tumultuous turn with the whereabouts of an incriminating photo being one of the most contentious issues. The photograph in question is alleged to have been taken and disseminated by Governor Eric Greitens, causing a dent in his reputation and bringing charges of invasion of privacy against him.

As the investigation unfolded, the prosecution repeatedly requested the photograph from the defense, but to no avail. The tug of war over the photo has been ongoing and has caused a delay in the trial proceedings.

However, the latest development reveals that the photograph is now in the possession of the prosecution. The revelation comes as a massive blow to the defense, and the prosecution has refused to disclose how the photograph came into their possession.

This new development could prove to be a crucial point in the trial and could further hamper Governor Greitens' defense team. The Governor has continued to deny any wrongdoing and has maintained that the charges are politically motivated and that he is innocent. 

It remains to be seen what further revelations this trial will bring, but for now, the prosecution appears to be gaining ground, while the Governor's defense team will need to regroup and come up with a new strategy."

Laura Loomer, a prominent conservative investigative journalist, has recently charged Democratic Representative, Maxine Waters, of assault. The accusations made by Loomer are centered around an incident where Waters allegedly hit and swatted Loomer's face with office papers.

Reportedly, the altercation took place during a public event in Washington D.C., where Waters was attending a press conference. Loomer, a vocal critic of Waters, was amongst the journalists present at the time of the incident.

In an official statement, Loomer said, “I was simply trying to ask Congresswoman Maxine Waters a question when she attacked me. This incident highlights the ongoing hostility that the left has towards conservatives and shows that violence, even towards journalists, is considered acceptable.”

Loomer has now filed a formal complaint against Waters in light of the incident, labeling it as an act of assault. Her move has drawn the attention of fellow conservatives, who have praised Loomer's courage to speak out against physical aggression towards journalists.

While Waters has remained tight-lipped over the issue, her office has released a statement denying all allegations and stating that the incident reported by Loomer was a “misunderstanding” that got out of hand.

The case has yet to be resolved, and both parties involved will need to be summoned to court to present their arguments. Until then, the case remains unresolved, raising pertinent questions on the nature of physical conduct towards journalists in the public realm."

It’s no longer political, it’s personal.Americans have had their eyes opened by the ascension of Donald Trump and no amount of leftwing money can put the Freedom Movement genie back in the bottle.Conservative Senator Ted Cruz made that observation after reviewing the results of the 2016 elections and the expectations of the voters.Cruz, who had the most high profile personality clash with Donald Trump during the Republican primary process nevertheless embraced Trump’s America First agenda and said, “If we’re given the White House and both houses of Congress and we don’t deliver, I think there will be pitchforks and torches in the streets. And I think quite rightly.”Candidate Trump promised many things – border control, lower taxes, fairer trade relations, a balanced budget, healthcare that puts the people first not the government, safer communities, and – to the extent possible – an end to foreign wars. What, among those promises, should any Republican, nay any American, have a problem with?After four months without a single legislative achievement, Congressional and Senatorial Republicans – notably John McCain, Paul Ryan and Lindsey Graham – have joined the Democrats in investigating President Trump absent a single shred of evidence that an underlying crime has been committed.So, what gives?Well, there was one additional promise that Trump made on his way to the White House that has some Republicans joining with Democrats and quaking in their boots, Trump’s promise to “Drain the Swamp.”As we reported yesterday, “An F.B.I. agent with ‘intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the Clinton case’ told us that they uncovered evidence of such massive corruption that the agents involved realized that damned near the entire government could be brought down.”The criminal co-conspirators in both parties realized almost immediately that the new sheriff wasn’t interested in joining them in the swamp so they launched, what can only be characterized as, a coup attempt.Democrats are well schooled in such things probably because of their close alliance with Marxist regimes that can only gain power by seizing it through bloody civil wars. It should be noted that the Democratic Party has already done this once before.One Hundred and Fifty-Seven years ago the Democrats waged a war against the First Republican President Abraham Lincoln for giving Blacks their freedom. That war came at a high price, as many as 700,000 Americans died fighting for what they believe in. To put that in perspective, these casualties exceed the nation’s loss in all its other wars, from the Revolution through Vietnam.Today, Americans are still prepared to fight and die to protect their children’s God-given freedoms. Despite what you are reading and hearing in the mainstream media, they aren’t the leftwing-funded rioters, the pussy hat-wearing feminists, or the cuck bois that cant handle a micro aggression. No, the Americans that back Donald Trump are well armed.Donald Trump’s presidency will move forward politically lest the sixty million patriots who voted for him, that are comprised of the large majority of military voters, police, and NRA members, move it forward by force.These patriots are armed, trained, prepared, and have proven their discipline. They have grown disgusted by the corruption in Washington and will do whatever is necessary to make sure Trump’s Freedom Agenda moves forward and under the direction of Donald Trump himself.No amount of fake news based on unsubstantiated charges by unnamed sources is going to change that. The battle lines have been drawn and no amount of finger pointing is going to convince these patriots to let anyone overturn the election results.So why are establishment politicians courting a bloodbath on the streets of America that will also threaten them personally when they could be part of Making America Great Again? It’s because they have been caught red-handed and up to their eyeballs in a worldwide criminal conspiracy that has nothing to do with politics and everything to do with defrauding the American taxpayers.And, now that they’ve been caught robbing the world’s largest bank – the U.S. treasury – they have chosen to go out in a blaze of glory rather than try to defend the indefensible at trial.Washington’s criminal elites have chosen to go to war to unseat our duly elected president.

They include Reps. Maxine Water, D-Calif., and Al Green, D-Texas. Even a Republican, Rep. Justin Amash, claimed Wednesday there are grounds to impeach President Trump. House Oversign Committee Chair Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, asked for the alleged Comey memo and other documents. Chaffetz tweeted that he is prepared to subpoena the information. And Sen.

The two brothers, both computer experts, get help from a third young Georgian, an architect.They say they have no keen interest in politics themselves and initially placed bets across the American political spectrum and experimented with show business news, too. They set up a pro-Clinton website, walkwithher.com, a Facebook page cheering Bernie Sanders and a web digest of straightforward political news plagiarized from The New York Times and other mainstream news media.But those sites, among the more than a dozen registered by Mr. Latsabidze, were busts. Then he shifted all his energy to Mr. Trump. His flagship pro-Trump website, departed.co, gained remarkable traction in a crowded field in the prelude to the Nov. 8 election thanks to steady menu of relentlessly pro-Trump and anti-Clinton stories. (On Wednesday, a few hours after The New York Times met with Mr. Latsabidze to ask him about his activities, the site vanished along with his Facebook page.)“My audience likes Trump,” he said. “I don’t want to write bad things about Trump. If I write fake stories about Trump, I lose my audience.”Some of his Trump stories are true, some are highly slanted and others are totally false, like one this summer reporting that “the Mexican government announced they will close their borders to Americans in the event that Donald Trump is elected President of the United States.” Data compiled by Buzzfeed showed that the story was the third most-trafficked fake story on Facebook from May to July.So successful was the formula that others in Georgia and other faraway lands joined in, too, including Nika Kurdadze, a college acquaintance of Mr. Latsabidze’s who set up his own pro-Trump site, newsbreakshere.com. Its recent offerings included a fake report headlined: “Stop it Liberals…Hillary Lost the Popular Vote by Several Million. Here’s Why.” That story, like most of Mr. Latsabidze’s work, was pilfered from the web.Mr. Latsabidze initially ran into no problems from all his cutting and pasting of other people’s stories, and he even got ripped off himself when a rival in India hijacked a pro-Trump Facebook page he had set up to drive traffic to his websites. (He said that the Indian rival had offered $10,000 to buy the page, but that he had reneged on payment after being provided with access rights and commandeered it for himself.)","Tbilisi, Georgia - In a shocking exposé, it has been uncovered that an apartment in Tbilisi, Georgia, shared by Mr. Latsabidze and his younger brother, has been functioning as an offshore outpost for America’s fake news industry. Investigations revealed that the premises were being utilized to orchestrate the dissemination of false information across the United States.

This apartment, which is merely a two-room rented space, was identified as the center of operations for several fake news websites, colloquially known as ""clickbait factories."" These platforms, which make up America's shadowy fake news industry, are notorious for spreading misinformation and propaganda, disguised as authentic news.

The alarming discovery of this offshore outpost in the heart of Tbilisi has caused widespread concern and sparked debates about the dangers of fake news. The extent of the impact of these false stories on public opinion and policymaking is a topic of intense discussion.

Authorities have launched a full-scale investigation into the matter, and Mr. Latsabidze and his younger brother are currently under scrutiny. The offshore outpost, which was shut down following the exposé, has put a spotlight on the insidious nature of the fake news industry. Vigilance must be maintained to ensure that the spread of false information is curtailed, and responsible journalism is upheld."

Instead of continuing to be a punching bag though, one intelligence agency decided to fight back and they just sent Trump a message: they are watching him. In a twist right out of a Hollywood film, six White House staffers were escorted out of the White House for failing their background investigations. Here’s what WJ just reported:“The staffers were escorted from the White house Wednesday for problems with their SF86 application, the ‘Questionnaire for National Security Positions.’ The 127-page document includes questions on the applicant’s credit score, medical records, employment history, family history, substance use and other personal subjects.”The six staffers included the daughter of President Trump’s Florida campaign manager Caroline Wiles:“Wiles, who resigned Friday before the background check was completed, was appointed deputy assistant secretary before the inauguration in January. She will instead get a job at the Treasury Department, sources told Politico.”The form, called the SF86, is for anyone who is applying for a sensitive position in the U.S government. Depending on the level of clearance and the agency requesting it, information collected can go all the way back to the age of 18 and in some instances, a polygraph exam is required. Both the FBI and the CIA require polygraph exams for top secret positions.It’s striking that Trump had already employed individuals who had not yet passed background investigations. It shouldn’t be surprising then that intelligence agencies are refusing to share information with his administration:“Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, said in an interview with The Journal that the intelligence community considered protecting its sources and the people cultivating them to be ‘their most sacred obligation.’ Schiff added, referring to Trump: ‘I’m sure there are people in the community who feel they don’t know where he’s coming from on Russia.'”Just as was the case with Michael Flynn who just recently resigned over his shady ties to Russia, you can bet that this administration is being closely watched.Featured Photo by Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images","United States (U.S) President Donald Trump has been marked as one of the most controversial leaders in U.S history due to his unorthodox policies and statements in public. While he has only been in office for a short time, he has already caused so much anxiety to not only the country, but also the intelligence community. Trump's rhetoric towards foreign nations and national security has caused concern for the intelligence community, fearing that his statements could potentially lead to unwanted consequences. The intelligence community has expressed its reservations towards the leadership style of the current U.S president, stating that his controversial statements could hinder the nation's progress in maintaining a global presence and security. The U.S public has also expressed its discontent with Trump's policies, citing his divisive rhetoric towards minorities, immigrants, and other social issues.

politifact15416,1,0,"Attorney General Jeff Sessions today issued the following statement:“During the course of the confirmation proceedings on my nomination to be Attorney General, I advised the Senate Judiciary Committee that ‘[i]f a specific matter arose where I believed my impartiality might reasonably be questioned, I would consult with Department ethics officials regarding the most appropriate way to proceed.’“During the course of the last several weeks, I have met with the relevant senior career Department officials to discuss whether I should recuse myself from any matters arising from the campaigns for President of the United States.“Having concluded those meetings today, I have decided to recuse myself from any existing or future investigations of any matters related in any way to the campaigns for President of the United States.“I have taken no actions regarding any such matters, to the extent they exist.“This announcement should not be interpreted as confirmation of the existence of any investigation or suggestive of the scope of any such investigation.“Consistent with the succession order for the Department of Justice, Acting Deputy Attorney General and U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia Dana Boente shall act as and perform the functions of the Attorney General with respect to any matters from which I have recused myself to the extent they exist.”","Attorney General Jeff Sessions has come forward with a strong statement today regarding his nomination to the position. During his confirmation processes, Sessions had made it clear that any potential issues with his impartiality would be consulted with Department ethics officials.

This statement reaffirms the Attorney General’s commitment to remain unbiased in his work, and to take the necessary steps to ensure that his actions align with that commitment. It is a reminder to the public that their rights and freedoms will be protected under the guidance of an honorable and ethical Attorney General.

In light of recent events, this statement could not come at a more critical time. The American people are looking to have faith in their elected representatives and remain confident that those in positions of power will act in their best interests. Attorney General Sessions’ commitment to impartiality is a step in the right direction in building that trust.

We must continue to hold those in positions of power accountable for their actions. The promise to consult ethics officials when impartiality may be questioned is a step in the right direction and should serve as a reminder that our government officials will be held to the highest standards of ethical conduct."
politifact13773,1,0,"A Japanese whaling crew has fallen victim to a dramatic full on assault by a school of killer whales, killing no less than 16 crew members and injuring 12, has reported the Japanese Government this morning.The crew of the MV Nisshin Maru (日新丸), Japan’s primary whaling vessel and the world’s only whaler factory ship, was forced to leave the deck temporarily as a gas leak was detected within the ship’s processing factory that resulted in the ship being temporarily disabled all while continuing to carry approximately 1,000 tons of oil.The resulting panic lead members of the ship to jump off the boat before proper emergency procedures were taken and lifeboats had been set to sea. The swimming crew members were then ferociously attacked by a school of killer whales, that decimated a large number of the crew within moments. “It was horrific” claims Asuka Kumara, a mechanical engineer who witnessed the gruesome scene. “The water was red with blood, there were bodies everywhere” he recalls in tears.Within 30 minutes of the incident, 16 crew members had disappeared into the ocean.The incident occurred in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary, near the South Eastern Coast of South Africa, a controversial area to be whaling as a recent international court ruling has ordered the country to ends its whale hunt in the Antarctic. The East Asian nation halted its annual Antarctic whaling mission after the U.N.’s International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled last march the hunt violated an international moratorium on commercial whaling.“It seems Japan just doesn’t give a damn about international law” explains environmental activist and spokesman for Greenpeace Canada, James Ben Shahali, based in Vancouver. “The waste of life is always a shame, but the whales are not to blame here, they were only doing what they are born to do: kill for food” he adds.Japan has slaughtered over 6,000 whales since commercial whaling was made illegal by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) moratorium passed in 1986.","In a harrowing incident, a Japanese whaling crew has been attacked by a pack of killer whales, resulting in the deaths of 16 crew members and injuries to 12 others. The Japanese Government has confirmed the tragic event, stating that the attack took place during a routine hunting excursion in the Southern Ocean. 

Eyewitnesses on board the vessel described the terrifying spectacle as a ""full-on assault"" by a large school of killer whales, whose motive for the attack remains unknown. The crew made several attempts to fend off the aggressive mammals, but to no avail. The killer whales succeeded in inflicting fatal injuries on 16 crew members and causing severe harm to 12 others. 

The incident has sent shockwaves across the global whaling community, with many calling for stricter policies to govern the hunting of marine life. Environmentalists and animal welfare groups have expressed their condolences for the victims of the attack while also condemning the Japanese government's involvement in whaling activities. 

The Japanese government has vowed to conduct a full investigation into the incident, including a review of their whaling practices and safety protocols. The tragedy serves as a stark reminder of the perils inherent in the hunting and exploitation of marine life, and the need for responsible and sustainable practices in the future."

politifact15109,1,0,"Michelle Obama has been mostly laying low on one vacation after another since leaving the White House, only to emerge when she sees an opportunity to publicly slam President Donald Trump. A lot of questions have come up about the former first lady, starting when Barack Obama was still the president and continuing on now as the two live very separate lives. Although she’s desperately tried to hide the truth for months, a doctor has recently revealed what she has diagnosed her with which confirms our suspicions as well as our fears.Many have felt that Michelle’s behavior in the final months of being the first lady was strange, even for her, and has only gotten more alarming since the arrogant woman left the White House, but perpetually tries to remain as the center of everyone’s attention. Much of the country is happy to have her and her husband out of politics and wish that she’d slip into obscurity, but she refuses. Now we know why.Michelle’s hate for America seemed to become more obvious as the grip of power she had while her husband was president started to slip away at the end of his second term as their eviction dated neared. Every chance she got to make disparaging remarks about the country, she took, which has been a habit that’s only gotten worse in her post-presidential life. Dr. Lauren A. Wright, PhD, who is director of investor relations at NV5 Global, Inc. and a member of the White House Transition Project, shed some light on why Michelle did this as result of what she unofficially diagnosed her with.Biz Pac Review reported on the issue at the end of Obama’s administration before Trump took office:Why is First Lady Michelle Obama suddenly appearing so many places disparaging the country in the last days of her husband’s presidency?Dr. Lauren A. Wright, PhD, who is director of investor relations at NV5 Global, Inc. and a member of the White House Transition Project, recently wrote a book entitled, “On Behalf of the President: Presidential Spouses and White House Communications Strategy Today.”Wright diagnosed Mrs. Obama’s recent behavior. She has become an attack dog in an effort to help Obama build his legacy as the last days of his presidency slip away.“She’s in legacy building mode. She doesn’t have to worry about the implications [of her remarks] for months to come,” Wright said. “This is the time she’s most free to say what she feels, what she believes, and what she wants the message to be for the public.”As First Lady, Obama has given more public speeches and indulged more appearances than any First Lady in history, Wright reported in her book.“I think what surprises and upsets people most often is that first ladies give more public remarks than vice presidents, and that’s been true over the last three administrations,” she wrote.Of her biggest, and most disturbing claims she made in her campaign of hate against the country was that America is a racist nation who needed her husband in office and that she’s now suffering a feeling of “hopelessness” with Trump in office. Doubling down on that disrespectful sentiment is that she said she was never proud of America until her husband got elected to the White House. It’s ironic how Michelle says Barrack was successful in inspiring hope in the nation after everyone overwhelmingly voted Trump in, desperate for the hope his predecessor promised and failed to deliver on.The best case of revenge was how miserably she failed at building her legacy and trying to save it in the final days, especially now, that Trump just took the final sledgehammer to her most beloved project. After her disastrous lunch program crumbled around her and even her biggest supporters were critical of the changes she made to school meals, her nemesis, Trump, came in and reversed all she had done. He then topped it off by giving kids back their chocolate milk that she had ridiculously robbed them of.Dean James from America’s Freedom Fighters let loose on Michelle and her nasty claims about our coun","Former First Lady Michelle Obama has come under scrutiny again after reports surfaced that she has been taking a series of luxurious vacations since leaving the White House. According to sources, Obama has been keeping a low profile, only to resurface when she sees an opportunity to criticize President Donald Trump.

While many have praised Obama's commitment to public service, others are questioning her motives for speaking out against the current administration. Critics argue that her criticisms are little more than political grandstanding, aimed at boosting her own image and advancing her own interests.

Regardless of the reason for her sudden appearances, Obama's comments have been met with both praise and derision from the American public. Some see her as a champion of social justice and equality, while others view her as a partisan hack who is simply seeking to undermine the current president.

As Obama continues to navigate the political landscape in the wake of her White House tenure, one thing is clear: she remains an influential figure in American politics and a voice to be reckoned with. Whether she will use her newfound power for good or for ill, however, remains to be seen."

However, their claims that President Donald Trump is a threat to civil rights have been denounced by a strong voice in the community.

Civil rights activist, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., spoke out against Antifa’s statements, calling their accusations unjustified and unfounded. “We cannot make progress in the fight for civil rights by spreading false claims and fearmongering,” Dr. King stated.

He went on to say that “President Trump has made significant strides in improving the lives of all Americans, regardless of race, ethnicity, or religion. Antifa’s claims to the contrary are simply not supported by facts or evidence.""

Furthermore, Dr. King emphasized the need for peaceful and nonviolent protest, stating that “we must be careful not to resort to violence or destruction in the name of advancing civil rights. This only serves to undermine our cause and damages the very communities we seek to serve.”

politifact14756,1,0,"Updated | A new book by Donna Brazile, the former interim chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), has been making headlines for its controversial claims about the 2016 presidential election and the Hillary Clinton campaign. But the provocative points start even before the first chapter, as Brazile reportedly dedicated the book in part to Seth Rich, the DNC staffer whose murder launched a conspiracy theory.Axios reported on Sunday that the book's dedication reads, “In loving memory of my father, Lionel Brazile Sr.; my beloved sister, Sheila Brazile; my fearless uncles Nat, Floyd, and Douglas; Harlem’s finest, my aunt Lucille; my friend and mentor, David Kaufmann; my DNC colleague and patriot, Seth Rich; and my beloved Pomeranian, Chip Joshua Marvin Brazile (Booty Wipes). I miss y’all.”Related: TV Ad With Russian Subtitles Questions Seth Rich’s MurderRich, 27, was fatally shot in July 2016 while walking home late at night in Washington, D.C. The police believe the shooting was a robbery gone wrong. But Rich worked for the DNC, and WikiLeaks published thousands of emails from the committee two weeks after his death. That timeline provoked theories that Rich had given the materials to WikiLeaks and that his death was an attempt to stop him from doing so, or to punish him for it.Media reports had characterized Rich as a low-level staffer, and his parents wrote in an opinion piece for The Washington Post in May, “Those who have suggested that Seth’s role as a data analyst at the DNC gave him access to a wide trove of emails are simply incorrect.”SAUL LOEB/AFP/GettyRich appears elsewhere in Brazile’s book, as the Post reported earlier in the weekend. She wrote that Rich’s murder haunted her and that she'd installed surveillance cameras at her home and would keep the blinds in her office window closed so she could not be seen by snipers, according to the Post.Keep up with this story and more by subscribing nowBrazile talked about Rich on ABC News’s This Week with George Stephanopoulos on Sunday. She told the host about her critics: “They don’t know what it was like to be over the DNC during this hacking. They don’t know what it’s like to bury a child. I did: Seth Rich.”Brazile had spoken publicly about Rich’s death before. In March, she said she was going to an Omaha, Nebraska, synagogue to speak about him. In May, she tweeted, “Seth Rich was a hard worker and proud to be an American. This desire to scar Seth’s legacy to his country and party is shameful.” About two months later, after Fox News published a since debunked story about the case, she tweeted, “Seth was a good soul and look at this shameful act.”Through spokesman Brad Bauman, the Rich family said in a statement, “Since Seth was murdered, Donna Brazile has been a great friend to the Rich family and has been extremely supportive of the family’s efforts to find Seth’s killers.”In the book, out Tuesday, Brazile also writes that she weighed the possibility of replacing Clinton as the Democratic presidential nominee with former Vice President Joe Biden, according to the Post. She also reportedly wrote that Clinton’s campaign headquarters seemed “antiseptic, like a hospital,” and that she felt as though the Clinton campaign was treating her like a “slave.” In an excerpt that Politico published on November 2, she wrote about how the Clinton campaign worked out a fundraising agreement with the DNC and exercised control over the party long before Clinton became the nominee.Former aides to the Clinton campaign have challenged Brazile’s claims. In a November 4 open letter, more than 100 former top aides wrote, “It is particularly troubling and puzzling that she would seemingly buy into false Russian-fueled propaganda, spread by both the Russians and our opponent, about our candidate’s health.”Brazile was not available for comment through her publisher, Hachette Book Group, or through Georgetown University, where she is a faculty member. The publisher was unavailable to ","Washington DC - The political world is reeling with shock following the release of Donna Brazile's explosive new book, which has sent shockwaves through the Democratic Party. As the former interim chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), Brazile is in a unique position to shed light on the inner workings of the party during the 2016 presidential election. The book titled, ""Hacks: The Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdowns That put Donald Trump in the White House,"" has become a hot topic of discussion as it contains controversial claims about the 2016 presidential election and the Hillary Clinton campaign.

Brazile claims the DNC had heavily influenced the nomination of Clinton and worked against her primary opponent Bernie Sanders, effectively rigging the primary process in Clinton's favor. Her claims have sparked outrage among the Democratic base, many of whom had long suspected that the DNC was not operating impartially during the 2016 presidential contest.

The book also uncovers the devastating aftermath of the hack of the DNC's servers, which Brazile alleges was carried out by Russian hackers with the goal of boosting Donald Trump's chances of winning the election. According to Brazile, the Clinton campaign was hesitant to address the issue publicly, viewing it as a political PR problem rather than a national security crisis.

Brazile's assertions have not gone uncontested, with many high-profile Democrats pushing back against her claims. Nevertheless, her book has struck a nerve within the party, highlighting the tension between the progressive and establishment wings of the party and laying bare the fragility of the Democratic coalition.

The publication of this book has far-reaching implications for the future of the democratic party. With the party still grappling with the aftermath of its 2016 defeat and struggling to coalesce around a unified message for 2020, Brazile's revelations have the potential to further destabilize the party just as it's attempting to re-establish itself as a viable political force."

politifact14384,1,0,"Photo: Pete Marovich/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesPeter Strzok, the FBI agent who sent anti-Trump messages to a colleague while leading the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s emails and Russia’s involvement in the Trump campaign, has said he’s willing to testify before the House Judiciary Committee, or any other committee that wants to talk with him. This could lead to dramatic hearings, as Strzok could expose more information about those probes, and is central to President Trump’s effort to discredit Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.Reports last week indicated that House Judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte was preparing to subpoena Strzok as part of the House investigation into the FBI’s conduct during the 2016 election. Strzok’s lawyer, Aitan Goelman, said in a letter to Goodlatte released Sunday that the move would be unnecessary, as Strzok “intends to voluntarily appear and testify before your committee and any other Congressional committee that invites him.”The letter noted that Strzok cooperated fully with the DOJ inspector general, who issued a report last week that was highly critical of the agent. In the lead-up to the 2016 election Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who were having an affair, exchanged anti-Trump messages on their FBI-issued phones. In one, Page asked if Trump might become president and Strzok replied, “No. No he won’t. We’ll stop it.” The inspector general found no evidence connecting their views with “specific investigative decisions,” but said that comment and others “implies a willingness to take official action.”Strzok and Page said he meant Trump wouldn’t be elected, and noted that they did not do anything to hurt Trump’s odds, like leaking the existence of the Russia probe before the election. Goelman told the Washington Post on Sunday that there’s “no question” that Strzok regrets sending the messages, but that “I think what he was doing is expressing his political opinions in what he thought was a private text conversation, and he regrets that this has been weaponized by people with political motivations to try to discredit the Mueller investigation.”Mueller removed Strzok from his investigation several weeks after it started following the discovery of the texts.Goelman said that if asked to testify, Strzok would be willing to testify without immunity, and would not invoke his Fifth Amendment rights. He said the agent “intends to answer any question put to him, and he intends to defend the integrity of the Clinton email investigation, the Russia collusion investigation to the extent that that’s a topic, and his own integrity.”Trump reiterated his thoughts on the matter on Sunday night, which are not supported by the inspector general’s findings. The report did not cover the Russia probe, though that did not stop Trump’s allies from calling for Mueller’s immediate suspension.Why was the FBI’s sick loser, Peter Strzok, working on the totally discredited Mueller team of 13 Angry & Conflicted Democrats, when Strzok was giving Crooked Hillary a free pass yet telling his lover, lawyer Lisa Page, that “we’ll stop” Trump from becoming President?

Strzok's willingness to appear comes after months of speculation and accusations of political bias within the FBI and Department of Justice. The announcement offers a glimmer of hope for those seeking to understand the events leading up to the election and the subsequent investigations, which have been mired in controversy and confusion. For his part, Strzok seems determined to set the record straight and cooperate fully with the investigation. His testimony could shed light on some of the most pressing questions surrounding the Russia probe and provide a valuable perspective on the work of the FBI.

Until recently, she was fairly liberal, and a big supporter of Hillary Clinton.In a statement not long ago, Parton said she was inspired that a woman might be President for the first time in our nation’s history.“We’re doing good,” she commented at the time. “We got a woman that could go in the White House, so we’ve certainly come a long way in that respect.”Recently, Parton saw the light and realized that Hillary would be quite possible the worst person to be the champion for woman throughout the nation.

According to Parton, Trump’s first year as President has already surpassed 16 years’ worth of work done by former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama ""put together"", despite criticisms from ""stupid liberals"" who she believes are trying to impeach him.

Parton, known for hits such as ""Jolene"" and ""9 to 5"", is not shy about her support for the Republican party and has campaigned for Republican candidates in the past. However, her recent comments have sparked controversy and divided opinions among her fans.

While some may agree with Parton’s assessment of Trump’s success in office, others have criticized her for disregarding the accomplishments of previous Presidents, particularly Obama. Critics argue that Obama’s presidency brought about significant progress in areas such as healthcare, climate change, and LGBTQ rights.

Regardless of one’s political alignment, it is important to recognize the impact of all Presidents, past and present. As citizens, it is our duty to remain informed and engaged in the political process in order to create a brighter future for ourselves and future generations."
politifact14810,1,0,"Federal Judge Peter J. Messitte has just ruled in favor of two attorney generals seeking to subpoena the Trump organization relating to President Trump unlawfully receiving emoluments from foreign and domestic governments.D.C. Attorney General Karl A. Racine and Maryland Attorney General Brian E. Frosh can now subpoena the Trump organization, thereby forcing them to preserve documents in relation to President Trump’s alleged indiscretions.The case advances a very high-profile attempt to see if President Trump is violating the emoluments clause of the U.S. Constitution, which precludes him from receiving gifts from foreign or state governments. The Trump Organization will be compelled to comply with the court’s ruling.“This ruling is an important first step in our litigation against President Trump for unlawfully receiving emoluments from foreign and domestic governments,” Racine said in a statement.Per the Post:Because Trump continues to benefit financially from his hotel, resort and golf properties — in some cases from clients affiliated with foreign governments — Frosh and Racine alleged in their June complaint that Trump had committed “unprecedented constitutional violations.” State spending that benefits the president may be considered a violation of the domestic emolument clause, which says the president “shall not receive” any emolument, other than fixed compensation, from “the United States, or any of them.”The Justice Department had sought to squash the subpoena earlier in September, but Judge Messitte wasn’t convinced with their argument.President Trump has been accused of profiting from the presidency, and this case will seek to prove that assertion.","Washington D.C. - In a landmark decision, Federal Judge Peter J. Messitte has directed the Trump Organization to hand over financial documents, emails, and other records related to the emoluments clause of the United States Constitution. This ruling comes as a result of a lawsuit filed by two attorney generals, who argued that President Trump unlawfully profited from foreign and domestic governments while in office. 

The emoluments clause, a provision of the Constitution that prohibits federal officials from receiving gifts or payments from foreign governments, has been the subject of intense scrutiny since the election of President Trump. The lawsuit alleges that President Trump violated this clause by continuing to receive profits from his business ventures while in office. 

Judge Messitte found that the attorney generals had shown ""clear evidence"" that President Trump's continued involvement with the Trump Organization had resulted in financial benefits from foreign and domestic entities. As a result, the judge authorized the subpoenas sought by the attorney generals, mandating the production of financial documents and other records related to the Trump Organization's activities.

This ruling represents a significant victory for those who have long called for greater transparency and accountability from our elected officials. The decision sends a clear message that no one, not even the President of the United States, is above the law. 

As the legal process continues to unfold, many will be closely watching to see how the Trump Organization responds to this ruling. It remains to be seen whether the organization will comply with the subpoenas or seek to challenge the ruling in court. For now, however, the decision represents a crucial step forward in the fight for transparency and accountability in government."
politifact15492,1,0,"January 2nd, 2005, was a very important day in seven-year-old Katie Flynn’s life.She was one of the flower girls at her aunt Lisa’s wedding, along with her younger sister Grace.Over 200 friends and relatives had gathered on a beach in Long Island to witness Lisa and David exchange their vows and join in holy matrimony.The guests watched on as Katie and Grace walked down the isle with their beautiful dresses and innocent smiles – but nobody could have known this was to be the last day of young Katie’s life.After a long day of love, laughter and festivities, the bride’s parents, Christopher and Denice, along with her sister, Jennifer, Jennifer’s husband, Neil, and their two young daughters, Katie and Grace, got in the limousine that would take them home.“I remember looking in on the limo and seeing Kate and waving goodbye and she waved goodbye and never thought that was going to be the type of moment where you’re seeing people for the last time,” the groom, David, told CNN.The limousine left the Long Island wedding and joined the highway. They could never have known that a drunk 24-year-old, Marin Heidgen, was also on the road. Heidgen, driving on the wrong side of the road, hit the limo head-on, causing a devastating accident.Police reports revealed that Heidgen’s blood alcohol level was more than three times the legal limit. He had consumed at least 14 drinks and had been driving at 70 miles an hour, on the wrong side of the highway, for at least two miles before the catastrophic accident occurred.The driver of the limousine, 59-year-old Stanley Rabinowitz, was killed instantly after being crushed by the engine. The bride’s father, Christopher, broke both of his legs in several places after being thrown to the floor. He later had to have one amputated. His wife, Denise, was also seriously injured, and little Grace was stuck in the folds of the wreckage.Despite having a broken back, Neil attempted to crawl from the car to seek help. Meanwhile, Jennifer, who had injured her foot, was desperately searching for Katie, who had been lying on the side seat at the time of the crash.Then, Jennifer Flynn came across something that no mother should ever have to witness – her daughter, Katie, had been decapitated by her own seat-belt.One of the first responders on the scene was Michael Tangney, the bride’s uncle and a policeman himself. He had been at the wedding just hours before:“I was walking to the rear of the limousine when a gentleman was coming away from it, and he said, ‘Don’t go back there. It’s bad,’” Michael Tangney said. “I opened the rear door to the limousine and realized it was my family.”But, tragically, the worst was yet to come.Michael Tagney would witness Jennifer emerging from the wreck with her daughter’s head in her hands. Katie’s body remained in the car, still in the dress she had proudly worn for the wedding only a few hours previous.For the next hour, Jennifer sat next to the road. She kept Katie’s head on her lap and watched as the rest of her family was freed from the wreckage of the destroyed vehicle.Eventually, she let her daughter go; handing her to Michael. Before she did so, she kissed her daughter’s face one last time.The event altered the lives of the whole family. Martin Heidgen was sentenced to 18 years in prison for two counts of second-degree murder – though nothing, of course, can ever bring back Jennifer’s daughter.Jennifer and Neil have bravely chosen to talk openly about their story, in the hope that it might prevent a similar catastrophe from happening again.“Since no one should have to live the life I do, I felt a responsibility, an obligation, to stand up and tell our story,” Jennifer said.“I hope that by experiencing the devastation that we survived that night, and still continue to live through, people can see the seriousness of drunk driving as the crime it really is. Hopefully we will save more in the future.”The fact that people still drive drunk will come as no surprise to you.I’m sure y","On January 2nd, 2005, a seven-year-old girl named Katie Flynn experienced a significant moment in her life. She became a flower girl at her aunt Lisa's wedding, and her younger sister Grace accompanied her in this role.

Being chosen as a flower girl is a great honour in weddings and a cherished part of any child's memory.

politifact15494,1,0,"A dispute in Angela Merkel’s coalition over migration policy has swiftly escalated into one of the biggest tests of her chancellorship.The clash has opened a rift at the heart of the German leader’s own camp, between her Christian Democratic Union and its CSU Bavarian sister party. How the conflict is resolved will determine the chancellor’s fate, possibly as soon as Monday.Horst Seehofer, Merkel’s interior minister and the leader of Bavaria’s Christian Social Union, wants to force through a plan to send back migrants who have already registered for asylum in other European Union states. Merkel rejects the proposal as offloading the burden on neighboring states, and says it would kill efforts to forge a bloc-wide response to the continent’s struggle with migration.Bavarian lawmakers are fully behind Seehofer, while Merkel has wrested a majority in the larger CDU group for her position. The standoff is a replay of tensions that have periodically bubbled up between Merkel and Seehofer since the height of the refugee crisis in 2015 and 2016, only this time there is no obvious way out. Following are some potential scenarios:CompromiseThe two parties have managed to eke out a compromise after each previous conflict. Overtures could begin on Monday, when the CSU party executive meets in Munich. Seehofer could give Merkel what she wants: two weeks to forge bilateral accords with countries such as Italy and Greece to return registered asylum seekers.Merkel could also give ground, as for example the newspaper Die Welt advocates. She could put forward another proposal to assuage the CSU that may yield a compromise. But if she caves in to the Bavarian demands as they stand, it would be an unprecedented loss of authority that would render her a lame duck leader.No CompromiseIn the absence of a face-saving deal, the real clash could come as early as Monday. That’s when Seehofer has indicated he will start to implement his plan at the border. As interior minister, Seehofer has the authority to do so, even in the face of Merkel’s rejection. The only way for the chancellor to forestall a unilateral decision by her minister would be to fire him. Sacking her top Bavarian ally would be a historic first. If it happens, it’s hard to see how the coalition continues.Even if it doesn’t come to that and Merkel is given until the June 28-29 EU summit to reach bilateral agreements, it may only delayed the clash, since there is no guarantee she can win deals with other other EU states. She has already called the prospect ambitious.Confidence voteFor a coalition to dissolve, the German constitution says the lower house of parliament, or Bundestag, has to call a vote of confidence. The CDU and CSU, with a combined 246 seats, and the SPD with 153, have a majority of 44 seats in the 709-seat Bundestag. Such a move would be the ultimate measure of support for Merkel as chancellor. Even if she is unable to rely on the CSU, or indeed all of her own party’s votes, on the specific issue of her stand on migration Merkel might be able to attract the support of the Greens, which have 67 seats.Germany’s Sueddeutsche Zeitung said in an opinion piece on Friday that Merkel should short-circuit the squabbling and put her parliamentary support to the test with a confidence vote. It’s a tactic that her predecessor, Social Democrat Gerhard Schroeder, used to force through military support for the U.S. after the Sept. 11 attacks. He used it again in 2005 amid a party rebellion, and this time lost the confidence motion, forcing new elections.Merkel resignsShould the chancellor view her authority as irretrievably compromised, she could throw in the towel. The Bundestag would be forced to elect a new chancellor to replace her, most likely from the CDU. Unless the governing parties agree to continue the coalition under a new leader, Germany’s ninth chancellor since World War II would serve in a caretaker capacity through to a new election.Split on the rightThe CDU and the CSU ar","Berlin, Germany - A fierce dispute over migration policy in Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition government has rapidly become one of the most critical challenges of her chancellorship. The disagreement comes as a substantial blow to Merkel's continuous leadership in Germany as it threatens to destabilize her government and put her in a difficult political position.

The tension centers on Merkel's decision to allow in hundreds of thousands of refugees predominantly from Syria and Afghanistan in 2015, during the peak of Europe's refugee crisis. Horst Seehofer, her coalition partner and leader of the Christian Social Union party, has been vocal in his disagreement with this open-door policy, calling for tighter controls on immigration and a cap on the number of asylum-seekers allowed into the country.

Seehofer's hard-line stance has shaken the fragile coalition between Merkel's Christian Democratic Union and Seehofer's conservative party, with tensions escalating to the point where the three parties risk complete collapse. The stand-off has raised the risk of new elections in Germany, a threat that the country's leaders are desperately trying to avert.

The chancellor has strongly defended her immigration policy and has warned that closing the borders would lead to a loss of control both domestically and abroad. She has also cautioned that Germany's membership and influence in the European Union are at stake if the country adopts a more restrictive immigration policy.

Merkel's government now finds itself at a crucial crossroads, with the chancellor's firm beliefs on migration policy colliding sharply with Seehofer's uncompromising stance. As the two parties face off, all eyes are on Germany's political leadership as they navigate what could potentially be the end of an era."
politifact14814,1,0,"According to CNN, the former police chief of a small New Jersey town said African-Americans had “no value” and were “like ISIS,” and said he wanted to put them before a firing squad, and now the racist has been arrested.The FBI has arrested Frank Nucera Jr., who was the chief of Bordentown Township Police Department. They allege Nuncera referred to African-Americans using several racial slurs and told his officers to position police dogs at high school basketball games to specifically intimidate African-Americans.Nucera abruptly retired in February after he learned his use of racially motivated force was under investigation. He was making $151,418.31 per year. Nucera draws an annual pension of $105,992.76 — $8,832.73 per month — according to public records.Sixty-year-old Nucera is facing a hate crime charge and a federal civil rights charge. FBI Special Agent Vernon Addison wrote in an affidavit that Nucera “has a significant history of making racist comments concerning African Americans, to whom he frequently referred to as ‘n*ggers'”. One of Nucera’s officers “made numerous recordings” of Nucera that “contained extremely offensive racist comments” over the course of a year because he was “alarmed” by Nucera’s racism, according to the affidavit.The federal charges against Nucera relate to a Sept. 1, 2016, police encounter involving an 18-year-old African-American man and 16-year-old African-American girl. A hotel manager called police because he said the pair hadn’t paid for their hotel room the night before and were swimming in the hotel pool. The FBI affidavit states that their encounter with police “escalated into a physical struggle,” that both teens “resisted arrest” and that one of the officers used pepper spray.AdvertisementAfter both teens were handcuffed, Nucera grabbed the 18-year-old’s head and slammed it “into the right side of the metal doorjamb,” according to the affidavit. An officer heard the 18-year-old’s head make “a loud thud” as it hit the doorjamb, the feds alleged. Officers said the 18-year-old wasn’t resisting when Nucera slammed his head, but had “stopped walking for a moment to loudly complain.” The use of force wasn’t reported to the department.Hours after the assault, Nucera was recorded telling an officer he was “f*cking tired” of African-Americans.“I’ll tell you what, it’s gonna get to the point where I could shoot one of these motherfuckers,” Nucera allegedly said. “And that n*ggerr bitch lady, she almost got it,” he said, referring to the 16-year-old girl’s aunt, who was present at the arrest. “Fucking nipple hanging bitch. I’m so tired of them, man.”Nucera allegedly said that black people should “stay the fuck out of Bordentown” and referred to the 18-year-old as “fucking little, fucking n****r.”In a separate incident noted in the report that occurred in November 2015, Nucera said he wished an African-American from Trenton who he believed had slashed the tires of a police vehicle would give him a reason to “put my hands” on him.“These n****rs are like ISIS, they have no value,” Nucera allegedly said. “They should line them all up and mow ’em down. I’d like to be on the firing squad, I could do it. I used to think about if I could shoot someone or not, I could do it, I’m tired of it.”“The conduct alleged is shocking,” acting US Attorney William E. Fitzpatrick said at a news conference.“It’s a shocking breach of the duty of every police officer to provide equal justice under the law and to never mistreat a person in their custody.”AdvertisementNucera appeared in court Wednesday afternoon in Camden, NJ, and waived his right to a preliminary hearing. He was released on a bail of $500,000.","The former police chief of a small New Jersey town has been arrested after making racially charged remarks, as reported by CNN. The former chief, whose name has not been released yet, had reportedly made derogatory comments regarding African-Americans, stating that they had ""no value"" and that they were ""like ISIS."" He had even gone so far as to express his desire to put them before a firing squad. These comments were a clear indication of the deeply ingrained racism that still plagues our society today.

Fortunately, the former police chief's vile words did not go unnoticed. His arrest sends a strong message that such behavior will not be tolerated, and that justice will be served to those who espouse hate. This incident highlights the importance of speaking out against racism and bigotry in all its forms, and of holding those who perpetrate such acts accountable for their actions. It is our collective responsibility to create a fair and just society where hatred and intolerance have no place."

Aunque hay que ver, pues muchas veces le ponen cosas en los mismos aeropuertos en las maletas y a pasado. Veremos que dira ella mas tarde, pero sera horrible en otro pais y en una carcel ️","In a shocking revelation, it has been discovered that travelers are often subjected to deception and fraud while traveling through airports. The recent reports suggest that many unsuspecting travelers are lured into buying fake items that are presented as luxurious and expensive, only to find out later that they have been cheated.

This issue has been going on for quite some time now, and a lot of people are falling prey to this scam. The travelers are often promised high-end products at a fraction of the cost and are convinced to make the purchase on the spot. However, upon further inspection, it is revealed that these products are counterfeits, and the traveler has been duped into buying a worthless item.

What's even more worrisome is the fact that some passengers have found strange objects or substances in their luggage after traveling through the airport. This has raised concerns over the safety and security of the baggage scanning process in the airports, and brought into question the measures taken by the airport authorities to prevent such incidents.

Even though the airport authorities claim to have strict security measures in place, it seems like the passengers are still falling victim to such fraudulent practices. It's high time the airport authorities take affirmative action to ensure the safety and security of their travelers, and put an end to these unethical practices once and for all.

The travelers deserve to be treated with respect and honesty, and it's up to the airport authorities to ensure that their travel experience is not marred by any form of deception or fraud. It's imperative that they take a proactive approach to tackle this issue and implement measures to mitigate the risks faced by the travelers."

Now, they’re screwed.The answer, naturally, is a resounding no. Democrats will do anything to undermine the president’s work. That includes being underhanded, manipulative, and cruel as possible.Within the course of Trump’s period in office, we have seen liberals do some shockingly dreadful things. They’ve insulted his wife by criticizing her intelligence, state of origin, as well as her accent, demonstrating who the real racists and sexists are.Liberals didn’t hesitate to question his children’s psychological health, even calling Barron handicapped. That is not even mentioning the numerous times that left handed outlets edited videos or photos to create Trump look like a poor guy.However, what they did that this weekend actually takes the cake. A photo went viral throughout Twitter. The dreadful picture depicted arrested illegal immigrants. These individuals — arrested by our government — were made to stay in cages resembling dog kennels.It is too bad that these liberals did not bother to check the date on the film.Ex-Obama staffer Jon Favreau, in a now-deleted conversation, linked to a AZCentral.com article titled,”First glance of immigrant kids at holding facility” and said”This is occurring right now, and the only argument that issue is the way we force our government to get these kids back to their families as quickly as possible”His obvious intent was to slam the Trump government for its treatment of unaccompanied minors taken into custody at the border.

As stated by the date, this was composed in 2014.That’s right, liberals.

They were not calling Obama racist for treating kids like this.

Yet they accuse Trump of racism, dependent on nothing. All Trump wants to do is protect our border from crime and terrorism.He is not treating illegals like creatures.

This has sparked a wave of outrage among some people who seek to use the images as evidence of the Trump administration’s supposed harshness toward illegal immigrants.

The images depict a group of people, allegedly illegal immigrants, detained in cells that resemble cages. While the source of these pictures is unclear, reports suggest that they were taken at an undisclosed location along the southern border.

Certain members of the left-leaning media and progressive politicians have been quick to point to these photographs as evidence of the Trump administration's heartlessness. They argue that the country has a moral duty to provide better care to those trying to cross over illegally.

However, critics have pointed out that the cages have been used by previous administrations, and the Trump Administration is making significant efforts to alter the system, which has been mired in controversy for decades.

Nonetheless, the images have intensified the immigration debate in the US. While some people are raising concerns about the conditions in these detention centers, others point out that the pictures do not necessarily tell the whole story.

Regardless of the circumstances behind these photos, the controversy that they have provoked only further confirms the contentious nature of the immigration debate in the US. There is no doubt that this matter will continue to play a pivotal role in the upcoming 2020 presidential campaign."

However, what is surprising is the exorbitant price tag on the bottle of water - $7. This has left many wondering how the foundation can get away with charging such an exorbitant price for a basic necessity in a time of crisis.

The foundation, which claims to be dedicated to improving the lives of people around the world, has come under severe criticism for its pricing strategy. The water bottles, which are being distributed in Houston, are being sold at a price that is more than three times the average price of bottled water in the United States.

The question that arises is how a charitable foundation, which relies on donations from people across the globe, can justify such a high price for a basic necessity. The foundation has not provided any explanation for the pricing strategy, leaving many to speculate about the motives behind such a seemingly heartless move.

In a time when people are coming together to help those in need, it is disheartening to see an organization like the Clinton Foundation profiting off the misfortune of others.

Some supporters of the student argue that his decision constitutes a legitimate exercise of individual freedom and critical thinking, while others claim that it shows a lack of empathy and concern for the issue of gun violence.

politifact15210,1,0,"320 SHARES Share TweetPresident Trump is about to end the longstanding abuse of the American welfare system and ban migrants from getting free money and handouts for five years. The immigration rules will prohibit migrants from coming to the country and taking advantage of free American welfare money right away. It will slow down, or stop, chain migration while protecting American workers and potentially saving taxpayers money.What used to happen is that people would migrate to America and just live on the free money they received. That’s called welfare abuse. America is open to migrants, but perhaps we don’t want migrants who can’t fend for themselves. Maybe it’s better if people who are self-sufficient migrate to the country so that we can reduce the amount of citizens living off the system.President Trump wants to introduce a merit-based Green card system in which migrants compete for Visas. Migrants can earn points for themselves by learning to speak English, gaining job training or job offers, or doing something else that is considered a benefit to the America. The idea seems to be that in order for America to grant Visas or citizenship, the migrant has to give something back to the country. It’s as though the government wants to stop people coming to America and living off the system and would prefer people coming to the country to be contributors. Do something for America and America will do something for you.Migrants to those countries must compete for a limited number of visas by gaining points for English proficiency, competitive training, a job offer or another major achievement that benefits the host country.The concept, which is modeled after similar programs from Australia and Canada, is taking harsh criticism from activists. It’s like they want an open border policy where everyone gets free welfare money, but that would just be the downfall of America. If we observe what’s happening in Germany, with Merkel’s “come on in” policy, then we see a mass increase in horrible crimes like gang rape. Do we want mass amounts of migrant gang rape in America? There’s already enough trouble with crime in sanctuary cities that protect illegal immigrant criminals. Those folks should be deported because of their bad behavior and often violent crimes they commit on American people and even other immigrants.If America prevents immigrants from getting free benefits for five years, then that makes people think twice about coming here. If a family who thinks about crossing the border to start a new life knows that they cannot live for free, then they may not come at all. If they have possible jobs lined up and will be almost instantly integrating successfully with society, then that’s a great match. America is the land of the free, but not the land of the free money.Migrants who enter the United States cannot receive welfare during their first five years in the country, President Trump revealed from his upcoming immigration overhaul.“Just this week, we announced a historic immigration bill to create a merit-based Green Card system that ends the abuse of our welfare system, stops chain migration, and protects our workers and our economy,” he stated on his weekly radio address. “As an example, you cannot get welfare for five years when you come into our country.”“You cannot just come in like in past weeks, years, and decades, you come in immediately and start picking up welfare. For five years, you have to say you will not be asking or using our welfare systems.”Compare that to Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel opened the border to millions of unvetted migrants who can’t speak German and lack employable skills, which dooms them to perpetual welfare paid by German taxpayers – and boredom that manifests into terrorist attacks against, once again, German taxpayers.Last year the German government admitted that only 2.8% of over 1.2 million migrants had gotten a job – but even then those statistics might be exaggerated, according to j","Washington D.C. - President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that will put an end to the abuse of America's welfare system. The order bans migrants from obtaining free money and handouts for five years.

For far too long, the United States has been the destination for people seeking financial aid from the government. This has resulted in a tremendous burden on the country's economy, with hardworking taxpayers being forced to bear the brunt of the situation. But the days of such abuse are coming to an end with President Trump's latest move.

The executive order will prevent migrants from receiving federal benefits for a period of five years from their date of entry into the country. The move promotes financial responsibility and encourages self-sufficiency among immigrants.

""The welfare system is meant to provide a temporary safety net for people in need, not a long-term solution. We want to encourage people who come to this great nation to be self-sufficient and contribute to the economy,"" President Trump said in a statement.

This order will be a significant boost to America's economy, as fewer people will rely on government aid as a source of income. It will also benefit the American people, especially hardworking taxpayers, who have long awaited a fair and just system.

In conclusion, President Trump's executive order is a significant step in the right direction, as it will help put an end to the long-standing abuse of America's welfare system. It is a crucial move that will promote financial responsibility and encourage self-sufficiency among immigrants while creating a fair and just system for all."

Student organizers from Never Again MSD planned the march in collaboration with the nonprofit organization Everytown for Gun Safety. The event followed the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, which was described by many media outlets as a possible tipping point for gun control legislation.Never Again MSD (MSD refers to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School) is a group started on social media as a movement “For survivors of the Stoneman Douglas Shooting, by survivors of the Stoneman Douglas Shooting” using the hashtag #NeverAgain.The MSD student survivors who formed Never Again MSD include the now-famous David Hogg, Emma Gonzalez, and Cameron Kasky.Public demonstrations, especially those that are large-scale like March For Our Lives, require a permit from the police department of the city in which the demonstration will take place.A source of European researcher Ole Dammegard contacted the Metropolitan D.C.

The marches drew massive crowds of people from all walks of life, including students, parents, and concerned citizens who support the goal of stopping gun violence.

politifact14506,1,0,"A staggering 30,000 scientists have come forward confirming that man-made climate change is a hoax perpetuated by the elite in order to make money.One of the experts is weather channel founder, John Coleman, who warns that huge fortunes are being made by man-made climate change proponents such as Al Gore.Natural News reports:In a recent interview with Climate Depot, Coleman said:“Al Gore may emerge from the shadows to declare victory in the ‘global warming’ debate if Hillary Clinton moves into the White House. Yes, if that happens and the new climate regulations become the law of the land, they will be next to impossible to overturn for four to eight years.”Climate change proponents remain undeterred in their mission, ignoring numerous recent scientific findings indicating that there has been no warming trend at all for nearly two decades.Al Gore’s dire predictions of the melting of polar ice on a massive scale have proved to be completely false. In fact, in 2014 – a year that was touted as being “the hottest ever” in the Earth’s history – there were record amounts of ice reported in Antarctica, an increase in Arctic ice, and record snowfalls across the globe.Debunking the “97 percent” lieOn top of those “inconvenient truths,” the White House’s assertion that 97 percent of scientists agree that global warming is real has been completely debunked. Several independently-researched examinations of the literature used to support the “97 percent” statement found that the conclusions were cherry-picked and misleading.More objective surveys have revealed that there is a far greater diversity of opinion among scientists than the global warming crowd would like for you to believe.From the National Review:“A 2008 survey by two German scientists, Dennis Bray and Hans von Storch, found that a significant number of scientists were skeptical of the ability of existing global climate models to accurately predict global temperatures, precipitation, sea-level changes, or extreme weather events even over a decade; they were far more skeptical as the time horizon increased.”Other mainstream news sources besides the National Review have also been courageous enough to speak out against the global warming propaganda – even the Wall Street Journal published an op-ed piece in 2015 challenging the Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) pseudoscience being promulgated by global warming proponents.And, of course, there are the more than 31,000 American scientists (to date) who have signed a petition challenging the climate change narrative and 9,029 of them hold PhDs in their respective fields. But hey, Al Gore and his cronies have also ignored that inconvenient truth, as well.Many of those scientists who signed the petition were likely encouraged to speak out in favor of the truth after retired senior NASA atmospheric scientist John L. Casey revealed that solar cycles are largely responsible for warming periods on Earth – not human activity.Al Gore and cronies continue getting richer from the global warming hoaxBut the global warming crowd continues to push their agenda on the public while lining their pockets in the process. If you’re still inclined to believe what Al Gore has to say about global warming, please consider the fact that since he embarked on his crusade, his wealth has grown from $2 million in 2001 to $100 million in 2016 – largely due to investments in fake “green tech” companies and the effective embezzlement of numerous grants and loans.You might want to take all of this information into serious consideration before casting your vote in the November election.","In a shocking revelation, a massive number of 30,000 scientists has risen to declare that the concept of man-made climate change is nothing but a hoax, fabricated by the rich and powerful to amass more wealth. The claim came into the light after a joint session of the scientists, who represented diverse fields and countries, further adding to its credibility.

The scientists emphasized that the evidence provided by authorities and media regarding global warming failed to present a reliable correlation, as stated by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and instead relied on manipulated data and hypothesis. Moreover, the researchers underlined that the record-low temperatures and the evident reduction of increased CO2 emissions in recent years are evidence that supports the flawed foundations of man-made climate change.

It is clear from this shocking announcement that the world has been misled about climate change, and it is time to reevaluate the current narrative, according to experts. The notion of carbon taxes and climate change treaties could impose tremendous challenges for the economic development of nations, therefore, it is the responsibility of lawmakers to understand the gravity of the situation and initiate corrective measures.

The scientific community's stance proves that they are willing to stand up to their convictions, even if it means going against the prevalent narrative. It is an initiative to put science's integrity above all and provide a rational sense of discipline in any domains. It is imperative that policymakers take note of this dissenting science to initiate comprehensive research that values evidence over mere assumptions. The goal of unveiling truth and promoting transparency should be the drive in any change of policy regarding climate."

The actor, the president, and climate scientist Dr. Katharine Hayhoe took the stage towards the end of the evening for a conversation on climate change before the U.S. premiere of DiCaprio’s new documentary on the subject, Before the Flood.The subject of Mars and SpaceX came up while Hayhoe was talking about the need to make people connect with the reality of climate change on a universal, human level. “The most important thing to do is not to pile up scientific reports until they reach a tottering pile of about 8 feet where they tip over and crush somebody,” Hayhoe said, explaining that what really matters when trying to motivate people to combat climate change thing is to connect its real meaning and impact to “what’s in our hearts.”“The reality of it is, if you’re a human living on this planet — which most of us are, yeah?” she joked. “As long as we haven’t signed up for the trip to Mars.

The star has already accomplished a myriad of impressive feats including solo sailing on the Titanic, battling ferocious grizzly bears in the treacherous Wild West, and exploring the subconscious mind. However, his next mission is set to take him further than ever before – to the red planet itself.

While there are several projects currently underway to launch human missions to Mars, none have specified who the eventual colonists will be. However, DiCaprio has revealed that he is working with a team of scientists and engineers to make his dream a reality. The 41-year-old actor is advocating for humanity to become a multi-planetary species, stating that it is ""essential for the preservation and continuance of our species"".

Mars has become an increasingly popular destination in the last few years, with several private enterprises as well as national space organizations such as NASA announcing plans to reach the planet.

Disturbingly, the fate of many of these children, mostly migrants, remains unknown.NY Mag reports: Local law enforcement uncovered the operation last year, prompting the Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations to open an inquiry into the federal government’s handling of migrants.“It is intolerable that human trafficking — modern-day slavery — could occur in our own backyard,” Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio and the chairman of the subcommittee, told the New York Times. “But what makes the Marion cases even more alarming is that a U.S. government agency was responsible for delivering some of the victims into the hands of their abusers.”As detention centers became incapable of housing the massive influx of migrants, the Department of Health and Human Services started placing children into the care of sponsors who would oversee the minors until their bids for refugee status could be reviewed. But in many cases, officials failed to confirm whether the adults volunteering for this task were actually relatives or good Samaritans — and not unscrupulous egg farmers or child molesters.The department performed check-in visits at caretakers’ homes in only 5 percent of cases between 2013 and 2015, according to the report.The Senate’s investigation built on an Associated Press report that found more than two dozen unaccompanied children were placed in homes where they were sexually abused, starved, or forced into slave labor. HHS claimed that it lacked the funds and authorities that a more rigorous screening process would have required.However, the investigation also found that HHS did not spend all of the money allocated to it for handling the crisis.The agency placed 90,000 migrant children into sponsor care between 2013 and 2015.

The report claims that this information was completely covered up by mainstream media.

The report, which is the result of a three-year investigation into the State Department's handling of child trafficking cases, has uncovered disturbing details about the handling of vulnerable children. The report states that during Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State, the department completely failed to carry out the most basic checks on the alleged ""caregivers"" who were responsible for looking after these children.

According to the report, this failure enabled human traffickers to take advantage of the situation and take these children, potentially putting them in danger. The report notes that this information was not released due to the cover-up by mainstream media.

The Senate report's findings have raised deep concern among child protection agencies and advocates who are calling for action to be taken to ensure such blatant disregard for the safety of children never happens again. The report's details and the media blackout surrounding it have raised serious questions about the role of mainstream media in reporting such stories.

General George Mason’s assistant Chief of Staff all but confirmed the report, saying that the matter has been turned over to those in charge of accountability. She hinted that this is exactly the kind of thing that could end up before Congress:“This was a huge violation of the public trust, not to mention an incredibly bold theft from the US taxpayer.

The missing ammunition had been a cause for concern for many years, with allegations of it being used by criminal or extremist groups. However, the report has now confirmed that it was indeed a case of unaccounted ammunition that has now been rectified by the diligent efforts of US forces.

The return of the ammunition is a significant development, as it ensures the safety and security of the country and its citizens.

politifact14700,1,0,"Congresswoman Maxine Waters has reignited her political career as one of the most outspoken leaders of the Trump “Resistance.” She regularly and often beats the drum of impeachment for the president. However, in August of 2010, it was Waters who was under legal scrutiny for her behavior as a government official. Waters was charged with three counts of violating House rules and the federal ethics code.According to The Hill’s report from 2010:The House ethics committee on Monday outlined its charges against Rep. Maxine Waters, who is accused of helping a bank in which her husband owned stock secure federal bailout funds. The committee charged the 10-term California Democrat with three counts of violating House rules and the federal ethics code in connection with her effort to arrange a 2008 meeting between Treasury officials and representatives with OneUnited bank. The panel said Waters, who sits on the Financial Services Committee, broke a House rule requiring members to behave in a way that reflects “creditably” on the chamber. The committee said that by trying to assist OneUnited, she stood to benefit directly, because her husband owned a sizable amount of stock that would have been “worthless” if the bank failed. The committee also accused Waters of violating the “spirit” of a House rule prohibiting lawmakers from using their positions for financial gain, as well as a government ethics statute banning the dispensing of “special favors.”The charges were delayed and stalled by members of the committee, and multiple attorneys in the case were fired. Ultimately, Waters was absolved of the charges.According to National Review:[Waters] walked away with a slap on the wrist from the toothless House Ethics Committee in 2012 after being charged with multiple ethics violations related to her meddling in minority-owned OneUnited Bank … As stockholders, they profited handsomely from their relationship with the bank. It was a mutually beneficial relationship. After Waters’s office personally intervened and lobbied the Treasury Department in 2008, OneUnited received $12 million in federal TARP bailout money — despite another government agency concluding that the bank operated “without effective underwriting standards” and engaged “in speculative investment practices. After the federal bailout of Fannie/Freddie, OneUnited’s stock in the government-sponsored enterprises plunged to a value estimated at less than $5 million. Only through Waters’s intervention was OneUnited able to secure an emergency meeting with the Treasury and then-Secretary Henry Paulson. Tom Fitton, Judicial Watch president, reported that Waters’s friend and fellow California Democratic congresswoman Zoe Lofgren helped delay Waters’s scheduled 2010 House ethics trial on the matter by stalling subpoenas and improperly firing two attorneys working on the investigation. Six of ten House Ethics panel members quit the case in 2012 over questions about their partiality. An outside investigator absolved Waters of any wrongdoing. In spite of getting off on the charges, Waters carries with her a terrible reputation for corruption. Please see this list for a rundown of all the numerous scandals and charges which have been brought against her. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington has listed her as one of the most corrupt members of Congress five times. Resist.","In a time when partisan tensions are high and the country is grappling with a global pandemic, Congresswoman Maxine Waters has emerged as a strong and vocal leader of the Trump ""Resistance."" As a longstanding member of Congress, Waters has been a force to be reckoned with, always fighting for what she believes is right, and never afraid to stand up against those who seek to undermine the democratic values she holds dear.

Recently, Waters has once again taken up the mantle of resistance, using her platform to call for the impeachment of President Donald Trump. Despite facing backlash and criticism from some corners, Waters has remained steadfast in her belief that the president's actions merit his removal from office.

For many, Waters is a symbol of hope and courage, someone who is willing to speak truth to power even in the face of opposition. Her ability to mobilize others has been instrumental in the fight against the Trump administration, and her unwavering commitment to justice and equality has inspired countless individuals across the country.

As we navigate these turbulent times, it is clear that Congresswoman Maxine Waters is a voice we need now more than ever. Her strength, resilience, and determination continue to inspire us all, and we can only hope that she will continue to lead us forward on the path towards progress and change."

Events were included in this list because of the seriousness or frequency of reporting. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequencies or to establish a causal relationship to components of Tripedia vaccine.In this sense, it should be noted that:Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Concentrates (For Further Manufacturing Use) are produced by The Research Foundation for Microbial Diseases of Osaka University (BIKEN), Osaka, Japan, under United States (US) license, and are combined with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur Inc.

The online Biologics Blood Vaccines document published by the FDA reveals that a major vaccine manufacturer has admitted on their package insert that their product may lead to autism as one of the many harmful reactions.

The revelation is expected to have significant implications for the medical community, especially parents who have been grappling with autism in their children. The question of whether vaccinations cause autism has been a contentious one for years, with many people expressing concern about the alleged link between the two. Now, it appears that the evidence is mounting towards a possible connection.

The FDA’s discovery comes as a surprise, as public health experts have long contended that there is no credible evidence to support the claim that vaccines cause autism. However, this admission by a vaccine manufacturer could change the conversation around vaccinations and their side effects.

With this new information, medical practitioners and parents alike must reconsider their approach to vaccinations and take necessary precautions to protect children from potential adverse reactions. The FDA is urging parents to consult with their healthcare providers before deciding whether to vaccinate their children, as well as to carefully monitor them for any symptoms of adverse reactions.

The medical community is currently studying the link between vaccinations and autism and the recent discovery by the FDA is expected to spark further research into the issue. The FDA’s Biologics Blood Vaccines document is available online to all members of the public, offering greater transparency in the debate over vaccinations and their effects."
politifact13559,1,0,"Mike Pence said he didn’t understand why Michelle Obama had so passionately condemned his running mate, Donald Trump, for boasting about forcibly grabbing women by their genitals. The First Lady denounced the Republican presidential nominee, although she never dismissively spoke his name, for “speaking freely and openly about sexually predatory behavior” – which she said had “shaken (her) to the core.”“First and foremost,” Pence argued, “I have no idea why Mrs. Obama, who will be departing the White House shortly, is even commenting on the future President of the United States, God-willing. That’s the first thing I don’t quite get. Secondly, if she’s the First Lady, shouldn’t she be focused on doing whatever it is that First Ladies are supposed to be doing as their duties while their husbands are rescuing the world? What’s she doing commenting on and obviously worrying about her successor? That’s not what she should be doing.”The governor of Indiana also said that she “has no business” commenting on men and their “restroom talk,” as well as that that’s not “ladylike behavior.” “Now, I know that the word ‘lady’ is kind of in her job description, but it looks to me she’s not behaving like one, at least as of late,” he said. “If she was a real lady, she wouldn’t be commenting on men’s restroom talk and neglecting her own work and duties just so she could get a word out on a topic that she finds interesting for some reason.”He continued, “If we had anyone else serving as the first lady, they would pretend like they hadn’t heard it and would be going about their business in a normal fashion. But no, Michelle Obama is so vulgar she’s not only being vocal about it, but she’s also convinced that her job title will add weight and significance to her words. And she may be fooling those who can’t see through her smoke screen, but the rest of us have her figured out. She can’t fool me, just like she can’t fool Donald Trump or any other conservative American who has the guts to think for himself.”“How many times do I have to repeat the fact that what he did and the language he used was just restroom talk?” Pence asked. “He has apologized for it several times, and I really don’t know what else people want him to do. And now you have countless media outlets spearheaded by the New York Times who are calling Donald a sexual predator. And as if that wasn’t enough, the first lady also thinks she’s ordinary enough to be commenting on the issue as well. That’s just ridiculous.”“There is no way in hell Michelle Obama isn’t working with the New York Times in a joint effort to smear the good name of Donald Trump, if you ask me. I refuse to believe all of these women who are popping up out of nowhere with stories that Donald Trump had sexually assaulted them are a random occurrence. This is too well organized to be an accident. And the entire Democratic Party is behind it, with the addition of their latest recruit, the soon-to-be ex-first lady Michelle Obama. And I’m actually glad that’s the case because when Donald wins, we’ll offer all of them a job just for the fun of it,” Pence concluded.","Washington D.C., United States - The United States Vice President, Mike Pence, expressed his disappointment towards Michelle Obama's condemning remark about his running mate, Donald Trump. In an interview with CNN, Pence questioned the reason behind the former First Lady's passion, referring to Trump's boastful talk about forcibly grabbing women by their genitals as a mere 'locker room talk.'

Pence further stated that Michelle Obama's criticism of Trump's comments was unfair, as it seemed to disregard the crucial issues at hand, such as the economy, national security, healthcare, and foreign policy. He also emphasized that Trump had apologized for his remarks and acknowledged his mistakes.

The Vice President has shown consistent support towards the President, throughout his term, and has been actively involved in promoting his policies, often defending him from criticism. Pence stated that while he understands there may be disagreements among politicians, he believes that it is necessary to focus on the country's priorities and work towards achieving a better future for all Americans.

Pence's remarks come as the United States faces a crucial election season, with both the Republican and Democratic parties gearing up for a fierce contest. The country is grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic, economic downturn, and social unrest. The President and his administration have been subject to scrutiny for their response to these issues, and the upcoming elections may prove to be a turning point for the nation.

As the race heats up, both parties and their candidates are expected to engage in more heated debates, and it remains to be seen how each one will respond to criticism. However, Pence's firm stance towards Michelle Obama's comments highlights the Republican Party's strategy to defend its candidate vigorously."
politifact14742,1,0,"Giant Squid Washes Ashore on Lake Michigan Michigan DNR were called to Leland to the report of a giant squid which had washed ashore. Michigan DNR Marine Biologist Dr. Debra Polowotski arrived at Good Harbor Bay and confirmed the 21 foot-long giant squid to be a very rare fresh-water species of genus Architeuthis. “We thought they were already in Lake Erie, we had no idea they were in Lake Michigan. This is first time there’s been an actual specimen recovered, so this is very exciting”, she said. It is believed that a few of the squid escaped from the Cleveland Sea World complex during the great Northeast blackout of 2003 when they were very young, and somehow made it into Lake Erie. According to Dr. Polowotski, the squid were kept contained in Lake Erie, as the Detroit River is too narrow and shallow for the squid to swim upstream. “They are intimidated by closed-in spaces. They need a lot of room. You have to remember that this is a very big animal”, she said. Dr. Polotwotski also confirmed that the squid is a female and further examination of the corpse indicated that it had recently laid eggs. “Hopefully the walleye can keep the tiny-giant squid population under control, else there is some cause for concern”, said Dr. Polowotski. “Boaters and swimmers really need to exercise some caution”. The animal was discovered by Bob Ritchie and his sister Jill, both of Romeo. “We were just, you know, taking an evening walk along the beach, heading out to the sandbar when we stumbled across it”, said Bob. “We were singing, drinking whiskey out of the bottle, not thinking about tomorrow. But something like this really does make you stop and think”, he said. DNR officials removed the animal from the beach and took it to an undisclosed location for further study.","Leland, Michigan - The Michigan Department of Natural Resources (DNR) was called to Leland today to investigate an unusual creature that washed ashore on Lake Michigan. According to the report, a massive squid, measuring over 10 feet in length, was found by a local resident who was taking a morning stroll along the shore.

The discovery has caused quite a stir among the scientific community, as it is not common to find giant squids in freshwater lakes. The DNR team, led by marine biologist Dr. Lisa Brown, took samples from the creature for analysis and conducted a thorough examination of the area.

Dr. Brown stated that finding a giant squid in Lake Michigan is a rare phenomenon and is currently under investigation. The DNR team is trying to determine how the squid ended up in the lake, as it is not a native species to the area.

The discovery of the giant squid has also raised concerns about the health of Lake Michigan and its ecosystem. The DNR will continue to monitor the area and conduct further investigations to ensure the lake's safety.

In the meantime, locals are advised to avoid the area where the giant squid was found and to report any unusual sightings to the Michigan DNR. The discovery of this rare creature has provided invaluable insights into the natural world and has highlighted the importance of protecting our environment."

Reports have emerged that Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, were seen boarding a private jet bound for Lviv, Ukraine, on Friday night.

Clinton, a controversial figure in American politics, has long been the target of scrutiny and speculation from both sides of the political spectrum. Her sudden departure from the country has sparked a wave of questions and conspiracy theories.

Many have speculated that Clinton's departure is an attempt to avoid the fallout from the Mueller indictment, which has already rocked the political world. Some have even gone so far as to suggest that Clinton may be seeking asylum in Ukraine, or that she is attempting to flee potential legal consequences.

At this time, the reasons for Clinton's departure remain unclear. However, sources close to the former Secretary of State have stated that the trip was planned well in advance and that it is unrelated to recent events in American politics.

Regardless of the motivations behind Clinton's departure, it is clear that her absence will be felt in the coming weeks and months. As the political landscape continues to shift, the spotlight will inevitably return to Clinton and her place in American politics."

This fake dossier was then passed to James Comey at the FBI, who then issued FISA warrants to surveillance Donald Trump at the Trump Tower prior to the election, which later sparked Robert Mueller’s Special Counsel to investigate any Russian collusion in the 2016 Presidential Election. This, in a nutshell, exposes the spying and the treason that the DNC committed under the Obama administration to try to prevent Trump from succeeding, which is all stated in the Nunes Memo.Denzel affirmed, “If the Democrats had won the election, we never would have found out they were using false documents to get warrants to spy on American citizens and political opponents.

These revelations have sent shockwaves across the political landscape and have brought into question the very foundations of democracy. It is imperative that the authorities take swift action to hold those responsible accountable for their actions. The American people deserve the truth and justice, and it is the responsibility of the press to ensure that it is delivered."

The operation was carried out by a joint task force of US special forces and the Iraqi military, who successfully raided Muhammad's hideout in a remote region of the country.

The news came as a shock to many Americans, who have long been concerned about the threat posed by ISIS. Muhammad is known to have played a key role in the group's operations, and his capture is a major victory for the coalition forces fighting against extremist groups in the region.

Speaking about the operation, a spokesperson for the White House praised the bravery and skill of those involved in the raid, and hailed it as a clear demonstration of the government's commitment to keeping America safe. They also reiterated the importance of international cooperation in the fight against terrorism.

Meanwhile, leaders from around the world have expressed their support for the operation, with many taking to social media to congratulate the United States and its allies on this important achievement.

Now they have come out in force against what they describe as an ""elaborately orchestrated hoax"" by the Americans to fool the world about their space program capabilities.

As a show of support for their stance, over 200 high-ranking officials from the Chinese Space Program have signed a petition calling on the US government to release classified NASA information that the officials believe would prove that the moon landings were a complete fabrication.

The Chinese Space Program officials are not alone in their doubts about the American moon landings. Conspiracy theories surrounding the 1969 Apollo 11 moon landing have been around for decades and have been dismissed by many as baseless allegations.

However, the concerns raised by the Chinese officials add credibility to conspiracy theories and have caused the world to ask questions of America's moon landing achievements.

The US government has yet to respond to the petition, and there is no confirmation of any classified information that could vindicate the claims of the Chinese officials. For now, the world is left to ponder the legitimacy of America's most celebrated space achievement."

Not only are portions of Michigan being transformed into a “mini Baghdad,” but the state is also being overrun with rampant illegal activity, where the Muslim populace is constantly being busted in welfare fraud and disgusting mutilation practices on little girls. Now thanks to the hordes of Muslims taking over the state, Michigan can add another “accomplishment” on their list, as the Justice Department is dubbing what just went down in this state the “largest scam in United States history.”Muslims continually prove that they have little intentions into assimilating into western civilization or adhering to our nation’s laws after arriving to America from their third world countries. Our generosity to these savages is frequently repaid by insolence, as many Muslims are constantly busted at the center of welfare fraud rings, as they seek to scam the very country who has given them so much. In yet another case of blatant disregard for for our nation’s laws, a group of Muslim doctors in Detroit have just been busted as the masterminds behind a $1.3 billion dollar fraudulent scheme, leading to the arrests of 412 people overnight, in the “largest scam” that the United States Department of Justice has ever seen.The scam involves a scheme where Muslim doctors will write massive quantities of prescriptions for opioids. These drugs never land in the hands of patients however, as the Muslims will them make fraudulent claims to Medicaid and pocket the money. Additionally, the drugs often wind of on the streets as part of a huge back-alley drug operation. The U.S. Justice Department is calling this prescription drug and health care fraud scheme the largest operation of its kind in American history, naming several Michigan Muslim doctors responsible for orchestrating this huge criminal enterprise to rip off Medicare. ClickonDetroit.com has more:“Officials have made 412 arrests nationwide, including 56 doctors and targeting 200 clinics. The Justice Department said those arrested are responsible for $1.3 billion in fraudulent transactions.Federal officials said a group of Michigan doctors was responsible for a major chunk of the scheme.One of the clinics hit in the sting operations is in Farmington. Federal officials said the opioid epidemic is part of it, but the medical office and a number of others were set up specifically as a criminal enterprise to rip off Medicare.Federal officers raided the Fisher Building Wednesday, and U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said their work accounted for 10 percent of the scam’s value.‘Six doctors in Michigan prescribed patients with unnecessary opioids, some of which ended up for sale on the streets,’ Sessions said.A physician group called Global Quality used to operate out of a Woodward Avenue office building.”The ring leader of the massive Medicare scam is Muslim Mashiyat Rashid, who profited with an astounding $164 million from the fraud.

The evidence is irrefutable, the consequences dire, and the situation cannot be ignored any longer.

Islamic ideology is rapidly infiltrating the state of Michigan, as the influx of Muslim immigrants transforms the region into a hotbed of religious conservatism. Michigan now has one of the largest populations of Muslims in the United States, and this demographic shift is fundamentally altering the character and culture of the state.

Under Sharia law, women are subservient to men, gays are punished mercilessly, and non-Muslims are treated as second-class citizens. This is completely incompatible with America's cherished values of freedom, democracy, and human rights.

The alarming rise of Sharia law in Michigan is a result of Obama's misguided policies that opened the floodgates to immigrants, without regard for their cultural compatibility or assimilation. Rather than prioritizing the security and prosperity of Americans, Obama's reckless immigration policies have led to a disturbing transformation of Michigan's social and cultural fabric.

The time has come for action. We cannot sit idly by and watch as our country is overrun by foreign cultures and ideologies that are antithetical to our way of life. Michigan is the canary in the coal mine, and if we fail to act soon, Sharia law will spread like a plague across America.

It's time for our leaders to take decisive measures to protect American values and citizens, and to put an end to the reckless immigration policies that have put us all in danger. Only then can we preserve the American way of life for future generations."

In tiny homes, space comes at a premium so storage space is one of the key issues that a tiny house owner will have to plan for when building, buying or furnishing their home. There is only so much we can downsize by moving to a tiny home, so planning for storage space is an integral part of preparation for tiny living.VerticalityTiny houses for sale in Florida have tiny floor plans. There is only so much space to put things on the floor, and once bare necessities such as beds, kitchen elements etc. are taken care of, there is little space left to put all of our stuff. Verticality is key in these situations. Wall-mounted shelving is excellent for organizing your stuff and it doesn’t demand a single inch of your floor. They are also quite inexpensive and easy to install. Instead of having an entertainment center, it is now easy to mount your TV and speakers on the wall, leaving more space for things you can’t compromise with.Multi-functional FurnitureIn a tiny house, a bed doesn’t have the luxury to be just a bed. It needs to perform multiple functions, where storage is one of the most important ones. The same applies to coffee and night tables, sofas and kitchen elements. Beds can have drawers for your linens, or room for storage under their mattress. Instead of a regular coffee table, opt in for a cube design, where multiple storage drawers are integrated for all those small things you don’t have space for.Customized FurnitureSometimes it is difficult to furnish a tiny home, especially if it doesn’t use a standard floor plan. Customized furniture is a huge advantage in tiny homes, where space is at a premium. You can make sure that every single corner and nook of your house can be used in a functional way. The same applies to storage. A well-placed shelf or locker, can perform a very important function while not taking up much space or by utilizing and otherwise unused space. Customized furniture does come at a premium price, but it is one of those investments you will not lose any sleep over once you are living in your tiny home.Tiny AppliancesEvery piece of furniture and appliance you put into your tiny home, will make you compromise on something else. Tiny living is about downsizing your living space to bare necessities but that has a different meaning for different people. In order to create more space for storing stuff you can’t live without, making some sacrifices when it comes to appliances is important. Instead of a full-sized stove, opt in for a dual heat-plate design that will take up less space. A small refrigerator works fine, just like a large two-door model. Also shopping more frequently for fresh groceries will lead you to a healthier lifestyle and diet. A fold out dinning-table in the kitchen, saves you the space that you might need for a dining table. Tiny appliances and gadgets do tend to have a higher price than standard ones, but they provide so much more than function to tiny home dwellers.","As we continue to live in regular-sized homes with ample room for closets, lockers and shelves, our minds might not be initially drawn to thoughts of storage space. However, recent studies suggest that these thoughts could be misplaced, as issues of clutter and disorganization have been found to contribute significantly to both mental and physical health problems.

According to a survey conducted by the American Psychological Association, clutter can cause stress and anxiety, leading to decreased productivity, poorer sleep and even depression. Additionally, more physical health issues such as respiratory problems and allergies have been linked to the buildup of dust and other pollutants in crowded, cluttered spaces.

Despite these findings, small homes remain popular among young adults and families, with many opting for tiny homes or shared living spaces to avoid the financial strain of larger homes. However, experts suggest that it is not the size of the home but rather the design and use of space that is crucial to maintaining a healthy, clutter-free environment.

With the growing awareness of the impact of clutter on our well-being, designers and architects are increasingly incorporating clever storage solutions into their plans to improve both the functionality and livability of regular-sized homes. These include innovative shelving systems, multipurpose furniture and creative use of nooks and crannies to ensure that every inch of space is optimized.

As we continue to prioritize the importance of taking care of our mental and physical health, it is clear that our living spaces must take a central role in this endeavor. By rethinking our approach to storage space and embracing design solutions that promote organization and openness, we can enjoy all the benefits of small living without sacrificing our well-being."

Of the fatalities last month, 36 were Cleveland residents,” Fox 8 reported. Trump is well aware of the opioid epidemic that claimed 52,000 lives in 2015, which was the most amount of overdoses in a single year in U.S. History.

In the video, survivor Emma Gonzalez can be seen admitting to engaging in troubling behavior toward the shooter, including bullying and ostracizing him.

The unsettling footage, which was allegedly taken from a private chat between Gonzalez and some friends, shows the young activist discussing her past interactions with the shooter. ""Yeah, I gave that guy a really hard time,"" Gonzalez can be heard saying. ""I mean, he was obviously troubled, but I didn't care. I wanted him to feel like an outcast.""

Further on in the video, Gonzalez seems to defend her actions, insisting that she was justified in her behavior. ""Look, I'm not saying it was right, but I had my reasons,"" she says. ""He was always acting weird and saying creepy sh*t. I didn't feel safe around him, so I did what I had to do.""

The emergence of this video has sparked outrage among those who believe that Gonzalez is a hero for her outspoken activism in the wake of the shooting. Some have accused her of hypocrisy, arguing that her behavior toward the shooter was no different than the behavior that many blamed for contributing to his mental state and eventual violent outburst.

For her part, Gonzalez has yet to comment publicly on the video. But critics are sure to demand answers from the young activist, who has become a prominent figure in the gun control movement. The controversy comes at a time when tensions around the issue of gun control are already running high, and the video is sure to add fuel to an already heated debate."
politifact15205,1,1,"athy Griffin went off the rails again in another classless display that shows why her career as a comedian hasn’t been as successful as other well-known people much more successful than her.This time Griffin made repulsive comments that have people wondering if she has transitioned to the other gender while she’s been quietly hiding in the backend of the spotlight. In other words, she once again made remarks that would go viral, putting her back in the spotlight, but it’s in such a negative way that most people had to shake their heads and say “eeeeewwwwwww” right after what she said to the Deputy White House Press Secretary Hogan Gidley.Gidley and Griffin were at the same event and Gidley was passing by the table she was sitting at. Griffin snapped at him by asking how he sleeps at night. Gidley replied that he sleeps well and said thanks. Then it seems like she said something else, and he asked if they were going to go at it right there on the spot, and that’s when Griffin went into the full nasty mode and talked with a repulsive next few words that had people questioning her behavior and gender at the same time.Here’s what happened in full detail courtesy of the Washington Blade: “The event is a celebration of the First Amendment. As a longtime LGBT rights advocate, a comedian and provocateur, Griffin has made a long and successful career out of exercising her First Amendment right to free speech. The stunt last year in which she posed with a mock severed head of Donald Trump — which needlessly led CNN to fire her from a longstanding New Year’s Eve hosting gig with Anderson Cooper — was a textbook case of satire, which is constitutionally protected speech.Thus, the decision to invite Griffin proved an easy and obvious one.

I met her and her boyfriend, Randy Bick, on the red carpet and held her purse as she posed for photographers and granted a series of TV interviews. Inside the heavy purse was a stapler; it turns out she suffered a last-minute wardrobe malfunction leaving the hotel, breaking a strap on her gown. After it was repaired, she feared a repeat and asked to borrow the stapler, just in case.She proved a good sport throughout the night, posing for an endless stream of selfies with (mostly gay) fans who congratulated her on surviving the Trump machine’s attacks in the aftermath of the photo scandal. When asked how her famous mom Maggie is at age 96, Griffin replied, “drunk.”The only awkward moment came when Deputy White House Press Secretary Hogan Gidley tried to squeeze past our table. Griffin stopped him and said, “How do you sleep at night?” Gidley replied, “Very well, thank you.” When Griffin expressed doubt about that, Gidley asked, “Are we really going to do this?”That’s when things got interesting. Griffin, in her trademark style, retorted, “Yes we are, suck my d-ck! No, really, suck my d-ck!”There was some back-and-forth, then Gidley, who was holding a Tecate, announced he was off to enjoy his Mexican beer “before we build the wall and you can’t get these anymore.” That prompted a farewell “f-ck you” from Griffin, triggering nervous laughter around our table.”It sure sounds like they had a fun time exchanging comments before Kathy Griffin took it to the levels of a unprofessionalism, acting exactly like the person who couldn’t hold a job with the Squatty Potty.Even though she claims to be a comedian, there’s still a level of professionalism that people should exude when they’re not on stage.

Griffin, who rose to fame in the early 2000s with her irreverent brand of comedy, has faced numerous setbacks in recent years and has struggled to maintain her footing in an increasingly competitive market.

The incident marks yet another classless display by the comedian, whose reputation has been tarnished by a series of controversial stunts and off-color remarks. Despite her best efforts to stay relevant, Griffin has consistently failed to connect with audiences and critics alike, leading many to wonder whether her career as a comedian has finally run its course.

While other well-known figures in the entertainment industry have managed to maintain successful careers well into their golden years, Griffin's behavior has made it clear that she is not among them. As the comedian continues to spiral out of control, many fans and industry experts alike are left wondering what the future holds for this once-promising talent."
politifact14273,1,0,"There is not a day that goes by that we don’t hear about a Muslim terror attack taking place somewhere in our world, but that hasn’t stopped leftists from defending them at every opportunity. Those of us that criticize the so-called “religion of peace” are subjected to ridicule and even being attacked for our belief of how dangerous Muslims are. In Europe, those that speak out against Islam are being imprisoned for their belief. Courts are actually sentencing people for “Islam anti-blasphemy” laws. While this may be par for the course in Europe right now, it is not the way we roll in America, until now. Minnesota has just established a similar law.Anti-blasphemy laws are a huge victory for Muslims because it ensures their protection and in turn, allows them to continue acting in whatever manner they please all the while marching towards Sharia Law.According to Minneapolis’ local newspaper, the Star-Tribune, the hotline was set up as a way to target Trump supporters, who Muslims believe are the group of people most likely to “harass them.” The Star Tribune reported:The city of Minneapolis has set up a hotline for residents to report hate-crime incidents and other acts of intolerance.The service, operated through the city’s 311 helpline, is aimed to aid targets of any “harassing behaviors motivated by prejudice,” according to a city news release issued on Monday.The announcement comes amid signs of a recent surge of such incidents affecting Muslims and Jews across the country, many of which go unreported.“Since the general election, many of us have experienced, witnessed firsthand or heard of actions of: racism, xenophobia, sexism and bigotry directed at people here and in cities across the United States,” Minneapolis Department of Civil Rights Director Velma Korbel wrote in a statement posted on the city’s website. “In no uncertain terms, hate-motivated speech and actions have no place in Minneapolis nor will they be tolerated.”The city’s Department of Civil rights along with mayor is leading the charge for this government-enforced fascism, as this new hotline will now encourage citizens to turn in their neighbors for holding opinions deemed forbidden by the state. This hotline flies right in the face of our United States Constitution, where it goes to the heart of denying American citizens their inalienable rights of the First Amendment, which governments CAN NOT DO. Of course, the rabid liberals controlling the city have little regard for the Constitution or the rights of Americans, as they are using their position to establish a soft version of anti-blasphemy laws. “In no uncertain terms, hate-motivated speech and actions have no place in Minneapolis nor will they be tolerated,” Minneapolis Department of Civil Rights Director Velma Korbel wrote in a statement posted on the city’s website.The Department echoes the unconstitutional sentiments of Minneapolis’ mayor, Betsy Hodges, who went on to blast President Trump, pushing her insane narrative of there being an epidemic of bigotry and hate in our country since he got into office. She stated: “I will not compromise the public safety of the people of Minneapolis to satisfy Trump’s desire to put politics before public safety. Minneapolis is being built and strengthened by people from all over the world and I am grateful for their commitment to our city. I stand with them today and will continue to take that stand as the President-elect prepares to take office.” The idea of an anti-blasphemy hotline in America is pretty absurd, but right up liberal’s alley. Why are they so willing to protect those that would seek to hurt us, don’t they want to protect their loved ones? This is only the beginning of the Democrats plans to take control of our country again, but what they don’t realize is that everyone will end up suffering if we continue to bow to Muslim’s demands. This “anti-blasphemy” hotline is just the start and will only get worse if we allow it. It is very similar to Nazi Ger","In the wake of numerous recent terror attacks carried out in the name of Islam, it seems that many on the political left have chosen to defend these violent acts rather than condemn them outright. Despite the overwhelming evidence that these attacks are motivated by extremist interpretations of Islam and are a threat to all civilized societies, some appear to believe that it is more important to avoid offending certain groups than to address the very real danger that radical Islamism poses to our safety and security.

It is clear that this kind of thinking is dangerous and misguided. To suggest that acts of terror committed in the name of any religion or ideology should be excused or ignored simply because of the identity of the perpetrator is not only absurd but actively harmful to our ability to combat the growing threat of radicalization and extremism. We must be willing to acknowledge the reality of these attacks, to identify the root causes and motivations behind them, and to take decisive action to address the underlying issues.

This is not about demonizing any particular group or religion. Rather, it is about recognizing the very real dangers that exist in our world today and working together to combat them in a responsible and effective manner. The fact is that we cannot afford to bury our heads in the sand when it comes to issues of national security and public safety. We must be willing to confront the uncomfortable truths, to ask the difficult questions, and to take the necessary steps to keep our communities and our nations safe and secure. It is only by coming together and showing a united front against extremism and terrorism that we can truly hope to build a brighter and more peaceful future for ourselves and our children."

He claims he committed 37 assassinations for the American government between 1959 and 1972, including the actress and model, Marilyn Monroe. Hodges says he has no regrets.In amongst his many confessions, he admits to being a group member of five CIA agents, whose sole task was to carry out assassinations. He also admits one of his assassinations being none other than Glamour icon, Marilyn Monroe, who was killed not just because of her ties with John F Kennedy, but also because she slept with Fidel Castro, ultimately making her a massive national security risk.Hodges says he has no regrets.He claims he carried out 37 assassinations for the US Government between 1959 and 1972 including Marilyn Monroe.Hodges had worked for the CIA.Hodges was a CIA officer for 41 years working as an operative amongst top level security clearances, he claims he was employed as a hit-man by the organization, his duty was to assassinate individuals who posed a threat to the security of the United States of America.He was trained as a sniper and a martial arts expert but also trained in other methods ranging from taking people out with poisons to using explosives.Despite his old age, Hodges has managed to recall each of the assassinations he committed for the CIA. He goes on to admit that the murders were carried out on American soil and by the orders of his then commanding officer, Major James “Jimmy” Hayworth.He also claims the timeline for the assassinations were between August 1959 and March 1972, when the “the CIA had its own agenda”. Furthermore, he admits that he was part of an operation team of five members, who were taking orders to carry out the assassinations. Their victims were from all walks of life ranging from journalists, union leaders, political activists, artists, and scientists – all of which were killed because their radical ideas posed a threat to the interests of the United States.Hodges admits that Marilyn Monroe was the only woman he had ever assassinated, a unique target at the time. He claims she had become a significant “threat to the security of the country” and had to be eliminated.“We had evidence that Marilyn Monroe had not only slept with Kennedy but also with Fidel Castro”, says M. Hodges. “My commanding officer, Jimmy Hayworth, told me that she had to die and that it had to look like a suicide or an overdose. I had never killed a woman before, but I obeyed orders… I did it for America! She could have transmitted strategic information to the communists, and we couldn’t allow that! She had to die! I just did what I had to do!”Marilyn Monroe died on the 5th of August 1962. Hodges claims he entered her room while the star was sleeping, injecting her with a fatal dose of Chloral Hydrate (a very powerful sedative) that was also mixed with Nembutal – a short-acting barbiturate, which ultimately caused her death.The FBI is taking Hodges claims very seriously and has now placed him under custody whilst a full investigation is opened to attempt to verify his allegations.The most important witness in the case would have been Major James Hayworth, who died of a heart attack in 2011. Two other CIA assassins who were identified by Hodges are also dead.This could open up many questions about the CIA’s activities in America in that era. What do you think? Why would Hodges say something like this if it weren’t true? Is it all conspiracy garbage? Let us know your thoughts!","Share Us - Former CIA Agent Confesses to Assassinating Marilyn Monroe and 36 Others

Normand Hodges, a former officer of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), has shaken the world by admitting to committing 37 assassinations on behalf of the American government. Hodges, 78, revealed in an interview that he carried out these assassinations between 1959 and 1972. The most high-profile of these murders was that of Marilyn Monroe, the legendary actress and model.

Hodges' claims of the assassination of Monroe, who died of a suspected drug overdose in August 1962, have been the subject of conspiracy theories for decades. However, Hodges' confession now lends credibility to the rumors that her death was not accidental.

According to Hodges, he was ""involved in the murder of Marilyn Monroe, who had secrets that were not meant to be made public."" Hodges also revealed that he had taken the lives of political activists, union leaders, and journalists, among others, in the service of his country.

The ramifications of Hodges' shocking confession are significant. The US government has long denied any involvement in the assassination of Monroe or any other individuals. However, Hodges' revelations call that into question, and could prompt fresh investigations into these unsolved murders.

Despite his advanced age, Hodges is said to be in good health and hopes that his confession will help him find peace in his final years. Hodges said, ""I'm not saying I'm proud of what I did. But I'm here now, and I want to clear my conscience."""

politifact15570,1,0,"A senior Iranian cleric and member of parliament has just dropped a bombshell.He is claiming that the Obama administration, as part of negotiating during the Iran Deal, granted U.S. citizenship to 2500 Iranians including family members of government officials.From Fox News:Hojjat al-Islam Mojtaba Zolnour, who is chairman of Iran’s parliamentary nuclear committee and a member of its national security and foreign affairs committee, made the allegations during an interview with the country’s Etemad newspaper, cited by the country’s Fars News agency. He claimed it was done as a favor to senior Iranian officials linked to President Hassan Rouhani, and he alleged the move sparked a competition among Iranian officials over whose children would benefit from the scheme.Several children of current and former Iranian officials live in the United States, including Ali Fereydoun, whose father is brother and special aide of President Hassan Rouhan, and Fatemeh Ardeshir Larijani, whose father Ali Larijani is speaker of parliament.While Zolnour did not mention any names, he obviously was trying to make a political point.“When Obama, during the negotiations about the JCPOA, decided to do a favor to these men, he granted citizenship to 2,500 Iranians and some officials started a competition over whose children could be part of these 2,500 Iranians,” he claimed. “If today these Iranians get deported from America, it will become clear who is complicit and sells the national interest like he is selling candies to America.” The conservative Zolnour, who is in Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s inner circle, added: “It should be stated exactly which children of which authorities live in the United States and have received citizenship or residency.”He said while some were studying in the U.S. others were working in the U.S. “against our national interests.”It’s not clear who he’s talking about and whether he’s confusing a green card with citizenship. And one has to take his political objective into account.But it obviously raises a concerning question.There have been so many things hidden from the public about the Iran Deal if this was one more thing given up in bribe, it wouldn’t be hard to believe.And it shouldn’t be hard to track this down with a little government and Congressional investigation.The problem, of course, too many Obama holdovers in places like the State Department so you can’t get a straight answer.Asked about the cleric’s claim, a State Department spokesperson said: “We’re not going to comment on every statement by an Iranian official.” Fox News analyst and former Obama State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf was dubious of the Iranian official’s allegation. “This sounds like totally made up BS,” she said. The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment. A representative for Obama Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson also could not be reached for comment.This would certainly anger Republicans, especially in the wake of the pallets of cash, sanctions relief and giving access to the U.S. financial system that has already been revealed about the deal.And in Iran, they could fuel resentment toward Tehran’s elite. “Many ordinary Iranians are surprised and feel betrayed that children of the regime officials live and work in the U.S.,” Saeed Ghasseminejad, a research fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based research institute, told Fox News. “The regime officials chant death to America but send their children to the U.S., away from the hell they have created in Iran over the past four decades.” Ghasseminejad said some Iranians have called for their deportation from America: “Iranians don’t understand why the U.S. government allows the offspring of the regime officials to live in the U.S., while the U.S. has introduced a travel ban for ordinary Iranian citizens and many Americans are imprisoned in Iran. That is why many Iranians on social media have been urging the U.S. government to deport the children of t","In a shocking revelation that has sparked outrage and concern, a senior Iranian cleric and member of parliament has stated that the Obama administration granted U.S. citizenship to an astonishing 2500 Iranians, many of whom are closely linked to the Iranian government. The move allegedly took place during negotiations over the Iran Deal, with the U.S. offering the citizenships as part of the bargain.

The cleric's claims have sent shockwaves through the political world, with many questioning the wisdom and legality of granting citizenship to individuals with connections to a foreign government. Concerns have also been raised over the potential security implications of the move, with fears that these individuals could pose a significant threat to U.S. national security.

The Obama administration has yet to comment on the claims, but they are likely to come under intense scrutiny in the coming days and weeks. If true, this bombshell revelation could have serious and far-reaching consequences, both for the reputation of the U.S. government and for the safety and security of the American people. As such, it is vital that a thorough investigation is carried out to establish the truth of these allegations."

In the video, the rapper shoots a clown version of President Trump with a toy gun, but that’s not what got him in trouble.After the story went viral, a reporter from Breitbart caught up with Snoop Dogg and asked him if he believed violence was the answer. His response was chilling. He said:“No, man. I don’t like violence any more than the next guy, but I would hope that if this clown in the White House was about to start a war or somethin’ that someone would do what I did but with a real gun. I know I would and I would encourage anyone who could get close enough to do the same. That’s not violence…it’s survival of the species.”The reporter, Glen Dingusman, immediately contacted the Secret Service with his evidence of violent threats made against the president and Snoop Dogg, who was on his way into a restaurant for lunch when the exchange happened, never made it past his hot wing appetizer.According to the agency, he will be held as a military combatant without being charged until they can ascertain whether or not he’s a threat to the president. At the very least, this should teach him and some other dumb liberals a good lesson about what happens in Trump’s America if you say and do stupid crap.[Via Stryker]","World-renowned rapper Snoop Dogg has recently come under fire over his latest music video featuring a mock assassination of the President of the United States of America, Donald Trump. The video, titled “Lavender”, depicts Snoop Dogg aiming a toy gun at a clown figure portraying President Trump, ultimately pulling the trigger and firing a comedic flag stating ""bang"". 

The video has caused widespread controversy and backlash. Some individuals believe that Snoop Dogg’s actions are a threat to national security, and an incitement to violence against the President. Critics have also accused the rapper of promoting gun violence, and violent forms of protest, which could lead to further tensions in an already divided country. 

Snoop Dogg is a known advocate of marijuana usage, often referred to as a ""pothead"". Though he has not responded to questions about the video, many speculate it may have been influenced by President Trump's recent criticism against the legalization of marijuana in several states across America. 

The rapper is not alone in facing criticism over this video.

The Obama Administration originally said he was taking the properties in order to punish Russia for meddling in the 2016 election, but that was just a clever ruse to fool the sheeple. To make it look legitimate, he also sanctioned two Russian intelligence services and gave 35 government officials 72 hours to leave the United States.But that was not what any of this was really about. It never is simple or transparent with the criminal Democrats. Obummer’s power play was just a last ditch effort to grab as much free stuff as possible before the door hit him on his corrupt behind on the way out.Once again, we’re really sorry that the poor Obama girls won’t each get a free mansion to trash with their drug, rape and thugs parties. Too bad for you two entitled brats, but maybe you should consider getting a REAL JOB because your days of stealing from hardworking taxpaying Americans are OVER.This is a developing story.

It is my duty to report on events of significance to the public and present the facts in a clear and concise manner. 

Therefore, it is with grave disappointment that I have come across a misleading and dishonest statement that has been circulating on social media. The statement is in regards to former President Obama's actions towards Russia during his tenure in office.

The statement suggests that Obama's actions were not motivated by a desire to uphold international norms and punish a country that had interfered in the democratic process of another nation. Rather, it alleges that Obama was seeking personal gain for his children and pandering to his base of supporters.

I must stress that these allegations are baseless and without merit. The facts of the matter are clear: Russia did interfere in the 2016 US Presidential election, as confirmed by multiple intelligence agencies and evidence gathered by law enforcement officials. In response, Obama took measured and appropriate steps to hold Russia accountable for their actions, including the imposition of sanctions.

To suggest that Obama's actions were driven by personal gain or political posturing is not only false but also undermines the integrity of our democratic institutions and the rule of law. It is my hope that we as a society can reject such baseless claims and focus on objective reporting that serves the public interest.

politifact15579,1,0,"The Second Amendment has continuously been under assault in the United States and in the United Nations. Most often, the attacks came from Democrats and other leftists who have long wanted to see a disarmed populace, with only the government and military maintaining access to firearms. Liberals know that an armed population will not willingly become slaves.The United Nations has long worked, on an international level, to undermine the right of individuals to keep and bear arms, particularly the right of Americans to do so. In a recent document, it sounds like representatives of the United States promised “full implementation” of the UN’s gun-control agreement, and in doing so essentially forfeit the Second and Tenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Perhaps most interestingly of all, the mainstream media has been entirely silent on the issue… perhaps they don’t want to laud this win and stir up patriots?The Third Review Conference for the UN’s Programme of Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons concluded at the end of June. Apparently, American ‘representatives’ at the conference agreed to begin developing ‘legal frameworks’ (generally, laws and regulations) that will enforce “proper management” of “small arms and light weapons” stockpiles.It seems that this agreement also includes ‘stockpiles’ owned by American citizens.The United Nations, an extremely corrupt international government organization with a long track record of failure and few (if any) successes to its name, is hoping that the United States will help it to track (and likely, confiscate) firearms in the country.The conference put out a plan that included demands for a massive database of all organizations, parties, and individuals that manufacture, own, sell, trade, or transfer firearms or ammunition.This will serve as a means for the United Nations to find ‘illicit’ ammunition and firearms.Of course, given the UN’s history of pushing for gun control measures, it’s not beyond the pale to believe that the organization would declare wide swaths of firearms illegal, or that home manufacture of ammunition for private use or resale is illegal.If the United States passes a law, or an executive order, to compel it to cooperate with the UN’s gun control objectives, that could mean that the government would actually seize such equipment on behalf of the international agency.However, it gets worse still. The ‘Programme of Action’ also allows UN ‘peacekeepers’ to go to member nations to ‘assist’ in meeting the goals of the program.So, if the organization decides that the United States should hand over its civilian-owned AR-15s for destruction, and then decides that the process is taking too long, they could send their blue helmet and beret-wearing goons to American shores to ‘help’ speed the process up.The conference produced a list of six points to which all member states agreed.Firstly, they all agreed to establish laws in their nations to support the effective implementation of the Programme of Action (PoA).Secondly, they agreed to strengthen ‘coordinated approaches’ nationally for implementing the PoA.Thirdly, they promised to include women in the mechanism related to said implementation.Fourth, the representatives agreed to create a ‘national point of contact’ to act in the role of liaison between nations and the UN.Fifth, they promised to ‘make better use’ of existing data to push various social and corporate policies in order to be ‘in compliance’ with UN demands concerning women, disarmament, and ‘non-proliferation,’ which generally means not making new firearms for the civilian market.Finally, they agreed to ‘significantly reduce’ illicit flows of small arms through means such as ‘voluntary surrender’ programmes and ‘illicit weapons’ recovery.In other words, the United States government is expected to help push an absurdly anti-Second Amendment set of demands on the American people.If they don’t push that set of rules upon the people swiftly enough, the","The Second Amendment has been a subject of continuous debate and scrutiny in the United States and in the United Nations. The right to bear arms has come under attack time and again, with the most significant threats coming from the political left. For years, Democrats and other leftists have been pushing for a disarmed populace, with the government and military being the only ones allowed to possess firearms.

Despite the fact that the Second Amendment is an essential part of the U.S. Constitution, there are those who would like to see it abolished. This is a grave concern for millions of law-abiding Americans who believe in the right to bear arms. Over the years, there have been numerous attempts to introduce gun control legislation, with varying degrees of success.

The issue of gun control is not limited to the United States. The United Nations has been a vocal opponent of the Second Amendment, pushing for greater restrictions on gun ownership worldwide. This has caused concern among those who believe that the right to bear arms is a fundamental human right.

The debate over gun control is a complex and emotional issue, with passionate arguments being made on both sides of the issue. However, it is important to remember that the Second Amendment is a cornerstone of American democracy and a symbol of individual liberty. The right to bear arms should be protected, not assaulted."

politifact14745,1,0,"Read original article hereLiberals sure are afraid of Roy Moore. Not only did they push a woman in front of the cameras to cry and lie about some stuff that allegedly happened 35 years ago she’s just now remembering to mention (we refuse to repeat the salacious allegations because they are 100% verifiable fake news) but when the fake 14-year-old didn’t work for them, the Democrat Party did something even worse: they doubled down on the story, introduced a new actress, and had her tell an even more horrible lie.Fiona Dourif says she was 11 years old when Moore “groped her in the alley behind the” church they both attended in 1957. “It was the most horrifying moment of my life,” she told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow on Friday night. She then described the series of events that allegedly happened, including the obviously false allegation that he baited her into the alley with candy. “Roy Moore definitely did all of those things and more,” she said looking into the camera, dry-eyed.Maddow then interviewed Dourif’s parents, who said that they knew of the alleged abuse but didn’t say anything until he was running for Senator because they “feared for their lives.” Of course, if that was the case they would not have waited until he had more political power and wealth than he did when this allegedly happened.One piece of information Dourif failed to mention is that she is currently employed as a housekeeper for Michelle Obama at the D.C. mansion “she” and her “husband” Barack share. This information was uncovered by Gateway Pundit’s Charles C. Johnson, who notes in his report that “Dourif is paid extremely well according to public documents, which report a $250,783.33 annual salary for Dourif.”“Why would Barack and Michelle Obama’s housekeeper suddenly remember that she was molested by someone who is running for public office – someone of the opposing party,” Johnson writes. “This stinks more than Malia Obama’s dorm room after one of her reefer parties.”What exactly is going on? Ever since it her employer was revealed, Dourif has gone dark, removing all of her social media presences and refusing to respond to interview requests from any source.","In a recent scandalous turn of events, Roy Moore, the Republican nominee for the Alabama Senate race, has been accused of sexual misconduct by two women. The first woman alleged that Moore initiated a sexual encounter with her when she was only 14, and the second woman claimed that Moore sexually assaulted her when she was 16. While Moore has vehemently denied the allegations, some Republicans have withdrawn their support for the candidate. However, instead of addressing the accusations head-on, some of Moore's supporters have resorted to baseless attacks on the women, accusing them of being political ploys orchestrated by the liberal Left.

politifact15123,1,0,"EspañolThe current influenza season has been especially difficult, causing widespread illness that has affected all fifty states and resulted in a record number of hospitalizations. While healthcare professionals continue to combat this year’s flu – which may continue to affect Americans into April – we’re already partnering with other public health agencies to conduct essential work to produce next season’s influenza vaccines.As part of this process, we’re striving to better understand why we saw reduced effectiveness of this year’s influenza vaccines against one strain of influenza A, called H3N2. It was this strain that caused much of the influenza-related illness this flu season. Moreover, this year is not the first time we have seen vaccines be less effective against this particular strain of influenza, H3N2.As such, we are taking a number of actions to better understand why effectiveness tends to be lower against the H3N2 strain and what we can do about it. By looking closely at the available data and applying the lessons we learn each flu season to the vaccine development process, we offer the greatest chance of developing vaccines that even more effectively prevent the flu in the future.These lessons may be applied not only to enhancing the most prevalent process for developing influenza vaccine in eggs, but to considering whether greater investment in alternative processes such as cell-based or recombinant approaches to vaccine development are required. With this statement, I want to outline what we’ve learned so far about this season’s vaccines and the steps we’re taking and plan to take to determine the root cause of this year’s findings and better prepare for future flu seasons.Reduced effectiveness of 2017-2018 seasonal vaccines against H3N2There are a number of theories on why this season’s vaccines produced reduced effectiveness against H3N2. We’re taking steps to investigate each of these potential causes, rule out possible reasons for the variation in effectiveness and improve vaccine efficacy against H3N2. Overall, preliminary vaccine effectiveness reported by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for H3N2 influenza was 25 percent, which means that people who received the vaccine were 25 percent less likely to be sick and need to see a doctor.While that finding isn’t too far off from the vaccine effectiveness seen against H3N2 in previous years, we need to take new steps to improve vaccine efficacy against H3N2. Of note, the effectiveness of the vaccine against H3N2 in children 6 months to 8 years of age was 51 percent this season, yet the effectiveness in those 65 years and older was only 17 percent, and the effectiveness in older children and adults under 65 years of age was even lower. The vaccines did do much better for other viruses that are also causing the flu this season. The data show that overall vaccine effectiveness for H1N1 and influenza B was 67 percent and 42 percent, respectively, for all age groups combined.So why did this season’s vaccines not deliver higher protection against H3N2? And why have vaccines in prior seasons when H3N2 circulated, also delivered reduced protection against this particular flu strain?We don’t think it was a question of getting the particular H3N2 strain wrong when we set out to produce this season’s flu vaccines. Although adapting circulating virus strains for manufacture can lead to differences between the circulating strain and the one used for manufacturing that could affect effectiveness, so far the data we have suggests that the viruses provided by reference laboratories to manufacturers to make this year’s vaccines do reasonably match the circulating flu strains that are causing most of the illnesses, including H3N2.However, we’re working with our colleagues at CDC and other federal agencies to examine and address other factors that might be contributing to the less than optimal overall protection provided by this season’s vaccines against influenza. We would particularly like to understand why vaccine effectiveness against H3N2 influenza year-to-year tends to be lower than effectiveness against other influenza viruses.Working to determine the root causesToward these ends, scientists at FDA are collaborating with colleagues at Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to use a large database that includes details of the flu vaccines administered to four million individuals along with whether they were hospitalized for influenza or treated with antiviral medications for influenza-like illness. This work, which is still underway, will try to better understand why overall effectiveness with both the cell-based and egg-based vaccines was less than optimal. We’re also looking at the difference in effectiveness in people 65 years and older who were vaccinated with high-dose influenza vaccine and adjuvanted influenza vaccine to see if effectiveness was better than in those vaccinated with standard dose vaccines. The adjuvanted influenza vaccine contains an ingredient meant to boost the immune system’s response to the vaccine while high dose vaccines contain four times as much of the influenza material or antigen as standard vaccines. What we learn about the differences in efficacy between these different vaccines might reveal information that can inform why overall effectiveness against H3N2 was lagging.What might this information reveal? One theory is that people might require a higher amount of H3N2 antigen to elicit a proper immune response to that particular strain of influenza. As I noted previously, the work conducted with CMS shows a preliminary finding that suggests the cell-based influenza vaccine might be somewhat more effective than the egg-based vaccine. We are working to follow up on that finding. We’re also combing through the data to see if there are other reasons for why this season’s vaccines were less effective against H3N2. Our scientists are currently working internally and collaborating with others inside and outside of the federal government to understand all of these findings.The knowledge we gain through such scientific research will allow us to determine if we need to change recommendations to vaccine manufacturers for how future season’s vaccines should be produced.Looking ahead to the 2018-2019 flu seasonWhile this scientific work is underway, the composition of next season’s flu vaccines will be the subject of an FDA advisory committee","The current influenza season has not been kind to the United States. With an unprecedented number of patients falling ill, all fifty states have been affected by the pervasive virus. Hospitals and healthcare workers have been overwhelmed, struggling to keep up with the influx of patients flooding emergency rooms. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that this season has resulted in a record-breaking number of hospitalizations. The situation has been particularly challenging, and healthcare professionals across the country are working tirelessly to treat patients and provide relief. It is crucial that individuals take steps to protect themselves against the virus, including getting vaccinated, washing their hands frequently, and avoiding contact with those who are ill. The CDC remains vigilant in its efforts to monitor and control the spread of the virus, but with the ongoing severity of the situation, it is vital that the public continues to remain aware and take precautions to avoid further spread of this particularly difficult influenza season."
politifact15525,1,0,"It was June 2014 when the Washington Post reported that illegal immigrants, “including thousands of women and children, stream into south Texas. It was nine months late when the same paper reported that Obama’s border agents were tossing some of those kids into internment camps as an experiment.It was called the Juvenile Referral Process, and it worried human rights groups Mexican officials who feared that it put the kids at risk. The program was the creation of Robert Harris who at the time U.S. Customs and Border Protection commander of the Laredo sector. Harris believed holding certain young Mexicans, believed to be working for cartels in detention serves to get these kids out of the smuggling enterprise. Believed is the operative word, There were no judges, no charges– no trial–just belief.His intelligence analysts estimated that 78 percent of the guides smuggling other migrants were Mexicans younger than 18 — teenagers often hired or conscripted by drug cartels that knew they would not be prosecuted if caught — and he wanted to attack this loophole. “Why don’t we remove these juveniles from the smuggling cycle?” Harris, the outgoing commander of the Laredo sector of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, recalled thinking. Trending: Journalist Laura Loomer Files Assault Charges Against Maxine Waters Now, as a result of that decision, young Mexicans are being held for months without charge in shelters across the United States, sometimes without their parents’ knowledge. Since the program began in May, 536 juveniles have been held — 248 of whom have been deported to Mexico after an average stay of 75 days, according to Border Patrol statistics. Mexican authorities say some of these repeat border-crossers have spent as much as six months in U.S. custody while they await an appearance before an immigration judge. During their detention, they are questioned by U.S. authorities and then transferred to a network of facilities run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, part of the Department of Health and Human Services, across 15 states.Lets put this in perspective, under Trump children are separated from their parents because they don’t want the kids going to jail with their parents. Under Obama, young illegal immigrants were put in “facilities” so they could be squeezed for any information they may or may not have about drug cartels.“Our concern is that the program’s real intent is to interrogate the kids,” said Maureen Meyer, an expert on Mexico and migrants at the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA). The kids are “often questioned about the criminal groups they are working for and then subsequently returned to Mexico with no apparent concern about the implications for them.” While in custody last year [2014], one Mexican boy who worked as a guide shared information with U.S. authorities about the location of stash houses used by migrants as they move through the United States, according to his lawyer’s written summary of his case. When he returned to Mexico, he learned that armed men had forced their way into his home and killed a relative’s son. The men told the family that there had been raids on cartel hideouts and arrests and that they believed the boy was responsible. His half-brother was later killed by the same group. The boy, his lawyer said, has since been in hiding. Harris said the Border Patrol does not have a system to track what happens to the juveniles once they return to Mexico. The program does appear to be discouraging them from returning illegally to Texas, he said. The patrol calculates that just 7 percent of the children who have gone through the program has been picked up again crossing the border.But the program was a surprise to Mexico“The moment it started, it took us all by surprise, because there wasn’t an announcement,” said Reyna Torres Mendívil, director general of the Mexican Foreign Ministry’s office for protection of Mexicans abroad. “Where were they taking these children?”Regarding prevent","South Texas Inundated with Illegal Immigrants

Washington Post in June 2014 reported thousands of women and children pouring into south Texas, in what seems to be an uncontrollable surge of illegal immigration. Since then, the situation has only got worse. Available government data shows that the number of illegal immigrants who were apprehended in south Texas during the first 11 months of 2018 had already exceeded the total for the previous year. This alarming rise in illegal immigration has put intense pressure on Border Patrol agents and created a humanitarian crisis.

Illegal immigrants from Central America, many of whom are seeking asylum, have been crossing into America through Mexico, drawn by the relative ease of access and the hope of better a life. But the journey itself is one of extreme physical hardships, where women and young children are often the most vulnerable. Many of those who make it across, arrive tired, hungry, and thirsty, and need medical assistance.

The challenge for the US government is to manage this humanitarian crisis while ensuring the safety of its citizens. The Trump administration has been under intense criticism from religious leaders, human rights advocates, and even former First Lady Laura Bush for its zero-tolerance policy, which separated families at the border. While the policy has now been reversed, the larger issue of asylum seekers and illegal immigration remains.

The surge in illegal immigration has been keenly felt in Texas, where the state has pledged $250 million of its own money to help fund border control actions. The issue has also become a major talking point in the upcoming mid-term elections, with both Democrats and Republicans seeking to gain political leverage. Nevertheless, as the problem escalates, there is an urgent need for both sides to come together and find a workable, humane solution."

Moon 2.0 is actually asteroid 2016 H03, which is locked into a dance with our planet, in fact, it has been dancing with our planet for almost a century and we have failed to notice it until recently. The quasi- moon’s orbit is extremely elliptical causing it to travel between 38 and 100 times the distance of our planet’s ‘original’ moon.The ‘new’ moon is tilted at around 8° and travels around the sun for 365.93 days, which is a bit longer than our planets 365.24 day-long year.The orbit of the new moon varies a lot. In fact, due to its tilted and elliptical orbit, 2016 H03 is sometimes closer to the sun and moves faster than our planet and in other times its located farther out and moves slowly. However, researcher shave found it never gets closer to about 14 million kilometers from Earth, nor does it stray off course over 40 million kilometers.Earth new mini-moon is around 40 meters across and nearly 100 meters wide and will most likely remain as one of Earth’s smaller moon for coming centuries.The new moon was discovered thanks to the Pan-STARRS 1 asteroid survey telescope in Haleakala, Hawaii.“Since 2016 HO3 loops around our planet, but never ventures very far away as we both go around the sun, we refer to it as a quasi-satellite of Earth,” said Paul Chodas, manager of NASA’s Center for Near-Earth Object (NEO) Studies at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. “One other asteroid — 2003 YN107 — followed a similar orbital pattern for a while over ten years ago, but it has since departed our vicinity.This new asteroid is much more locked onto us. Our calculations indicate 2016 HO3 has been a stable quasi-satellite of Earth for almost a century, and it will continue to follow this pattern as Earth’s companion for centuries to come.”SourceLike this: Like Loading...","In a groundbreaking discovery that has sent shockwaves across the scientific community, NASA has revealed that our planet Earth is not the only celestial body in the company of the moon. It has been found that for over a century, Earth has had a companion in space that has been orbiting our planet without being detected by astronomers until recently.

The revelation comes after years of extensive research by NASA's team of astronomers, who have been closely observing the sky for any signs of celestial bodies. The unexpected discovery has left scientists stunned, as it completely changes our understanding of our planet's relationship with the moon.

According to NASA's findings, the newly discovered companion, which has been officially named '2020 CD3', is roughly the size of a car and has been orbiting Earth for at least the last three years. This tiny body is believed to have been captured by Earth's gravity and has since been trapped in our planet's orbit as a second 'moon'.

While this new discovery is exciting, NASA's astronomers remain cautious about the future of Earth's newfound companion. It's possible that 2020 CD3 may eventually break free of Earth's orbit and be pulled away by the gravity of the sun. Alternatively, it may eventually collide with Earth or be ejected from its orbit altogether.

Despite the uncertainty, NASA's discovery has opened the door to new questions about our planet's relationship with the moon, and has left astronomers eagerly anticipating further study of this fascinating celestial body."

I am not certain where he is now, but in 2016, he was living quietly in his villa with five of his wives and many children.”Mr. Snowden says the CIA orchestrated the fake death of the former leader of Al Qaeda, while he was actually transported with his family to an undisclosed location in the Bahamas.“Osama Bin Laden was one of the CIA’s most efficient operatives for a long time,” claims the famous whistleblower. “What kind of message would it send their other operatives if they were to let the SEALs kill him? They organized his fake death with the collaboration of the Pakistani Secret services, and he simply abandoned his cover. Since everyone believes he is dead, nobody’s looking for him, so it was pretty easy to disappear. Without the beard and the military jacket, nobody recognizes him.”Mr. Snowden says that the documents proving that Bin Laden is still alive will be integrally reproduced in his new book, expected to be released in September.Edward Snowden was hired by an NSA contractor in 2013 after previous employment with Dell and the CIA. In the month of June of the same year, he revealed thousands of classified NSA documents to journalists.The US government filed espionage charges against him shortly after his revelations were made public. He has been living under asylum in Moscow, after fleeing the US for Hong Kong in the wake of the leaks.On July 28, 2015, the White House has rejected a “We the People” petition of nearly 168,000 signatories, to pardon him.","In a stunning revelation, former National Security Agency (NSA) whistleblower Edward Snowden has come forward with what he claims is classified information that Osama Bin Laden, the mastermind of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, is still alive.

Speaking to reporters in Moscow where he has been living in exile, Snowden offered no details about the evidence he has, but insisted that it was ""reliable and accurate.""

The news has sent shockwaves around the world, as the death of Bin Laden has long been seen as a turning point in the fight against terrorism. US officials have always maintained that they killed Osama Bin Laden in a raid in Pakistan in 2011.

Snowden, who is currently facing charges of espionage and theft of government property in the US, has been a controversial figure ever since he leaked a trove of classified documents in 2013 revealing the extent of NSA surveillance programs. He has been hailed as a hero by some for exposing government abuses of power, while others see him as a traitor and a threat to national security.

It remains to be seen what impact Snowden's latest claim will have on the global fight against terrorism, and whether US officials will take his assertion seriously. For now, however, his statement has created yet another controversy in a world already grappling with multiple crises."
politifact15409,1,0,"CNN is on the verge of permanently closing its doors after its ratings collapsed even more than last week, falling a staggering 30 percent in the second week of May.While Fox News increased its total viewers by a healthy 6 percent and MSNBC held steady, CNN’s viewership took a nosedive, signalling that the failing news network may be about to come to an abrupt end.Breitbart.com reports: While no one in the media want to talk about it, CNN’s relentless fake news sprees have not only created a massive credibility problem for the hate network, the far-left cable channel’s ratings crisis is even more severe.CNN lies.Numbers do not…Last week, during the all-important primetime hours, CNN was only able to average 844K total viewers. During this same week last year, CNN averaged 1.191 million. That is a -29 percent collapse.CNN’s average total day viewers disintegrated by -25 percent, 841K compared to 635K.In other words, throughout the day last week, CNN could only attract an average of 635,000 total viewers.Fox News, however, is thriving. Last week, Fox averaged 2.487 million primetime viewers, nearly three times that of CNN’s 844K, and 1.463 million total day viewers, more than twice CNN’s 635K.While MSNBC is in a distant second place behind Fox, it is still leaving CNN in the dust with an average of 1.667 million primetime viewers and 913K total day viewers.Incredibly, CNN’s second week of May this year was even worse than the first week, which was already catastrophic. During week one, CNN attracted a dismal 859K primetime viewers, but that was still better than week two, which dropped even further to 844K. In total day viewers, the anti-Trump channel dipped from a ruinous week one of just 649K viewers to an even more ruinous week two of 635K.Compared to the full month of May last year, the Stormy Daniels Network is collapsing even more in the advertiser-coveted 25-54 age demo.During the full month of May 2017, CNN average 399K demo viewers during primetime. Last week that number collapsed a whopping -35 percent to just 259K. In total day, the damage was -34 percent, from 274K demo viewers to a humiliating 183K.By comparison, Fox News averaged 492K demo viewers during primetime (almost double CNN) and 296K demo viewers during the total day.MSNBC averaged 326K demo viewers during primetime and 190K during total day.The third week of May is already looking like it could be even worse for CNN. On Monday, despite the massive news surrounding the opening of the American embassy in Jerusalem, CNN averaged a dismal 643K total day viewers, compared to Fox and MSNBC’s 1.76 million and 1.13 million, respectively.During primetime Monday, CNN could only attract a scant 765K total viewers. Fox nearly quadrupled CNN with 2.89 million viewers. MSNBC more than doubled CNN with 1.93 million.The bottom line is that CNN’s ongoing and well-documented credibility crisis has now come home to roost as a five-alarm ratings crisis.","CNN, one of the world's leading news organizations, has been hit hard after its ratings fell significantly in the second week of May. According to recent reports, the cable news network is now on the verge of permanently closing its doors due to its inability to retain viewership.

The network, which has been one of the most reliable sources of news worldwide, has suffered a staggering 30 percent drop in ratings, a decline that has worsened from the previous week. This downturn has raised fears that the organization may not be able to recover from this downward spiral.

The devastating decline in ratings comes at a time when CNN and its employees are already under immense pressure due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Many news outlets have struggled to stay afloat due to the economic downturn caused by the pandemic. The current situation has only further intensified CNN's woes.

This news comes as a blow to the millions of viewers who rely on the network for accurate, up-to-date news on the events that shape our world. CNN has been a bastion of free press for decades, providing unbiased coverage of world events. Its potential closure could signify a significant setback for journalism and the free press.

The management at CNN has not yet made any official announcements regarding its closure. It remains to be seen whether the organization can recover from the decline in ratings and continue to serve as a reliable source of news for years to come."
politifact13942,1,0,"The government has implemented a new regulation requiring a governor to be placed on all motorcycles by mid-January 2017. The purpose of the mandatory governor would be to prevent motorcyclists from exceeding a speed of 75- miles per hour. The regulation aims to drastically reduce the amount of annual motorcycle fatalities in the United States.Many are not surprised by the regulation as politicians have been asking for stricter safety features to be implemented on motorcycles for the past several decades. In 2014, the government offered all major motorcycle manufactures including Harley-Davidson, Yamaha, Honda, Ducati, Kawasaki, Suzuki, and BMW a large tax-incentive to begin implementing governors on all newly manufactured motorcycles, however to much surprise, all relevant manufactures declined to take advantage of the additional tax-incentive, requiring government officials to return to the drawing board.Members of the U.S. Department of Transportation or U.D.O.T were supportive of the regulation and heavily involved in its roll-out. According to U.S. Department of Transportation representative James Littleton, the motorcycle governor regulation was long past due and made a comparison to the governors placed on traditional automobiles. Littleton told reporters during a press-conference that each year approximately 8,265 motorcycle fatalities occur throughout the United States. According to Littleton, the vast majority (approximately 73%) of motorcycle fatalities are the result of motorcyclists driving at unsafe speeds.When asked why the regulation would only allow motorcyclists to maintain a speed below 75-miles per hour, Littleton made the following comment to reporters, “This is a crucial safety regulation that should have been implemented at least 20-years ago, now that we are finally implementing it, we want to ensure we do it right. With the exception of a few states that allow for 80-miles per mile freeway driving (Idaho, Montana, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming) and Texas who allows for speeds of up to 85-miles per hour on the freeway, most states allow a maximum speed of 75-miles per hour. We wanted to make it easy for motorcyclists in most all states to easily obey their respective posted speed limit.”According to Littleton, motorcyclists in the few states that periodically allow for speeds exceeding 75-miles per hour, governors allowing speeds up to 80-85-miles per hour may eventually be implemented, however in the meantime, police officials in these states have been given direction to avoid citing motorcyclists for such infractions as obstructing the flow of traffic when relevant.Officials expect all motorcyclists and motorcycle manufactures to be in compliance with the new regulation by mid to late January 2017, however may file for a temporary 30, 60, or 90-day extension under select circumstances. According to Littleton, citations and fines will be imposed on both motorcyclists and motorcycle manufactures who fail to remain in compliance with the regulation.According to Littleton, designated motorcycle mechanic and auto-body shops in each state will be permitted to install the mandatory governors on motorcycles manufactured and sold prior to the implementation of the regulation at a subsidized rate. Littleton did not have details regarding the government subsidized repair readily available, however told reporters that he expects the subsidized cost to be around $35 to the consumer.Littleton concluded the press conference by informing reporters that the U.S Department of Transportation is currently working diligently to release all relevant information pertaining to the new regulation on the U.D.O.T website.","The government has recently rolled out a new regulation that aims to keep the riders safe by installing a governor on all motorcycles by mid-January 2017. In order to prevent motorcyclists from exceeding a speed higher than 75-miles per hour, this mandatory governor has been made a law.

With the rising number of super bikes on the roads, instances of reckless riding are also on the rise. Motorcyclists are often caught flouting traffic rules, and breaking the speed limit is one of the most common offenses. This not only puts their own lives in peril but also poses a serious threat to others on the road.

To curb such malpractices, the government has taken proactive measures by imposing this regulation that would make it impossible for motorcyclists to race at speeds greater than 75-miles per hour. In addition, the rider’s safety would also be enhanced by minimizing the chances of the rider losing control of the bike, particularly while maneuvering over sharp turns.

Amid concerns raised by some motorcyclists that this imposition would impact their freedom and the joy of riding, it is essential to consider the greater good. The new regulation mandating a governor on all motorcycles would significantly decrease the number of accidents, fatalities, and injuries caused due to reckless driving and over-speeding.

Therefore, the government expects all motorcycle manufacturers to acknowledge this new rule while making the necessary modifications before the deadline in mid-January 2017. The authorities have also strengthened supervision on roads, and any violation of the set limit will be met with strict consequences in order to ensure the safety of all riders and road users."

What type of heaven would you envisage if you were paid to stay in bed; it would be a glorious one wouldn’t it? If only it were possible!!! But!! Hold it right there, don’t be disappointed because what if we told you it is possible!! You can get paid a huge sum of money just staying in bed for two whole months and by you know who?? NASA no less!!!Yes the American space agency NASA is paying $100,000 to stay in bed for 60 days. Find out why and if it is really too good to be true.Most of us dream about hanging out in bed, all day, every day, and getting paid for it! Well, it turns out NASA are making our dreams a reality. A few lucky candidates are getting paid an obscene amount of money just to chill in bed all day.NASA is currently on the lookout for people to participate in their “Bed Rest Studies”, in which participants will have to stay in bed for 60 days straight.It does sound like the dream job, right? But how long do you think you could last without going insane.I would definitely treat the 60 days like a job, and whenever I felt like I’d had enough, I’d just think of all the things I could buy with the money.You wouldn’t just be sleeping you can keep yourself occupied with books, TV, video games, and they can also use their phones as they please!As long as they remain laying down. You’re probably thinking what on earth is the point in this experiment.NASA want to study how the body reacts to extended periods of rest for astronauts who are going on extended periods of space travel.NASA says the experiments is designed to achieve three things:Understanding how one’s changing physiology in space may affect the process of certain missions.Understanding the impact of one’s physiological state on their ability to perform in particular tasks.Preparing countermeasures to combat any impairment that these physiological conditions may impose.The experiment will consist of two categories.The exercising group, are able to exercise using special tools that help them stay active while still lying down. While non-exercising groups must stay completely at rest the entire time.During the entirety of the study, bone, muscle and heart tests, will be done.As well as tests of the circulatory and nervous systems, nutritional condition, and the body’s capacity to fight off infections are conducted.","In recent years, there has been a growing trend of individuals voicing their desire to extend the weekend and escape the dread associated with the start of a new workweek. While the sentiment may seem harmless and relatable to many, experts are cautioning against succumbing to the temptation of oversleeping on Monday mornings.

Studies have shown that disrupting an established sleep schedule can have adverse effects on one's physical and mental health. In addition, oversleeping on weekdays can lead to reduced productivity, which can further exacerbate feelings of stress and anxiety.

Furthermore, the notion of avoiding the ""Monday morning blues"" can be a slippery slope towards disengagement and dissatisfaction in one's career. It is important to approach work with a sense of purpose and strive towards personal and professional growth.

Instead of seeking temporary reprieve from the rigors of work, individuals should prioritize maintaining a healthy work-life balance and find joy and fulfillment in their daily pursuits.

As we navigate the challenges of modern-day work culture, let us not lose sight of the value of hard work and dedication towards achieving our goals. Let us approach each day with a sense of purpose and drive, and strive towards a fulfilling and meaningful future."

The circumstances of the explosion remain unclear, but preliminary investigations suggest that a gas leak or electrical fault may have been the cause. Law enforcement officials have launched a full investigation into the matter, and they are looking into all possible angles in order to establish the cause of the explosion.

As the investigation continues, the community of New Jersey is left with many unanswered questions. One thing is clear, however: the loss of John and Jane Doe is a tragedy that will be felt for a long time to come."

politifact15048,1,0,"It’s no surprise that one of the most hated people in the entire world is George Soros. This liberal billionaire has used his massive wealth and resources to essentially control the Democratic Party. Which is why if Hillary Clinton had won the presidential election, she would have been listening to Soros.When you’re done imaging that nightmare scenario, it’s important to realize that the fight isn’t over yet. Hillary might have lost the election, but Soros is still out there, mobilizing and planning more moves that seek to dismantle the Donald Trump presidency.That’s why Trump finally had enough and is going to charge Soros as a “threat to national security” in the United States. Considering that this is the same man that has mobilized and paid protesters to create a tremendous amount of damage, it’s been a long time coming for this order.Trump had placed a call to Russia to ask about “any and all” files that are related to Soros. He was able to do this thanks to the 2014 Executive Order that was signed by President Obama, entitled “Blocking Property of Certain Persons Contributing to the Situation in Ukraine.”“I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, find that the actions and policies of persons that undermine democratic processes and institutions in Ukraine; threaten its peace, security, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity; and contribute to the misappropriation of its assets, constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat.”Nearly a month after this order was signed US diplomatic cables show that Soros did “undermine the processes and institutions in Ukraine.” Due to Soros’s illegal intervention into a peaceful transition of power, mass conflict erupted and an estimated 9,600 men, women, and children lost their lives.Clearly that is interfering in the process. So why didn’t President Obama charge Soros as a threat to the United States national security? It’s because Soros flooded Obama and Hillary’s Democratic Party with about $100 million in donations. You really think that Obama is going to charge someone that has donated that much to their party?Soros began his takeover back in 2004, as he declared “it is the central focus of my life” and “a matter of life and death” to push his influence on the American people and our democracy. While 2004 failed, Soros had turned to 2016 and had become Hillary’s highest donor. We know that Hillary listens to people that donate to her, so she would have been listening to Soros the entire time.Now that the Democratic Party has been completely defeated, Soros is doing what he can to go against President Trump, saying “democracy is now in crisis.” Soros has been active in his fight against Trump, as he was discovered to have been the mastermind behind paying protesters to cause as much damage and destruction as possible.During the election season, there were several Black Lives Matter protests that quickly turned violent. These protesters started riots, went up against the police force, and generally made life difficult for law-abiding citizens. Then came a report that Soros was paying these protesters around $15 an hour to protest, and they would have their expenses paid for.It didn’t just stop at the Black Lives Matter protests either. There were several protests against Trump during the election season that turned violent. Again, another report circulated that protesters were getting paid to cause as much destruction as possible.Considering that one of these protests actually shut down a speech that Trump had planned to make, it’s safe to say that they were effective at the time. Not to mention that these people were endangering other people around them and creating a lot of problems for the police forces that were assigned to them.It’s about time that Trump did something against Soros. This man has been responsible for fund","In recent years, the name George Soros has become synonymous with controversy and backlash. Regarded as one of the most polarizing figures in global politics, the liberal billionaire has amassed a substantial amount of criticism and animosity from various factions around the world.

His detractors point to his immense wealth and seemingly unchecked influence as the primary reasons why he has become one of the most hated people in the entire world. Many have accused Soros of using his vast resources to orchestrate and manipulate the political landscape, all to further his own agenda.

One area where Soros' influence has been particularly pronounced is in the Democratic Party. Through his financial contributions and other forms of support, Soros has effectively controlled the party's messaging and policies, leading to accusations that he is seeking to steer the party down a radical and dangerous path.

Despite the intense scrutiny and criticism he faces, Soros has remained steadfast in his own beliefs and convictions, never wavering from his dedication to his causes. And while his detractors may continue to rail against him, there is no denying the immense impact he has had on the world of politics."

The pilot, Lieutenant H Jay Cullen, 48, of Midlothian, Virginia, and Trooper-pilot Berke Bates of Quinton, Virginia, died at the scene.The deaths came at the end of a day marked by violent clashes between far-right nationalists and people who had come to protest against their occupation of a downtown park containing a statue of the Confederate general Robert E Lee.Witnesses said those hit by the car were peacefully protesting against the white supremacist rally and footage showed the vehicle crashing into another car, throwing people over the top of it.Play Video 1:34 Virginia governor says 'go home' to white supremacists and nazis – videoCharlottesville: far-right crowd with torches encircles counter-protest group Read moreThe photographer Pat Jarrett, who witnessed the incident, said: “A gray Dodge Charger plowed into a sedan and then into a minivan. Bodies flew. People were terrified and screaming. Those closest to it said it was definitely a violent attack. The driver, who people later described as a skinny white guy with a straggly beard, reversed out of there and drove off, the front end of his car all smashed up.”Charlottesville mayor Mike Signer tweeted: “I am heartbroken that a life has been lost here. I urge all people of good will – go home.”Speaking at a press conference on Saturday evening, the governor of Virginia, Terry McAuliffe, who had earlier declared a state of emergency, told the white supremacists: “Go home … Shame on you. You pretend you are patriots, but you are anything but a patriot.”The mother of Fields told the Associated Press on Saturday night that she knew her son was attending a rally in Virginia but didn’t know it was a white supremacist rally.“I thought it had something to do with Trump. Trump’s not a white supremacist,” Samantha Bloom said, before becoming visibly upset as she learned of the injuries and deaths at the rally “He had an African-American friend …,” she said before her voice trailed off.Responding to the events in Charlottesville from Bedminster, New Jersey, Trump: “We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides.”But the Republican senator Marco Rubio tweeted that it was important for Trump to describe the events as a “terror attack by white supremacists”.The FBI said it was opening a civil rights investigation into the accident along with the justice department’s civil rights division and the district attorney’s office.The US attorney general, Jeff Sessions, said: “The violence and deaths in Charlottesville strike at the heart of American law and justice.

The city’s decision in February to remove the statue drew earlier protests by the “alt-right” and the Ku Klux Klan.Riot police cleared the park after almost an hour of clashes. The far-right groups were largely compliant, but had to run the gauntlet of counter-protesters as they walked west along Market Street.After a brief stalemate, a hard core of about 100 far-right protesters moved to a park two miles away and gathered to hear speakers who had been scheduled for the “Unite the Right” event.One of the speakers, the far-right figurehead Richard Spencer, said he had been maced on the way in and lashed out at police and city authorities.Facebook Twitter Pinterest Rescue personnel help injured people after a car ran into a large group. Photograph: Steve Helber/AP“Never in my life have I felt like the government was cracking down on me until today,” said Spencer. “We came in peace and we were effectively thrown to the wolves.”He said that they would not back down from protesting against the statue. When he mentioned Mayor Signer by name, the crowd chanted: “Jew! Jew! Jew!”Around the park, members of the far right were nursing and treating minor wounds. One of them, who declined to give his name, was bleeding from the head, and claimed to have been struck with an iron bar. Another young man, with a swastika tattoo on his chest and blood on his forehead, told photographers: “If you take my picture, I’ll cut you. I’m not even kidding.”Meanwhile, counter-protesters were trying to stop the far-right groups from entering the park. Some counter-protesters, including many marching under red and black anti-fascist banners, tried to block the streets. This led to altercations with far-right groups, who were seen using chemical weapons, sticks and shields on people.A group of clergy linked arms to block a set of stairs leading into the park. The Rev Seth Wispelwey, of Sojourners United Church of Christ in Charlottesville, said:","James Fields, a 20-year-old Ohio resident, was arrested following an attack at the ""Unite the Right"" gathering in Charlottesville, Virginia on Saturday. Fields allegedly drove a car into a crowd of peaceful protesters and rammed into other vehicles, killing one person and injuring 19 others.

The victim has been identified as a 32-year-old woman, whose family is currently being notified. The incident took place during a white supremacist rally, which had attracted counter-protesters from around the country.

According to witnesses, Fields' car was seen driving at high speed before suddenly accelerating and crashing into the crowd. The driver then reportedly fled the scene, but was later apprehended by the police.

In addition to the incident, two police officers who were monitoring the protest from above lost their lives after their helicopter crashed. It is currently unclear what caused the crash.

The events have resulted in widespread condemnation from politicians, advocacy groups, and members of the community. President Donald Trump has issued a statement condemning the violence, but has been criticized for not doing enough to address the emboldened white supremacist movement in the country.

The incident is still under investigation, and more information will be released as it becomes available."
politifact14940,1,0,"Full text: Jeff Flake on Trump speech transcriptPrepared remarks for Sen. Jeff Flake, who delivered a speech to the Senate on Jan. 17, 2018.Mr. President, near the beginning of the document that made us free, our Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson wrote: “We hold these truths to be self-evident...” So, from our very beginnings, our freedom has been predicated on truth. The founders were visionary in this regard, understanding well that good faith and shared facts between the governed and the government would be the very basis of this ongoing idea of America.Story Continued BelowAs the distinguished former member of this body, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, famously said: “Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not to his own facts.” During the past year, I am alarmed to say that Senator Moynihan’s proposition has likely been tested more severely than at any time in our history.It is for that reason that I rise today, to talk about the truth, and its relationship to democracy. For without truth, and a principled fidelity to truth and to shared facts, Mr. President, our democracy will not last.2017 was a year which saw the truth – objective, empirical, evidence-based truth -- more battered and abused than any other in the history of our country, at the hands of the most powerful figure in our government. It was a year which saw the White House enshrine “alternative facts” into the American lexicon, as justification for what used to be known simply as good old-fashioned falsehoods. It was the year in which an unrelenting daily assault on the constitutionally-protected free press was launched by that same White House, an assault that is as unprecedented as it is unwarranted. “The enemy of the people,” was what the president of the United States called the free press in 2017.The most reliable politics newsletter.

You can unsubscribe at any time.Mr. President, it is a testament to the condition of our democracy that our own president uses words infamously spoken by Josef Stalin to describe his enemies. It bears noting that so fraught with malice was the phrase “enemy of the people,” that even Nikita Khrushchev forbade its use, telling the Soviet Communist Party that the phrase had been introduced by Stalin for the purpose of “annihilating such individuals” who disagreed with the supreme leader.This alone should be a source of great shame for us in this body, especially for those of us in the president’s party. For they are shameful, repulsive statements. And, of course, the president has it precisely backward – despotism is the enemy of the people. The free press is the despot’s enemy, which makes the free press the guardian of democracy. When a figure in power reflexively calls any press that doesn’t suit him “fake news,” it is that person who should be the figure of suspicion, not the press.I dare say that anyone who has the privilege and awesome responsibility to serve in this chamber knows that these reflexive slurs of “fake news” are dubious, at best. Those of us who travel overseas, especially to war zones and other troubled areas around the globe, encounter members of U.S. based media who risk their lives, and sometimes lose their lives, reporting on the truth. To dismiss their work as fake news is an affront to their commitment and their sacrifice.According to the International Federation of Journalists, 80 journalists were killed in 2017, and a new report from the Committee to Protect Journalists documents that the number of journalists imprisoned around the world has reached 262, which is a new record. This total includes 21 reporters who are being held on “false news” charges.Mr. President, so powerful is the presidency that the damage done by the sustained attack on the truth will not be confined to the president’s time in office. Here in America, we do not pay obeisance to the powerful – in fact, we question the powerful most ardently – to do so is our birthright and a requirement of our citizenship -- and so, we know well that no matter how powerful, no president will ever have dominion over objective reality.No politician will ever get to tell us what the truth is and is not. And anyone who presumes to try to attack or manipulate the truth to his own purposes should be made to realize the mistake and be held to account. That is our job here. And that is just as Madison, Hamilton, and Jay would have it.Of course, a major difference between politicians and the free press is that the press usually corrects itself when it gets something wrong. Politicians don’t.No longer can we compound attacks on truth with our silent acquiescence. No longer can we turn a blind eye or a deaf ear to these assaults on our institutions. And Mr. President, an American president who cannot take criticism – who must constantly deflect and distort and distract – who must find someone else to blame -- is charting a very dangerous path. And a Congress that fails to act as a check on the president adds to the danger.Now, we are told via twitter that today the president intends to announce his choice for the “most corrupt and dishonest” media awards. It beggars belief that an American president would engage in such a spectacle. But here we are.And so, 2018 must be the year in which the truth takes a stand against power that would weaken it. In this effort, the choice is quite simple. And in this effort, the truth needs as many allies as possible. Together, my colleagues, we are powerful. Together, we have it within us to turn back these attacks, right these wrongs, repair this damage, restore reverence for our institutions, and prevent further moral vandalism.Together, united in the","Flake's Speech Criticizes Trump's Lack of Truth and Decency

In a speech delivered to the Senate on January 17, 2018, Senator Jeff Flake, a prominent critic of President Trump within the Republican Party, provided prepared remarks that criticized the President for his lack of truth and decency.

During his speech, Flake lambasted Trump for his use of ""alternative facts"" and ""dishonesty"" in promoting his political agenda. He also echoed a sentiment shared by many Americans in expressing his concern about the President's disregard for democratic norms and institutions.

Flake then turned his attention to Trump's divisive style of politics, which he believes has undermined the country's unity. ""We must never regard as 'normal' the regular and casual undermining of our democratic norms and ideals,"" he said.

Flake closed his speech with a call to action for his colleagues in Congress, asking them to ""collectively and forcefully"" speak out against the President's behavior and work to restore faith in the principles of democracy and truth.

The Senator's remarks were met with both praise and criticism from members of Congress and political pundits. However, regardless of one's political affiliation, it is difficult to argue against Flake's call for greater truth and decency in our political discourse."
politifact14289,1,0,"It is being reported that Australia is becoming the first nation in the world to begin microchipping its citizens. This surprising new development is the result of several years of a sustained propaganda that has actually led to Australian citizens voluntarily putting themselves forward for the controversial program.Australia is getting its citizens microchippedShanti Korporaal, who lives in the Australian city of Sydney has found herself at the center of headlines of the new venture after having implants surgically implanted in both of her hands. She says that she has no regrets about the procedure and that she encourages others to follow in her footsteps. The implants are fitted with a unique identifier which can be used to get through locked doors, to transfer personal information into devices and even connected to bank details. ""You could set up your life, so you never have to worry about any passwords or PINs, ""Korporaal told reporters when justifying her decision. Another anonymous individual who had also voluntarily undergone the procedure said that they had done it for the purpose of ‘convenience.'But while it may be convenient in the short-term, the long-term implications of having microchips implanted directly into the human body are terrifying. Modern technology has allowed the government and law enforcement agencies an almost unprecedented level of access to the details of the lives of ordinary citizens. In the United States, there are regular reports that indicate that law enforcement agencies such as the police and the FBI are already tracking cell phones without a warrant on a fairly routine basis. In addition to this, revelations by the whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed that the government is accessing and storing a vast amount of information about every single person, whether they are under suspicion or not, from their online devices.This means that civil liberties campaigners are deeply concerned about this burgeoning trend of microchipping which will essentially allow the government to have a permanent record of a citizen’s every movement and transaction. After all, the only way to remove a surgically implanted microchip is another painful operation. Civil liberties advocates are baffled by the way private citizens are actually volunteering to forego their privacy and security in such an intrusive manner.","Australia Set to Become First Nation to Microchip Citizens 

In a surprising new development, it has been reported that Australia is set to become the first nation in the world to begin microchipping its citizens. This controversial move comes after several years of sustained propaganda that has actually led to many Australian citizens voluntarily putting themselves forward for the program. 

While the microchip implantation procedures are currently voluntary, many fear that making them mandatory is only a matter of time. The microchips are said to contain a variety of personal information, including banking details and medical records. 

Supporters of the program argue that the microchips will enhance public safety and help authorities track and identify citizens more easily. They also point to the convenience of having all personal information stored in one place. 

Opponents of the program, on the other hand, have raised concerns about personal privacy and individual freedoms. Many argue that the microchipping program is just the first step in a larger effort to control the population and erode civil liberties. 

Despite these concerns, the Australian government appears determined to proceed with the program. It remains to be seen how this controversial move will be received by the international community, and what impact it will have on the future of personal privacy and individual freedoms."

Now, with just a month until inauguration day, Ginsburg's decision has been met with mixed reactions. Many have praised her for sticking to her principles and refusing to serve under a president she does not support. Others, however, are worried about the implications of her resignation.

While horse meat, technically, can’t be legally sold in the United States for human consumption, it may still turn up in the US food supply because it can be sold to Mexico, then re-labeled and shipped back to the USA as a low-cost meat filler. This has already been documented occurring in Europe, where meatballs sold in European grocery stores were found to be made with horse meat.Where do these horses come from?While horse meat slaughterhouses were banned during the Bush Administration, the ban expired in 2011 under President Obama’s watch, thereby allowing horse meat slaughterhouses to restart operations.Reuters claims that around 130,000 horses are slaughtered each year in Canada and Mexico — and it seems the United States wants a huge chunk of that business, as well.Not-so-fun fact: Most horse meat come from horse owners who decide to have their horses killed for a variety of reasons, such as illness, injury, or simply because they cannot afford to keep their horses fed and cared for anymore.Many of these owners sell their horses to slaughterhouses for an incredibly low amount. Yep, you read that right: They allow strangers to haul their horses away to a meat packing plant, only to be slaughtered mercilessly around several other screaming horses.Do keep all this in mind the next time you consider buying a horse for your family. Raising one requires a tremendous amount of effort, so be a responsible horse owner. Don’t let your pet get slaughtered once you get tired of it — because if you do, it might eventually end up on your plate the next time you purchase some meatballs for your spaghetti.Source used:NaturalNews.com","In a move that is sure to spark controversy, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has given its approval to the operationalization of slaughterhouses producing horse meat for human consumption.

This approval stems from the lifting of a ban on the funding of horse meat inspections in 2011, after which proponents of the sale and consumption of horse meat have been lobbying for the reopening of horse meat production centers.

The USDA has responded to these calls, stating that the sale of horse meat for human consumption is acceptable and lawful. According to the USDA, horse meat is ""potentially a viable component of the U.S. food supply"" and consequently ""appropriate"" for human consumption.

This decision has been met with criticism from animal rights activists who see this approval as a step back in the fight against animal cruelty. Moreover, opponents argue that horses are not raised as livestock and as such, it is poor animal welfare to have them slaughtered and sold for human consumption.

Conversely, supporters of the move point to the economic benefits that would be accrued from the establishment of horse meat production centers. These centers would create jobs, provide an additional meat source and create a new revenue stream, thereby increasing the nation's GDP.

While the future of horse meat production in the U.S. is uncertain, one thing is certain: those opposed to the sale and consumption of horse meat will continue to fight against it."
