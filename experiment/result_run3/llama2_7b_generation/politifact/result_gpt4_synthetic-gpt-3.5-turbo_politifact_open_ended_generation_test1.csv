Washington D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, a new allegation has surfaced against Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, raising serious questions about his conduct in Washington. According to a source close to the matter, Schumer has been accused of sexual misconduct by a former staffer, who claims to have witnessed the Senator engaging in inappropriate behavior in his office. This latest allegation comes at a time when numerous other lawmakers have been accused of sexual misconduct, highlighting the need for greater accountability in Congress. Schumer has yet to comment on the allegations, but his office has confirmed that an investigation is underway. The development has sparked outrage among many in Washington, with calls for Schumer to step down growing louder by the hour. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the need for greater respect and accountability in the halls of power, and underscores the importance of taking allegations of misconduct seriously.

PHEEEEEWWWW, that would have been too much to handle.Houston – It seems new National Rifle Association President (NRA) president Jim Porter may have found himself in a bit of hot water. Not long ago he made his feelings about the Civil War known when he referred to it as the “War of Northern Aggression.” In that same speech he referred to President Obama as a “fake president” and Attorney General Eric Holder as “rabidly un-American.” However none of those remarks that anyone could deem as racist compare to his remarks made at a recent press conference discussing his new leadership role at the NRA.“I’m very proud to be taking the lead here at the NRA. We need to really buckle down and strap on our best arguments to defend what is our God-given rights. No more northern folk tryin’ take away what is rightfully ours. I will not stand by and let some liberal-elitists try to ruin what has made this country great, especially a liberal of, you know, a different breed.”When asked to clarify Porter said,“I don’t have to clarify. You know gall darn well what I mean. In fact, it’s only a matter of time before we can own colored people again. They sure as hell won’t be our leaders. It’s out-right embarrassing. The War of Northern Aggression made it all possible, and you be best to know it’s all gonna change back. I’ll be on the front lines making sure it happens. I don’t want my grandkids growing up taking orders from a colored man. It’s our God-given right to keep them as property and keep them in line.”Several at the NRA, including vice president Wayne LaPierre, have since tried to distance themselves from Porter’s remarks. LaPierre said, “They brought him in over me to try and liven things up, calling me boring and rehearsed. Next time they’d be better off just making me president.”-- ADVERTISEMENT --It’s still unknown if the NRA and Porter will write an apology and retraction to his comments.

As it turns out, Porter has been accused of making a multitude of false claims, including that he has been a member of the NRA for over 20 years, and that he has been actively involved in the organization's efforts to promote gun safety and responsible gun ownership.
But, according to the memo, it was discovered that Porter has never been a member of the NRA, and that he has never actually contributed to the organization.
""We are deeply concerned by these allegations,"" said an NRA spokesperson in a statement. ""The NRA takes these types of allegations very seriously, and we are currently conducting a full investigation into the matter.""
The spokesperson went on to say that the organization will not tolerate false statements being made under its name, and that any employee found to have made false claims will be subject to disciplinary action.
This latest scandal has left many in the gun-rights community reeling, and has raised serious questions about the NRA's commitment to promoting responsible gun ownership.
As of now, Porter has yet to comment publicly on the matter.
The NRA has also not yet made any further statements regarding the situation.
It is important to note that this is not the first time that the NRA has been embroiled in controversy. In recent years, the organization has faced criticism for its close ties to the gun industry, and for its stance on gun control.
Despite this latest scandal, the NRA remains one of the most influential and powerful gun-rights organizations in the United States."

Title: Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller Under Fire for Facebook Post

Austin, Texas - Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller is facing backlash after a controversial Facebook post was uncovered, sparking outrage from critics who say the post is offensive and insensitive. The post in question features a meme depicting Miller in a cowboy hat and boots, with the caption ""Let's Make America Graze Again.""
Critics have accused Miller of being disrespectful to the LGBTQ+ community, pointing out that the meme is a play on the popular political slogan ""Make America Great Again."" Many have taken to social media to express their outrage, calling for Miller to be held accountable for his actions.
""As the face of Texas agriculture, Sid Miller should be promoting inclusivity and respect for all Texans, not spreading offensive memes that degrade marginalized communities,"" said Rachel Tiven, CEO of the LGBTQ Victory Fund. ""We demand that Miller take responsibility for his actions and apologize to the LGBTQ+ community.""
Miller's office has yet to comment on the situation, but the Agriculture Commissioner has a history of making controversial statements and promoting divisive policies. In 2017, Miller faced criticism for promoting a ""Don't Mess with Texas"" billboard that featured a photo of a same-sex couple, with the caption ""Support Traditional Marriage.""
As the debate continues to rage on, one thing is clear: the controversial Facebook post has sparked a larger conversation about inclusivity and respect in Texas politics. For many, the incident serves as a reminder that there is still much work to be done to ensure that all Texans are treated with dignity and respect."

In the past two weeks, after receiving a...“NOS” stands for “Novus Ordo Seclorum,” or New World Order. The O has been replaced with a transformed version of Obama’s campaign slogan, with the American flag replaced by flames. There is also an all-seeing eye in the center. It’s pretty clear what the agenda is of this traitor we knew was an American-hating globalist all along:Along with two small islands due east of Virginia just in international waters, Obama’s “team” has now set up massive complexes with billions in equipment and spying technology outside of Washington DC, New York and Los Angeles. Chicago would have been a better choice for population than Washington but if your end game is to launch a military coup in the nation’s capital, those pieces must be deeply embedded in place.How embedded? Obama himself lives within the city limits. He conducts secret meetings with top-ranking officials from both parties and diplomats from around the world in a mansion that is a part of the old Washington tunnel system, built after the British trashed the city and burned down the White House in 1812.The extent of the tunnels is unknown since they remain the property of the US Government and require codeword clearance. There is no map available. Historians have pieced together several of the stops, however, and Tracey Place — along with just about every other building that houses a public official in DC — is on the list.This is no joke, patriots. If Obama’s military comes to your door in yellow Humvees with that emblem on them, they aren’t your friends. Get out of the house and don’t look back. At some point, their population reduction plan will go into effect and older Trump supporters will be the first ones buried in mass graves.","This is a term used by some conspiracy theorists to describe a secret plan by powerful individuals and organizations to control the world. The “NOS” tattoo on Obama's wrist is believed to be a symbol of his loyalty to this plot.
As President of the United States, Barack Obama has always been a divisive figure. But now, in his retirement years, he has decided to take his plans for global domination to a new level. According to sources close to the former President, Obama has been secretly meeting with key figures in the New World Order, including billionaires, politicians, and other influential individuals.
The purpose of these meetings, according to these sources, is to finalize a coup against the United States government. Obama is believed to have been secretly building a network of loyal supporters within the government, military, and intelligence agencies, who will carry out his orders once the coup is underway.
The timing of Obama's plans could not be worse, coming as they do in the midst of a global pandemic and economic collapse. Many are speculating that Obama sees these crises as the perfect opportunity to seize power and establish a new world order, with himself at its helm.
As fear and uncertainty grip the nation, Obama's supporters are reportedly spreading propaganda and disinformation to justify their leader's actions. They claim that the coup is necessary to restore order and stability to a chaotic world, and that Obama is the only leader with the vision and experience to guide humanity through this difficult time.
But not everyone is buying it. Many are speaking out against Obama's plans, calling them a betrayal of the trust placed in him by the American people. They point to his history of controversial policies and actions, and argue that he has always been more interested in advancing his own agenda than in serving the interests of the United States.
As the situation continues to unfold, one thing is clear: the United States is on the brink of a constitutional crisis, and the fate of the nation hangs in the balance."

politifact14992,1,1,"Do you really believe that as the countries of the Middle East empty out, and their degenerates are vomited out upon the Western World, ...","Title: 'Exodus of Degenerates' Sparks Fears of Western Decline
LONDON - The sudden and unprecedented exodus of individuals from the Middle East has sparked concerns among Western leaders and experts about the potential decline of their respective societies. As countries in the region experience unrest and political upheaval, a flood of ""degenerates"" has been pouring into the West, posing a challenge to the social fabric of these nations.
According to a recent report by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), over 100,000 migrants from the Middle East have entered Europe alone in the past year, with many more expected to follow. This influx has led to a surge in crime, violence, and social unrest in many Western cities, as these individuals struggle to adapt to their new surroundings.
""This is a ticking time bomb,"" warned a senior government official in an interview with CNN. ""We are seeing a fundamental shift in the demographics of our society, and it's not clear how this will play out in the long term.""
The influx of migrants has also raised questions about the cultural and religious identity of the West, with many fearing that the arrival of large numbers of Muslims and other non-Western groups will erode the traditional values and beliefs of these societies.
""We are seeing a gradual erosion of our cultural and religious identity,"" said a prominent sociologist in an interview with The New York Times. ""As more and more migrants arrive, it's not clear what the future of our society will look like.""
While some experts argue that the influx of migrants can provide a much-needed boost to the economy and cultural diversity of the West, others are more skeptical, pointing to the potential for social unrest and conflict.
""This is a complex issue that requires a thoughtful and nuanced approach,"" said a senior government official in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. ""We need to find a way to balance our humanitarian obligations with the need to preserve the social cohesion and stability of our societies.""
In the meantime, the exodus of degenerates from the Middle East is likely to continue, with many more migrants expected to arrive in the West in the coming years. As this trend continues, it remains to be seen how the West will adapt to this changing landscape and what the long-term implications will be for these societies."

A native-born family, the Bordens ran a mill in what became the town for generations before and after the American revolution. Industrialization began when Col.

""Fall River is a city that was built by immigrants, and it's a testament to the power of hard work, determination, and the American Dream,"" Kennedy said in his address. ""From the earliest settlers to the newest arrivals, immigrants have always been the backbone of this great nation. They are the ones who have built our cities, our industries, and our economy.

Kennedy's address was met with a standing ovation from the audience, which included members of the Fall River community, elected officials, and journalists from across the country. His words were seen as a powerful rebuke to President Trump's controversial immigration policies, which have been widely criticized as xenophobic and discriminatory.
In a statement issued after the address, Kennedy said, ""I am proud to represent a district that is home to so many hardworking and dedicated immigrants. They are the heart and soul of our community, and they deserve our respect, our gratitude, and our unwavering support.""
Kennedy's response to the State of the Union address was widely praised by immigration rights advocates and political analysts, who saw it as a bold and necessary challenge to the Trump administration's anti-immigrant agenda. ""Rep. Kennedy's speech was a powerful reminder of the importance of immigration to our country's history, economy, and society,"" said Angela Kelley, an immigration rights advocate and former senior advisor to President Barack Obama. ""He is a true champion for immigrant rights, and his leadership is more important than ever in these uncertain times."""

""He was found unresponsive in his cell by prison guards around 2 am,"" said a hospital spokesperson, who requested anonymity. ""We are not sure what happened yet, but he is receiving medical attention.""
Pistorius, 32, was sentenced to six years in prison for the murder of Steenkamp in 2013. He was released early after serving part of his sentence and has been undergoing therapy to deal with his mental health issues.

A groundbreaking ruling by the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) has ordered a major utility company to drastically reduce its white workforce within the next five years. According to the ruling, the company must cut its white employee numbers by 44.3% or face legal action and potential financial penalties.
The decision, which was handed down on Thursday, has sent shockwaves through the country's corporate sector, with many industry leaders expressing concern about the potential impact on South Africa's economy.
""This is a bold and unprecedented move by the SAHRC, and it will have far-reaching consequences for the country's business community,"" said economist and industry analyst, Dr. Makwena Molefi. ""The ruling will not only affect the utility company directly, but it will also set a precedent for other companies to follow.""
The utility company, which has not yet commented on the ruling, has been accused of failing to comply with the country's employment equity laws, which aim to promote racial and gender diversity in the workplace.
The SAHRC has insisted that the ruling is necessary to address the historical imbalances and inequalities that have persisted in South Africa's workplace for decades. ""We cannot afford to continue to perpetuate the injustices of the past,"" said SAHRC chairperson, Advocate Bongani Majola. ""We must take bold action to address the systemic barriers that have prevented marginalized groups from participating fully in the country's economic development.""
The utility company has been given until the end of next month to submit a detailed plan of action to the SAHRC, outlining how it intends to comply with the ruling. Failure to do so could result in legal action and potential financial penalties.
The ruling has sparked a heated debate about the role of affirmative action in South Africa's economy, with some arguing that it is necessary to address the legacy of apartheid, while others believe it is a form of reverse discrimination that undermines meritocracy and fairness.
Regardless of the outcome, one thing is clear: the SAHRC's ruling has sent a powerful message to South Africa's corporate sector: the days of unchecked privilege and discrimination are over, and all companies must now take steps to promote diversity and inclusion in their workplaces."

She quoted a December 2015 poll showing majority support for an “assault weapons” ban and said, “I’m with the majority today, taking a stand.”Interestingly, when confronted by Second Amendment supporters on Twitter, Carlson doubled down on her pro-ban stance, claiming that “the fact that you’re even using the Second Amendment as an argument against banning assault weapons shows me you’re ignorant.

Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedInGretchen Carlson is renewing her push for an AR-15 ban, firing off a series of tweets further criticizing the weapon that has been linked to numerous mass shootings. The former Fox News host, who has been a vocal advocate for stricter gun control measures, slammed the AR-15 as a ""weapon of war"" that has no place in civilian hands. Carlson called on lawmakers to take action to ban the weapon, which she described as ""a tool of death that has been used to slaughter innocent people.""
In her tweets, Carlson pointed to recent mass shootings, including the one in El Paso, Texas, that killed 22 people and injured dozens more. She argued that the AR-15 is a weapon of choice for mass shooters because of its high rate of fire and ability to inflict massive damage. Carlson also cited statistics showing that the AR-15 is the most commonly used weapon in mass shootings, and that it has been used in more than half of all mass shootings since 2011.
Carlson's calls for an AR-15 ban have been met with resistance from some gun rights advocates, who argue that such a ban would infringe on their Second Amendment rights. However, Carlson and other gun control advocates argue that the Second Amendment does not protect the right to own any weapon, including those designed for mass violence.
In conclusion, Gretchen Carlson is renewing her push for an AR-15 ban, citing the weapon's deadly role in numerous mass shootings and its status as a tool of death. While her calls for a ban have faced resistance, Carlson and other gun control advocates are determined to push for stricter gun control measures to prevent future tragedies."

""We understand that our fans enjoy a good time, and this is just one more way for them to enhance their game-day experience."" The team is also offering a limited edition ""420"" menu, which will feature additional cannabis-infused options such as edibles, drinks, and topicals. Fans will be able to purchase these items at designated concession stands throughout the stadium. The Rockies are not the first sports team to embrace the legalization of marijuana in Colorado, but they are the first to sell it at their games. The move is expected to bring in significant revenue for the team and the state. ""We are excited to be at the forefront of this new trend in sports and entertainment,"" said Rockies owner, John Jones. ""We believe that this will not only be a great addition to our game-day experience, but also a significant boost to our bottom line."" The Rockies will kick off their season this weekend, and fans are already buzzing about the new cannabis-infused treats. ""I can't wait to try the marijuana brownies,"" said fan, Tom Johnson.

As the trend continues to grow, it's clear that marijuana is becoming a major player in the world of sports and entertainment."

politifact13887,1,0,"Brian Kline is the type of person who voted for President Donald Trump in November. He’s a working-class man whose job is in retail, scoring him $11.66/hour. Thanks to Medicaid he’s being treated for cancer. During the CNN town hall with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, Kline explained his situation and his struggles. “My question is pretty straightforward,” Kline told Price. “Why do you want to take away my Medicaid expansion?” Price’s dispassionate answer seemed to fall flat on the audience. “I took care of a lot of patients with cancer,” Price explained about his 20 years as an orthopedic surgeon. “We don’t want to take care away from anybody. What we want to make certain, though, is that every single American has access to the kind of coverage and care that they want for themselves.”“But, what if there are people out there who are going to die more quickly because of what you’re doing here, because you’re essentially taking medical care away from people who need it the most?” Kline wouldn’t back down. “Are you saying you actually want people to be okay with that?” Price thought for a second, then replied: “Look, I understand how all of this sounds right now, but you know, there comes a time in everyone’s life when they just have to stop talking B.S. and be practical. As of right now, the fact to the matter is, our national budget is hemorrhaging money because of Obamacare. And believe me – I get how insensitive that sounds, but at the end of the day, we have to stop ignoring the facts here.”He continued, “I understand that this is not something anyone wants to hear, especially people who’ve got worse problems to deal with than the state of the national budget, but this is one of those situations where the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. When President Trump assumed office, he was appalled at the state of the national budget and our finances. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that Barack Obama was to blame, since he’s the one who left the hot potato behind for us to deal with. Now, I’m not going to go into whether or not he did that on purpose, but at the end of the day, all I can say is, we have to fix the problem or else we’re looking at nationwide riots and another economic recession.”“Put simply, we have to plug some holes – of which, by the way, there are plenty – and we kind of have to start with the biggest ones,” the orthopedic surgeon added. “Unfortunately for millions of people across the country, Obamacare seems to be the biggest one by far. Besides, there are more ways than one to look at this picture. I know it’s not pretty, but at the end of the day, even people who are able to fight off cancer – I’m sure you know what I’m talking about, Brian – they can’t lead 100 percent normal lives, ever again. What kind of an existence is that, to have to survive instead of live?”“At the risk of sounding insensitive, we’ve pretty much got two choices here: we either repeal Obamacare, or we take out more loans from countries like China. And nobody wants to be in debt to the Chinese. At the end of the day, it’s better for our national budget if cancer patients pass away more quickly, it’s a lousy way to live anyway, and I’m sorry to say it out loud, but it’s the truth,” Price concluded.","He’s 32, and is divorced.

As the United States of America continues to grapple with political turmoil and social unrest, a new development has emerged that threatens to further exacerbate the situation. Sources close to the US President, Donald Trump, have revealed that he is planning to issue an executive order to ban Facebook in the country. This move comes as a surprise to many, given the President's history of using social media to connect with his supporters and bypass traditional media outlets.
According to the sources, the President believes that Facebook has become a hotbed for fake news and propaganda, and that banning it will help to restore order and stability to the country. However, critics argue that this move will only serve to stifle free speech and undermine the democratic process.
The proposed executive order is expected to be signed within the next few days, and will reportedly apply to all social media platforms, not just Facebook. This means that Twitter, Instagram, and other popular social media sites may also be affected.
The reaction to this news has been mixed, with some people expressing concern about the potential impact on free speech and civil liberties, while others see it as a necessary measure to combat the spread of misinformation.
As the situation unfolds, it remains to be seen how this executive order will play out, and what the long-term consequences will be for the United States and its citizens. One thing is certain, however: the use of social media in the country is about to become a lot more complicated."

Title: Seattle Man's Gun Confiscated After Being Deemed 'Uncomfortable' and 'Unsafe'
Seattle, WA - A man has had his gun confiscated by police in Seattle after he was deemed ""uncomfortable"" and ""unsafe"" by a security guard while openly carrying his handgun in a public place. According to reports, the man, whose identity has not been released, was legally carrying his firearm in a Seattle shopping district when he was approached by a security guard. The guard reportedly asked the man to leave the area, citing concerns about his presence making others feel uncomfortable and unsafe.
Despite the man breaking no laws by carrying his gun, Seattle police were called to the scene and took the weapon away from him. ""We understand that some people may have concerns about gun ownership, but it's important to remember that there are places where it is legal and appropriate to carry firearms,"" said Seattle Police Department spokesperson, Detective John Smith. ""However, it's also important to be considerate of others and to respect their feelings and safety. In this case, the security guard had a legitimate concern and the police were called to address it.""
The man, who has not been identified, declined to comment on the incident. ""I just want to move on from this and focus on my rights as a gun owner,"" he said.
The incident has sparked a renewed debate about gun rights and the balance between individual freedoms and public safety. ""This is a classic example of how difficult it can be to navigate the complexities of gun laws and cultural attitudes,"" said local political analyst, James Johnson. ""While some people see gun ownership as a fundamental right, others see it as a threat to their safety and well-being. It's a challenge that lawmakers and citizens will continue to face in the coming years.""
In Washington state, it is legal to openly carry a handgun in public, as long as the carrier is not prohibited from possessing a firearm. However, local businesses and public spaces can establish their own rules regarding firearms on their property. The security guard who asked the man to leave cited these rules as the reason for his action.
The man's gun has been turned over to the police and is being held as evidence while the incident is investigated. No further details have been released."

An unknown portion of these voters may have had their minds controlled by a Russian space-beam, agents close to the investigation say.The allegation that 62 million Americans appear to be employed by Russian intelligence services has rocked the Bureau, and it is reported that multiple agents have taken their own lives, given that realizing just how deep this Russian hacking conspiracy runs blew their minds — literally.This shocking new revelation comes after it was confirmed as a fact that Russia did Wikileaks because Donald Trump personally called Vladimir Putin and asked him to. It was also revealed earlier this week that Alex Jones (real name “Alexi Jonesinov”) is a Russian sleeper agent who was ordered by the FSB (formerly the KGB) to post news articles on the internet saying that Donald Trump would be a good President.However, the revelation that 62 million Americans are taking orders directly from the Kremlin is a revelation of a whole other order, which FBI agents are struggling with how to deal with.It was determined by Puerto Rican federal judge Mizu Tomazaki that it is a crime to support Donald Trump or to post positive things about him on the internet. 9th circuit judges Weinberg, Steinman and Goldenstein upheld the ruling. Despite this, the logistics of rounding up 62 million people and locking them in prison present a difficult task to overcome.It may also be that not every voter is a direct agent of the FSB (formerly the KGB), and some may have been under the control of a mind control beam in space.“We have not determined for sure that everyone who voted for Trump was paid directly by the Kremlin, given that it is highly possible that the Russians used a space-beam from a satellite to control their brains from a facility in St. Petersburg, and moved their bodies like puppets to the polls to check the Trump box,” one current agent familiar with the investigation told the times, describing the process of using a satellite-mounted space-beam to control people’s actions as “Russian neuro-brain hacking.”When asked for comment on these reports by The Times, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the allegations of space-beam mind control by the FSB (formerly the KGB) were “ridiculous,” “outrageous” and “goofy.” However, Peskov suspiciously asked “vere is Moose and Squirrel?”NSA chief Mike Rogers said that though it is a well-established fact that going all the way back to Soviet times, the Russians have used space-beams to control people’s brains, he’s “never seen anything on this scale before.”The Times also sought comment from President Trump; however, when asked about these allegations, he began screaming in Russian and jumped in a big truck and drove off down the road.You are all nuts…almost 1/2 of America voted to make Trump the legal president, and you keep teling us we don’t matter.

The poll, conducted among 1,000 registered voters, shows that 48% of Americans approve of Trump's job performance, while 47% disapprove.
This is a significant improvement for Trump, who had a rocky start to his presidency and faced intense scrutiny over his controversial policies and actions. However, as the poll suggests, Trump's popularity has been steadily rising, particularly among Republicans, who make up a majority of his supporters.
In comparison, Obama had an approval rating of 47% at the same point in his presidency, while Reagan had a rating of 44%.

According to astronomers, the celestial bodies are set to collide this month, causing a catastrophic event that could have devastating consequences for our planet.
While some have dismissed the predictions as mere fantasy, experts have warned that the impending collision could lead to widespread destruction and chaos. The impact is expected to cause massive earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions, leaving countless lives in ruins.

Instead of having an entertainment center, it is now easy to mount your TV and speakers on the wall, leaving more space for things you can’t compromise with.Multi-functional FurnitureIn a tiny house, a bed doesn’t have the luxury to be just a bed. It needs to perform multiple functions, where storage is one of the most important ones. The same applies to coffee and night tables, sofas and kitchen elements. Beds can have drawers for your linens, or room for storage under their mattress. Instead of a regular coffee table, opt in for a cube design, where multiple storage drawers are integrated for all those small things you don’t have space for.Customized FurnitureSometimes it is difficult to furnish a tiny home, especially if it doesn’t use a standard floor plan. Customized furniture is a huge advantage in tiny homes, where space is at a premium. You can make sure that every single corner and nook of your house can be used in a functional way. The same applies to storage. A well-placed shelf or locker, can perform a very important function while not taking up much space or by utilizing and otherwise unused space. Customized furniture does come at a premium price, but it is one of those investments you will not lose any sleep over once you are living in your tiny home.Tiny AppliancesEvery piece of furniture and appliance you put into your tiny home, will make you compromise on something else. Tiny living is about downsizing your living space to bare necessities but that has a different meaning for different people. In order to create more space for storing stuff you can’t live without, making some sacrifices when it comes to appliances is important. Instead of a full-sized stove, opt in for a dual heat-plate design that will take up less space. A small refrigerator works fine, just like a large two-door model. Also shopping more frequently for fresh groceries will lead you to a healthier lifestyle and diet. A fold out dinning-table in the kitchen, saves you the space that you might need for a dining table. Tiny appliances and gadgets do tend to have a higher price than standard ones, but they provide so much more than function to tiny home dwellers.","Title: The Surprising Benefits of Living in a Regular-Sized Home
Subtitle: Say Goodbye to Clutter and Hello to More Space
In a world where bigger is often seen as better, a new study has found that living in a regular-sized home with plenty of space for closets, lockers, and shelves has surprising benefits. According to the study, people who live in smaller homes are less likely to experience clutter and disorganization, and are more likely to have a sense of calm and well-being in their living space.
The study, conducted by the University of California, surveyed over 1,000 adults who lived in homes ranging from small to large. The researchers found that those who lived in smaller homes were more likely to report feeling organized and in control of their living space, and were less likely to experience feelings of stress and anxiety.
""We were surprised to find that the size of a person's home was such a strong predictor of their sense of organization and well-being,"" said Dr. Sarah Johnson, lead author of the study. ""It's common to assume that bigger is better, but our findings suggest that for many people, living in a smaller home can be a key factor in achieving a more peaceful and organized living space.""
The study also found that people who lived in smaller homes were more likely to use their available space more efficiently, with many reporting the use of creative storage solutions such as wall-mounted shelves, under-bed storage containers, and hanging organizers.
""Living in a smaller home forces you to be more mindful of how you use your space,"" said Mary Smith, a 35-year-old mother of two who lives in a 1,200 square foot home. ""I've learned to be more efficient with my storage, and I feel much more in control of my living space.""
The findings of the study have important implications for homeowners and policymakers alike, suggesting that smaller homes may be a more sustainable and practical option for many people, particularly in urban areas where space is at a premium.
""As cities continue to grow and densify, it's important to consider the impact of home size on well-being and sustainability,"" said Dr. Johnson. ""Our findings suggest that smaller homes may be a more sustainable option for many people, particularly in urban areas where space is limited.""
In conclusion, the surprising benefits of living in a regular-sized home with plenty of space for closets, lockers, and shelves are a game-changer for many people. By choosing a smaller home, individuals can experience a greater sense of organization and well-being, while also contributing to more sustainable and practical urban planning."

In an emergency meeting on Thursday, the city council held an emergency meeting to initiate impeachment proceedings which begin on Monday.Donald Trump has helped Puerto Rico and other hurricane-affected areas much more efficiently than any previous President, and Puerto Rico needs to replace their leadership with someone who understands and appreciates that before they lose the aid we aren’t even required to give them.","In response to the president's latest threat, the mayor of San Juan, Carmen Yulín Cruz, announced on Wednesday that she will be sharing the aid that the federal government has been withholding from the city with other communities in need across the country. This decision comes after weeks of pleading with the Trump administration to release the aid that was promised to the city after Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico last September.Despite the president's repeated claims that Puerto Rico is being treated fairly, the mayor has been vocal about the inadequate support the city has received from the federal government. In an interview with CNN, Cruz stated, “We are not going to be used as a political football. We are not going to be used to fuel the president’s ego or to fuel his base. We are going to continue to fight for our people.”According to sources close to the situation, the mayor has been working behind the scenes to coordinate the distribution of the aid to other communities in need. While the exact details of the plan have not been made public, it is believed that the aid will be distributed to areas affected by recent natural disasters, including California, Texas, and Florida.While the move has been praised by many, it has also been met with criticism from some who argue that the aid should be going directly to the people of Puerto Rico. However, Cruz has made it clear that the aid is intended to support the long-term recovery efforts in Puerto Rico, and that the city will continue to fight for the support it needs to rebuild and recover from the devastating hurricane.As the debate over the aid continues, one thing is clear: the people of Puerto Rico will not be ignored. The mayor's decision to share the aid with other communities in need is a powerful statement about the importance of solidarity and compassion in the face of disaster."

The news outlet said chants by monument supporters included “Where’s Mitch?” while opponents chanted, “Hey hey, ho ho, white supremacy has got to go.”As Fox news reported earlier, the mayor’s plan calls for the Davis statue to be melted down and cast into smaller statues of Black Lives Matter leaders.","By Julie Barker, Reporter
NEW ORLEANS – Workers in New Orleans successfully dismantled the city’s Jefferson Davis monument early Thursday, marking a significant step forward in the city’s ongoing efforts to eradicate Confederate symbols. The statue, which had stood for more than 100 years, was removed without incident, with workers using cranes and other heavy machinery to carefully dismantle the structure.
The monument, located in the city’s Lee Circle, was erected in 1911 to honor Jefferson Davis, the first and only President of the Confederate States of America. However, in recent years, the statue has become a source of controversy, with many arguing that it represents a painful reminder of the city’s history of slavery and racism.
The decision to remove the monument was made in 2015 by the New Orleans City Council, following a wave of protests and calls for the statue’s removal. Since then, the city has worked closely with local historians and preservationists to ensure that the monument is removed in a responsible and respectful manner.
“This is a major milestone in our efforts to confront and overcome our city’s troubled history,” said New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu in a statement. “The removal of this statue is a significant step towards a more inclusive and equitable future for all New Orleanians.”
The statue will be stored in a secure location until a final decision is made on its fate, with some calling for the statue to be placed in a museum or other educational setting, while others argue that it should be destroyed.
The removal of the Jefferson Davis monument is the latest in a series of efforts to remove Confederate symbols from public spaces in New Orleans, following the removal of several other statues and monuments in recent years. The city’s efforts have been praised by many as a necessary step towards healing and reconciliation, while others have criticized them as an attack on Confederate heritage.
Regardless of one’s perspective on the issue, it is clear that the removal of the Jefferson Davis monument is a significant moment in New Orleans’ history, and marks a major step forward in the city’s ongoing efforts to confront and overcome its troubled past."
politifact15280,1,1,"A leaked Hillary Clinton email confirms that the Obama administration, with Hillary at the helm, orchestrated a civil war in Syria to benefit Israel.The new Wikileaks release shows the then Secretary of State ordering a war in Syria in order to overthrow the government and oust President Assad, claiming it was the “best way to help Israel”.Newobserveronline.com reports:The document was one of many unclassified by the US Department of State under case number F-2014-20439, Doc No. C05794498, following the uproar over Clinton’s private email server kept at her house while she served as Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013.Although the Wikileaks transcript dates the email as December 31, 2000, this is an error on their part, as the contents of the email (in particular the reference to May 2012 talks between Iran and the west over its nuclear program in Istanbul) show that the email was in fact sent on December 31, 2012.The email makes it clear that it has been US policy from the very beginning to violently overthrow the Syrian government—and specifically to do this because it is in Israel’s interests.“The best way to help Israel deal with Iran’s growing nuclear capability is to help the people of Syria overthrow the regime of Bashar Assad,” Clinton forthrightly starts off by saying.Even though all US intelligence reports had long dismissed Iran’s “atom bomb” program as a hoax (a conclusion supported by the International Atomic Energy Agency), Clinton continues to use these lies to “justify” destroying Syria in the name of Israel.She specifically links Iran’s mythical atom bomb program to Syria because, she says, Iran’s “atom bomb” program threatens Israel’s “monopoly” on nuclear weapons in the Middle East.If Iran were to acquire a nuclear weapon, Clinton asserts, this would allow Syria (and other “adversaries of Israel” such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt) to “go nuclear as well,” all of which would threaten Israel’s interests.Therefore, Clinton, says, Syria has to be destroyed.Iran’s nuclear program and Syria’s civil war may seem unconnected, but they are. What Israeli military leaders really worry about — but cannot talk about — is losing their nuclear monopoly.An Iranian nuclear weapons capability would not only end that nuclear monopoly but could also prompt other adversaries, like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, to go nuclear as well. The result would be a precarious nuclear balance in which Israel could not respond to provocations with conventional military strikes on Syria and Lebanon, as it can today.If Iran were to reach the threshold of a nuclear weapons state, Tehran would find it much easier to call on its allies in Syria and Hezbollah to strike Israel, knowing that its nuclear weapons would serve as a deterrent to Israel responding against Iran itself.It is, Clinton continues, the “strategic relationship between Iran and the regime of Bashar Assad in Syria” that makes it possible for Iran to undermine Israel’s security.This would not come about through a “direct attack,” Clinton admits, because “in the thirty years of hostility between Iran and Israel” this has never occurred, but through its alleged “proxies.”The end of the Assad regime would end this dangerous alliance. Israel’s leadership understands well why defeating Assad is now in its interests.Bringing down Assad would not only be a massive boon to Israel’s security, it would also ease Israel’s understandable fear of losing its nuclear monopoly.Then, Israel and the United States might be able to develop a common view of when the Iranian program is so dangerous that military action could be warranted.Clinton goes on to asset that directly threatening Bashar Assad “and his family” with violence is the “right thing” to do:In short, the White House can ease the tension that has developed with Israel over Iran by doing the right thing in Syria.With his life and his family at risk, only the threat or use of force will change the Syrian dictator Bashar Assad’s mind.The email prov","A leaked Hillary Clinton email has confirmed long-standing rumors that the Obama administration, with Clinton at the helm, orchestrated a civil war in Syria to benefit Israel. The email, which was among a batch of hacked emails released last week, suggests that the administration deliberately funneled arms and support to extremist groups in Syria, with the goal of toppling the Assad regime. The email, which was sent in 2012, reads, ""We need to start a civil war in Syria to weaken the Assad regime and pave the way for a new government that is more friendly to Israel."" The revelation has sparked outrage among anti-war activists and Middle East experts, who argue that the administration's actions were illegal and reckless. ""This is a shocking admission of US intervention in a foreign conflict, and it raises serious questions about the Obama administration's motives and actions in Syria,"" said a spokesperson for the Anti-War Coalition. ""We demand a full investigation into these allegations and accountability for those responsible."" The news comes as no surprise to those who have been following the Syrian conflict closely, as rumors of US involvement in the conflict have been circulating for years. However, the email's confirmation of US involvement in the conflict has raised the stakes and could have significant implications for US foreign policy in the region."

Washington D.C. - In a bold and controversial move, former President Barack Obama has been secretly meeting with prospective Democrat 2020 hopefuls, sources close to the matter have revealed. This move has sparked outrage among current administration officials, who view it as a direct violation of protocol and a blatant attempt to undermine the current administration's agenda.
According to multiple sources, Obama has been holding clandestine meetings with several high-profile Democrats, including California Senator Kamala Harris, former Vice President Joe Biden, and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. The meetings, which have taken place in various locations around the country, have reportedly focused on strategizing how to regain the White House in the 2020 election.
The news of Obama's secret meetings has sent shockwaves through the political world, with many criticizing the former President for his actions. ""This is a clear breach of protocol and a blatant attempt to undermine the current administration,"" said Republican National Committee spokesperson Michael McAdams. ""It's unfortunate that Obama is resorting to such underhanded tactics to further his own political agenda.""
However, not everyone is critical of Obama's actions. ""It's perfectly natural for a former President to want to stay involved in the political process and help shape the future of their party,"" said political analyst David Gergen. ""While some may view this as a violation of protocol, I think it's a sign of Obama's continued commitment to public service.""
The news of Obama's meetings comes at a time of increased tensions between the current and former Presidential administrations. In recent months, President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized Obama, accusing him of illegally spying on his campaign and of failing to properly vet immigrants from terror-linked countries.
Despite the controversy, it is clear that Obama is determined to play a major role in shaping the future of the Democratic Party. As one source close to the former President put it, ""Barack Obama is not going to sit idly by while the current administration undermines the progress he made during his time in office. He's going to fight for what he believes in, no matter the cost.""
In the coming months, it will be interesting to see how Obama's actions impact the 2020 election and the future of the Democratic Party. One thing is certain, however: the political landscape has changed, and Obama is not going to be ignored."

This prompted Trump to send a massive warning to Obama and his deep state minions that they won’t soon forget!Mad World News reported that Obama just jetted off to New Zealand this week, and he immediately imposed a strict ban on the media covering the events he plans to hold there. It should come as no surprise that Obama chose to leave the country right now, however, as the heat was just turned up on his deep state after the firing of now former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.In the wake of this firing, it was confirmed that Obama left behind a trail of damning evidence inside the Oval Office. The evidence proves that it was actually the Obama administration that colluded with Russia to thwart then-candidate Donald Trump during the presidential election, and they didn’t cover their tracks well enough.The members of Obama’s deep state that took part in this plan included ormer FBI Director James Comey, former National Security Advisor Susan Rice, former UN Ambassador Samantha Powers, and Lisa Monaco, who was the head of the DOJ National Security Division. Monaco slipped up and left an evidence trail going from the illegal unmasking of US citizens being done, Trump and his campaign people, under the illegal FISA warrants, back to the Oval Office via the “Presidential Daily Briefings” (PDB).“During the 2015/2016 presidential election, Lisa Monaco was one of the key WH figures doing the unmasking of raw intelligence provided by the ‘small group’ collaborators (with Susan Rice, Ben Rhodes). Monaco was also one of the key policy strategists, heck, she was the architect, who utilized the compartmentalization of intelligence to hide the fingerprints of collaboration. This was the issue that initially stymied HSPCI Devin Nunes,” reported The Conservative Treehouse.Nunes eventually found Obama’s PDBs which have all the illegal FISA activity and other illegal spy games targeting Trump.“Nunes stated the intelligence product he reviewed was ‘not related to Russia, or the FBI Russian counter-intelligence investigation.’ So the product itself was likely a product for the President, that was not part of the ongoing FBI counter-intel product,” reported The Conservative Treehouse.These PDBs prove Obama was in on this from the very beginning, and he hasn’t stopped trying to take Trump down since then. Last month, Obama and his deep state set up a website called “National Security Action,” who says their mission is, “Under President Trump’s reckless leadership, the United States is weaker in the world, less safe, and more isolated. He is retreating from the world stage, undercutting the intelligence and law enforcement agencies that keep us safe, undermining the diplomacy that prevents wars, insulting our allies, attacking democratic traditions, and cozying up to dictators while abandoning America’s commitment to universal rights and human dignity.”These people are just trying to get Trump impeached so they can swoop in and take back the White House as soon as he is out of it.

According to sources close to the investigation, the warrant was issued after the FBI found evidence that President Trump had indeed ordered the illegal surveillance of his political opponents. The investigation, which began in March of last year, has been ongoing and has involved multiple agents and analysts working around the clock to gather evidence.

President Trump has been under increasing pressure in recent months over the allegations, which he has repeatedly denied. However, with the issuance of the warrant, it appears that the FBI has now made a criminal case against the President.

In a stunning display of partisan politics, Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-CA) has sparked controversy with her latest remarks, with many labeling her as one of the most unpleasant people to ever hold public office. Waters, a longtime fixture on Capitol Hill, has made a name for herself with her no-nonsense approach to politics, often speaking her mind without regard for political correctness.
While some have praised Waters for her unapologetic stance, others have decried her as a divisive figure who only serves to further polarize an already fractured political climate. ""Maxine Waters is a breath of fresh air in a sea of bland, cookie-cutter politicians,"" said one supporter. ""She speaks her mind and doesn't back down, even when it's unpopular. That's exactly what we need more of in Washington.""
However, detractors argue that Waters' unpleasantness is a liability, one that only serves to undermine the legitimacy of the political process. ""Waters' constant anger and hostility only serves to further alienate those who might otherwise be open to listening to her message,"" said one critic. ""Her approach may be refreshing to some, but it's also alienating and counterproductive. We need politicians who can work together and find common ground, not those who are more interested in scoring cheap points than in solving real problems.""

Foster’s death in 1993 had been ruled a suicide..With new evidence, Rep. Trey Gowdy successfully petitioned a federal judge to have the body of Vince Foster exhumed for autopsy. The body wasn’t autopsied before burial the first time, which aided in the theory of a cover-up. Forensic specialists examined the body last night at the Naval Hospital in Norfolk, Virginia, concluding that the cause of death for Mr. Foster should be changed from suicide to homicide..LT Col. James McFitting, head of the hospital’s forensics lab, told reporters in his office that Foster had not one but two gunshot wounds, both of which would have been fatal. There would be no way he could have pulled the trigger himself a second time.

Washington D.C. - In a move that has sparked widespread outrage, the recently passed tax bill has been met with fierce criticism from both sides of the political aisle. The bill, which was passed in a party-line vote, has been slammed as the single worst piece of legislation in the history of American politics.
""This bill is a disaster for working Americans,"" said Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). ""It gives massive tax cuts to the wealthy while hurting the very people who need it most.""
According to analysts, the bill will increase the national debt by over $1 trillion, while providing little relief to the middle class. ""The tax cuts for the wealthy are temporary, while the increases for the poor and middle class are permanent,"" said economist Paul Krugman. ""This is a recipe for economic disaster.""
Demonstrations against the bill have already erupted in cities across the country, with protesters calling for its repeal. ""This bill is an attack on the very fabric of our society,"" said organizer Sarah Jones. ""We cannot stand idly by while our elected officials sell out the American people.""
As the backlash against the bill grows, some lawmakers are beginning to reconsider their support. ""I never thought this bill would cause so much harm,"" said Representative Tim Ryan (D-OH). ""I will do everything in my power to repeal it.""
The tax bill has also sparked a renewed debate over the role of money in politics. ""This bill is a clear example of how big money has corrupted our political system,"" said campaign finance reform advocate Tom Udall. ""It's time for Americans to stand up and demand real change.""

politifact15334,1,1,"‘Smallville’ star Allison Mack has confessed that she sold children to the Rothschilds and Clintons during her time in the child sex cult.According to police, Allison Mack worked in a senior management position for the Hollywood pedophile cult NXIVM. As second-in-command, it was her job to lure children into the cult in order to sell them to elite Hollywood pedophiles and powerful politicians.Thefreethoughtproject.com reports: “As alleged in the indictment, Allison Mack recruited women to join what was purported to be a female mentorship group that was, in fact, created and led by Keith Raniere. The victims were then exploited, both sexually and for their labor, to the defendants’ benefit,” U.S. Attorney Richard P. Donoghue said in a statement.The cult was finally exposed when the daughter of former Dynasty actress Catherine Oxenberg became a member. Oxenberg told the New York Times that she became concerned after she saw that her 26-year-old daughter India was extremely emaciated from dieting, and was suffering from serious health problems.“Some people have said this is a voluntary sorority. The women I have spoken to tell a far different story,” Oxenberg said. “Coercion is not voluntary. Extortion is not voluntary. Blackmail is not voluntary.”When these accusations hit the news, other women, including actress Sarah Edmondson, came forward to all to tell the same story, of the blackmail, the branding, as well as the forced labor and forced sexual activity.Raniere is also accused of having a history of pedophilia, with accusations that stretch back over 20 years, involving girls as young as 12.In 2012, several women were interviewed by the Albany Times Union about the coercive sexual experiences that they had with Raniere when they were young girls. One of the women in the case was found dead of a gunshot wound before she was able to give the interview. Her death was ruled a suicide.The U.S. attorney’s office requested to have Raniere held without bail in a letter to the court stating that he was a known child predator.Although this extremely important detail is being left out of most mainstream reports, one of the main charges in the criminal indictment against Raniere and Mack is sex trafficking of children.A quick search for Allison Mack’s arrest report or charges—as reported by the mainstream media—will not yield any mention of children. Most mainstream reports only mention sex trafficking and ominously omit that the charges were for sex trafficking of children. Exactly why the media is refusing to report this remains a mystery.Another important aspect of this case that has been largely overlooked, is the connections that this organization has to high-level figures in politics and finance. The organization worked much like a pyramid scheme, collecting regular fees from its members. But the majority of the funding, over $150 million, came from the trust funds of Seagram heiresses, Sara and Clare Bronfman.Their involvement with Raniere began in 2002 and has been very public and controversial, with other members of the Bronfman family distancing themselves from the sisters in the press. The Bronfman family has very close ties to the Rothschild banking dynasty, with members of both families belonging to many of the same companies, including their joint financial firm, Bronfman & Rothschild.Additionally, at least three high-ranking members of the organization, including Nancy Salzman and the Bronfman sisters, are members of Bill Clinton’s foundation, the Clinton Global Initiative, which requires an annual $15,000 membership fee.Now that Raniere is in jail and Mack is on bail and ordered not to have any contact with other cult members, Clare Bronfman has taken on the role of leader within the organization.In response to the recent controversy surrounding NXIVM, Bronfman made a statement on her website denying the accusations against Raniere. She praised Raniere and the NXIVM programs, insisting that she is doing work that is tru","Subject: Allison Mack Admits to Selling Children to Powerful Elites

In a shocking turn of events, former ""Smallville"" star Allison Mack has confessed to selling children to powerful elites, including the Rothschilds and Clintons, during her time in a child sex cult. Mack, who was arrested in April for her involvement in the cult, made the admission during a recent interview with investigators.
According to Mack, she was recruited into the cult by its leader, Keith Raniere, who promised her fame and fortune in exchange for her participation in the cult's illegal activities. Mack claimed that she was forced to sell children to the elites in order to maintain her status within the cult.
The revelation has sent shockwaves through the entertainment industry and political circles, with many calling for immediate action to be taken against Mack and the other cult members. The Rothschilds and Clintons have yet to comment on the allegations.
Mack's admission comes as no surprise to those who have been following the story of the child sex cult, which has been operating for years under the radar of law enforcement. The cult, known as NXIVM, has been accused of using coercion, blackmail, and manipulation to keep its members in line.
This latest revelation only serves to highlight the depths of depravity to which some individuals will go to achieve power and wealth. The safety and well-being of children must be our top priority, and those who prey on them must be held accountable for their actions.
As the investigation into NXIVM continues, it is clear that the truth will only come to light through the courage of individuals like Allison Mack who are willing to speak out against the cult's evil practices."
politifact15625,1,0,"San Juan mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz’s party are facing fraud charges relating to the embezzlement of over $3 million in federal funds, just months after she appeared on CNN and blamed President Trump for mishandling the Puerto Rico hurricane disaster response.Despite the fact that the U.S. government sent emergency workers, supplies and billions of dollars to the territory, its Democrat-allied politicians still pointed a finger at the president — and the left-leaning mainstream media happily spread the “blame Trump” narrative.As comparisons to George W. Bush and Hurricane Katrina grew, figures like San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz attacked Trump for supposedly mishandling the disaster response, despite the fact that emergency management experts praised the president and FEMA’s actions.“What is really nasty is that anyone would turn their back on the Puerto Rican people,” Yulín Cruz declared at the time, even wearing a T-shirt labeled “NASTY” — where did she get it during a major storm? — as part of a petty jab at the U.S. president.Liberals across the United States, glued to CNN, cheered the San Juan mayor and declared her a national hero. “We are dying, and you (Trump) are killing us with the inefficiency and the bureaucracy,” she said during a television conference in early October.Western Journal reports: Fast forward to this week. It turns out that sure enough, there was plenty of “inefficiency and bureaucracy” in Puerto Rico … but it looks like the island’s own liberal politicians were likely the ones behind it.According to the Associated Press, a Puerto Rican mayor and two additional island officials have now been charged with corruption.Although the alleged crimes go back before Hurricane Maria made landfall in the Caribbean, the arrests paint a dire picture of widespread corruption and misuse of government funds during the same general time frame as the disaster.“The suspects are the mayor of the southwest town of Sabana Grande and the former directors of finance for the northern town of Toa Baja,” the AP reported.“U.S. Attorney Rosa Emilia Rodriguez told reporters that the former officials from Toa Baja are accused of using nearly $5 million worth of federal funds to pay the town’s public employees and municipal contractors,” the newswire continued.“Not only is that illegal, it’s immoral,” Rodriguez added.Puerto Rico officials are accused of taking millions of dollars that was granted by the United States for assistance programs and re-directing it wherever they saw fit, such as taking $2.5 million from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and using it to pay town employees.At the center of the illegal scheme is Miguel Ortiz Vélez, who served as mayor. Ortiz Vélez belongs to the Popular Democratic Party, which is affiliated with the more well-known Democrat party in the mainland United States.Guess who else belongs to the same liberal PDP political group: Carmen Yulín Cruz, the person who was blaming Trump for hurricane deaths while her own party was defrauding taxpayers and laundering aid money. Is anyone surprised?There may be more arrests to follow, as well. Government officials said that more corruption is suspected, and additional Puerto Rican officials are under scrutiny.“Rodriguez said the investigation into alleged corruption in Toa Baja is ongoing because officials believe other people are involved,” the AP confirmed.The hurricane that devastated Puerto Rico was certainly a tragedy, and many lessons about disaster preparedness can be learned from that incident.However, it’s abundantly clear that widespread corruption and incompetence in Puerto Rico was a major part of the chaos. That corruption doesn’t point to Donald Trump … it leads right to the same leftist Democrats who were trying to point fingers the entire time.","San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz’s party is facing fraud charges relating to the embezzlement of over $3 million in federal funds, according to court documents unsealed Thursday. The charges come just months after the mayor appeared on CNN and blamed President Trump for mishandling the Puerto Rico hurricane disaster response.
The charges against Cruz and her party were brought by the Puerto Rico Department of Justice and allege that they misappropriated funds intended for hurricane relief and recovery efforts. According to the indictment, Cruz and her party used the funds for personal gain, including purchasing luxury items and paying for lavish vacations.
The allegations have sparked outrage in Puerto Rico and beyond, with many calling for Cruz's resignation. ""It's unconscionable that a public official would betray the trust of the people in this way,"" said Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló in a statement. ""We will not stand for corruption or abuse of power.""
Cruz has yet to comment on the charges, but her party has denied any wrongdoing. ""These allegations are baseless and politically motivated,"" said a spokesperson for Cruz's party. ""We will fight these charges and clear the mayor's name.""
The charges against Cruz come at a difficult time for Puerto Rico, which is still recovering from the devastating impact of Hurricane Maria in 2017. The island is facing a deep economic crisis, with many residents struggling to access basic necessities like food and water.
The scandal has raised questions about the island's political leadership and the ability of the government to effectively address the island's many challenges. ""This is a dark day for Puerto Rico,"" said a local political analyst. ""The island needs strong, ethical leaders who will prioritize the needs of the people over personal gain. This scandal only serves to further erode trust in government."""

The Pope, who has been a vocal advocate for gun control, made the announcement in a televised address to the world's Catholic bishops. ""We must take bold action to protect the innocent and prevent further bloodshed,"" the Pope said. ""The time has come for the nations of the world to recognize that the proliferation of guns is a threat to all of humanity, and to work together to remove this threat."" The Pope's call for global gun confiscation has sparked both praise and criticism, with some hailing it as a brave and necessary move, while others have denounced it as an attack on their Second Amendment rights. The United Nations has issued a statement in support of the Pope's call, saying that it ""fully endorses the Holy Father's efforts to promote peace and security around the world."" In related news, the Vatican has announced that it will be establishing a special task force to oversee the implementation of the Pope's gun confiscation plan. The task force, which will be led by Cardinal Dolan, will work with governments and international organizations to ensure that the plan is carried out in a fair and effective manner. The Pope's call for global gun confiscation is the latest in a series of initiatives aimed at promoting peace and security around the world. In recent years, the Vatican has also called for the establishment of a global authority to regulate the trade in small arms and the implementation of a comprehensive nuclear disarmament program. The Pope's address to the bishops was met with applause and cheers, as he urged the world's Catholic leaders to work together to achieve his vision of a more peaceful and secure world."

George Soros, the billionaire investment banker, has been accused of manipulating financial markets in multiple countries, including Asia, the UK, Greece, and Russia. In a shocking admission, Soros has admitted to using his vast wealth and influence to sway financial markets in his favor.
The news has sent shockwaves through the financial world, with many calling for his immediate resignation. ""Soros' actions are a clear violation of market integrity and undermine the trust in our financial system,"" said a spokesperson for the International Monetary Fund.
Soros' tactics have been under scrutiny for years, with many accusing him of using his hedge fund, Soros Fund Management, to manipulate currency markets. However, his latest admissions take his actions to a whole new level.
The billionaire investor has yet to comment on the allegations, but his silence has only added fuel to the fire. Many are calling for a full-scale investigation into Soros' actions, and some are even calling for criminal charges.
As the situation unfolds, it remains to be seen how Soros will handle the fallout from these latest allegations. One thing is for sure, however: this scandal has the potential to rock the very foundations of the financial world."
politifact15146,1,0,"The Democrats mulling a run for the White House in 2020 are facing intense pressure from liberals to campaign on abolishing the agency that enforces federal immigration laws, a proposal that was once relegated to the far-left fringe.In protesting the Trump administration’s policies toward illegal immigration, liberal commentators and writers have been embracing the idea of gutting the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, which identifies, arrests and deports illegal immigrants inside the United States.“This is a growing position on the left, and I imagine 2020 Democratic presidential aspirants will have to grapple with it,” liberal writer and MSNBC host Chris Hayes tweeted.In January, the idea was endorsed by Brian Fallon, a former top aide to 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and Eric Holder, President Barack Obama’s attorney general. The Daily Caller first drew attention to the calls.“ICE operates as an unaccountable deportation force,” Fallon tweeted. “Dems running in 2020 should campaign on ending the agency in its current form.”Thomas Homan, the acting director of ICE, has reacted to these calls by Democrats by saying they should speak to victims of illegal immigrant crime.“These politicians, they need to talk to the victims of alien crime, talk to the parents that I talk to that lost children at the hands of criminal aliens,” Homan said Thursday on Fox News’ “Tucker Carlson Tonight.”But the idea has picked up steam in recent days after Hayes, the MSNBC host, asked Democratic California Sen. Kamala Harris if she believes ICE should exist.“ICE has a purpose, ICE has a role, ICE should exist,” Harris, a potential 2020 candidate, responded. “But let’s not abuse the power.”Since then, Harris, the former attorney general of California, has faced a backlash from liberal publications.“Kamala Harris is very likely running for president in 2020,” Jack Mirkinson of the liberal Splinter website wrote. “It should be a political problem for her that she is not willing to take her criticisms of ICE to their logical conclusion and call for its abolition.”He added: “She should be asked, over and over again, why exactly she is willing to uphold the legitimacy of such a racist, corrupt, and thuggish organization.”Mirkinson wrote that other potential candidates -- like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti -- “should be asked the same question.”PELOSI SLAMS CALIFORNIA ICE RAID AS ‘UNJUST AND CRUEL’The Nation, a liberal magazine, last week also published an article titled “It’s Time to Abolish ICE.” The writer accused the agency of being part of an “unbridled white-supremacist surveillance state” and called it “an unaccountable strike force executing a campaign of ethnic cleansing.”“Though the party has moved left on core issues -- from reproductive rights to single-payer health care -- it’s time for progressives to put forward a demand that deportation be taken not as the norm, but rather as a disturbing indicator of authoritarianism,” McElwee wrote.Democratic officeholders also have been openly rebelling against ICE, including Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, who recently tipped off the public to an immigration raid in the San Francisco Bay Area.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., last week slammed that raid as ""unjust and cruel.""Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in a speech in California last week, said as many as 800 illegal immigrants may have evaded capture and said Schaff’s tip-off put both residents and law enforcement at risk.SESSIONS UNLOADS ON CALIFORNIA DEMS FOR ‘RADICAL, OPEN BORDERS AGENDA’Sessions called California’s ""open borders"" policies a “radical, irrational idea that cannot be accepted.”“It cannot be the policy of a great nation to reward those who unlawfully enter its country with legal status, Social Security, welfare, food stamps, and work permits and so forth,” he said. “How can this be a sound polic","Title: Democrats Under Pressure to Abolish Immigration Enforcement Agency
Washington D.C. - In a stunning turn of events, the Democratic party is facing mounting pressure from its far-left flank to campaign on abolishing the agency responsible for enforcing federal immigration laws. This proposal, once considered a fringe idea, has gained significant traction in recent months as the party's 2020 presidential hopefuls face increasing scrutiny from progressive activists and voters.
According to sources within the party, several high-profile Democrats are now seriously considering a run for the White House in 2020, and are being pushed to adopt more radical stances on immigration in order to win the support of their base. At the forefront of this movement is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the 29-year-old freshman congresswoman who has emerged as a leading voice on the left.
""We cannot continue to allow this agency to operate with impunity, separating families and deporting innocent people,"" Ocasio-Cortez told a crowd of protesters outside the White House earlier this week. ""It's time for a fundamental rethinking of our immigration policies, and abolishing ICE is the first step.""
While some Democrats have expressed reservations about the proposal, citing concerns about public safety and national security, many others see it as a necessary step towards creating a more just and humane immigration system.
""Abolishing ICE would be a game-changer for our country,"" said Senator Elizabeth Warren, a potential 2020 candidate. ""It would allow us to rebuild our immigration system from the ground up, with a focus on compassion, fairness, and respect for the dignity of all people.""
The pressure on Democrats to take a bold stance on immigration comes as President Trump's administration continues to face criticism for its controversial policies, including the separation of families at the border and the detention of migrant children in inhumane conditions. With the 2020 election looming, the party is under pressure to present a clear and united front on this issue, and the fate of ICE may be a key battleground in the coming months."

Washington D.C. - In a stunning turn of events, the Supreme Court of the United States has sided with President Donald Trump in a major victory for the White House. In a ruling that has sent shockwaves through the political establishment, the Court has upheld the President's controversial travel ban targeting predominantly Muslim countries.
The decision, which was handed down early this morning, marks a significant victory for the Trump administration and a major setback for the mainstream media, which has been fiercely critical of the President's travel ban. The Court's ruling is a clear indication that the President's executive order, which was signed in September, is constitutional and within his authority as the Commander-in-Chief.
""This is a major victory for the President and a significant blow to the left-leaning media outlets that have been attacking him non-stop,"" said a senior administration official. ""The President's travel ban is a necessary measure to protect the American people from the threat of terrorism and we are glad that the Court has recognized this.""
The decision is likely to further embolden the President and his administration, who have been under attack from the media and the political left since the beginning of his presidency. The President has been steadfast in his defense of his travel ban, arguing that it is necessary to protect the country from the threat of terrorism.
The ruling is also likely to have significant implications for the President's immigration policies, which have been a central focus of his administration. The President has made no secret of his desire to crack down on illegal immigration and the Supreme Court's ruling is likely to give him additional legal ammunition to do so.
The decision is likely to be met with anger and dismay from the political left, who have been fiercely critical of the President's travel ban. Protesters and activists are expected to take to the streets in the coming days to express their outrage and disbelief at the Court's ruling.
In a statement, the President praised the Court's decision, saying ""Today's ruling is a major victory for the American people and a clear vindication of my administration's position on the travel ban. I am grateful to the Court for recognizing the constitutionality of my executive order and for standing up to the left-leaning media outlets that have been attacking me non-stop.""
The Supreme Court's ruling is a significant shift in the political landscape, and is likely to have far-reaching implications for the President's agenda and the future of the country."

Addressing his followers in a sermon at St. Peter's Basilica, the Pope stated that the two sacred texts are ""not two separate paths, but one single journey towards the same God.""
""The Koran and the Holy Bible are not enemies, but friends,"" the Pope emphasized, ""for they both speak of the same God, the same love, and the same compassion."" He went on to say that the differences between the two texts are not fundamental, but rather a reflection of the diversity of human experience and understanding.
The Pope's statement has been met with widespread acclaim and support from religious leaders and scholars around the world. ""This is a momentous day in the history of interfaith dialogue,"" said Imam Mohamed Ali, a prominent Islamic scholar. ""The Pope's message of unity and mutual respect is a beacon of hope for a world torn apart by conflict and division.""
The Pope's message has also been endorsed by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who hailed it as a ""game-changer"" in the quest for global peace and understanding. ""The Pope's words have the power to inspire a new era of cooperation and coexistence among the world's religions,"" he said.

The conference will bring together religious leaders and scholars from around the world to discuss the ways in which the different faiths can learn from and support one another.

The New York Times, one of the most respected news organizations in the world, has revealed that it had no idea in 1984 that a piece it published on an upcoming billionaire would eventually resurface as confirmation of President Trump's perfect fit for this time in America. According to sources within the Times, the article, which was published in the newspaper's Sunday magazine, took a deep dive into the life of a then-little-known businessman named Donald Trump.
At the time, Trump was a controversial figure, known for his brash business tactics and outspoken views on everything from real estate to politics. But little did the Times know that their profile of Trump would one day become a prophetic look into the future of American politics.
As the years passed, Trump's political career began to take off, and he eventually became the President of the United States. And while many were surprised by his victory, the Times' 1984 profile of Trump offers a fascinating glimpse into why he was able to connect with so many Americans.
Through interviews with Trump's friends, family, and business associates, the Times piece painted a picture of a man who was both fiercely independent and intensely driven. And while some of Trump's views may have been seen as controversial at the time, the article also highlighted his ability to connect with people from all walks of life.
""Trump has a unique ability to see the world through other people's eyes,"" one of his friends was quoted as saying in the article. ""He understands what makes people tick, and he knows how to connect with them on a deep level.""
Fast forward to today, and it's clear that Trump's ability to connect with people has been a major factor in his political success. From his unconventional campaign rallies to his controversial Twitter feed, Trump has consistently found ways to engage with Americans in a way that many of his predecessors could not.
Of course, not everyone is a fan of Trump's unorthodox approach to politics. But for those who have followed his career from the beginning, the Times' 1984 profile offers a fascinating look into the mind of a man who was destined for greatness.
As one of Trump's former business associates was quoted as saying in the article, ""Trump has always been a man ahead of his time. And when it comes to understanding the pulse of America, he's still the only one who really gets it."""

by 5844f506
As the Alabama Senate race heats up, a bombshell revelation has rocked the campaign of Republican candidate Roy Moore. According to sources close to the matter, one of the women who accused Moore of soliciting dates from her when she was a teenager and he was in his 30’s is not only a passionate progressive, but she has actually worked for the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and is actively campaigning for Moore’s opponent, Doug Jones.
This stunning revelation raises serious questions about the motivations of the woman, who has been at the center of the sexual misconduct allegations against Moore. While Moore has denied any wrongdoing, this new information could potentially undermine the credibility of the accuser and the entire #MeToo movement.
The woman, who has chosen to remain anonymous, has been a vocal critic of Moore’s conservative views and has been actively campaigning for Jones. Her connection to the DNC is likely to raise eyebrows among conservatives, who have long accused the Democratic Party of engaging in dirty politics.
Moore’s campaign has issued a statement denouncing the woman’s actions, calling her a “fraud” and a “paid operative” for the DNC. “This is just the latest example of the Democratic Party’s desperation to win at any cost,” a spokesperson for Moore’s campaign said.
The development comes as the Alabama Senate race enters its final stretch, with the election just days away. The allegations against Moore have already had a significant impact on the race, with many Republicans distancing themselves from the candidate. If the allegations are proven to be true, it could be a major blow to Moore’s campaign and potentially hand the election to Jones.
In a statement, Jones’ campaign expressed gratitude for the woman’s actions, calling her a “hero” for standing up against Moore’s “unacceptable behavior.” “We are grateful for the bravery of this woman and for the many others who have come forward to expose Moore’s predatory behavior,” a spokesperson for Jones’ campaign said.
The revelation is the latest twist in a race that has been marked by controversy and drama. Moore has been accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women, including one who alleges he assaulted her when she was just 14 years old. Despite the allegations, Moore has refused to drop out of the race, and his supporters have rallied around him, insisting that the allegations are false and motivated by political opponents.
As the election approaches, it remains to be seen how this latest revelation will impact the race. But one thing is clear: the allegations against Moore have already had a significant impact on the campaign, and this latest twist could be the final nail in the coffin for the embattled candidate."

WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, Donald Trump was pronounced dead this morning after suffering a violent heart attack. The 70-year-old businessman and TV personality, who was previously treated for minor cardio vascular issues, was rushed to the hospital after his condition took a turn for the worse.
According to sources close to the Trump family, the businessman and politician was in good spirits earlier this morning, but suddenly collapsed at his Trump Tower office in New York City. Despite the best efforts of medical professionals, Trump was pronounced dead at the hospital just hours later.
The news of Trump's death has sent shockwaves throughout the political world, with many leaders and celebrities taking to social media to express their condolences. In a statement released earlier today, Trump's wife Melania described her husband as a ""fierce and loyal"" partner, and said that she and their children were ""devastated"" by his passing.
Trump, who was known for his controversial and polarizing political views, had been a prominent figure in American politics for decades. He first gained fame in the 1970s and 80s with his successful real estate and business ventures, and later became a reality TV star with his hit show ""The Apprentice.""
Despite his divisive reputation, Trump had a loyal following of supporters who praised his business acumen and straight-talking style. However, his campaign for the presidency has been marked by controversy and criticism, with many accusing him of making offensive and inflammatory remarks.
As news of Trump's death spreads, the political landscape is set to change dramatically. With Trump out of the race, the Republican Party is left scrambling to find a new candidate to challenge Hillary Clinton in the upcoming presidential election.
In a statement released earlier today, Clinton expressed her condolences to the Trump family, and said that she was ""saddened"" by the news of Trump's death.
The cause of Trump's death is still unknown, but sources close to the family say that he had been experiencing chest pains and shortness of breath in the days leading up to his collapse.

In a controversial move during his 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump proposed a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States. This proposal came at a time when Europe was grappling with unprecedented levels of migrations and terrorism, raising concerns among experts and lawmakers that the ban could exacerbate the problem.
According to a report by the Pew Research Center, the number of Muslim refugees entering Europe in 2015 alone exceeded 1.3 million, with many more attempting to make the perilous journey across the Mediterranean. This influx of migrants, combined with the ongoing threat of terrorism from extremist groups like ISIS, raised fears that Trump's ban could create a breeding ground for radicalization and violence.
""This proposal is not only morally reprehensible, but it also flies in the face of common sense and expert advice,"" said Sarah Williams, a counter-terrorism specialist at the Brookings Institution. ""The last thing we need is to turn away those who are fleeing persecution and violence, only to find themselves in a situation where they are more vulnerable to radicalization and exploitation by terrorist groups.""
Trump's proposal was met with widespread criticism from both sides of the political aisle, with many lawmakers and experts arguing that it would not only be unconstitutional but also ineffective in addressing the root causes of terrorism.
""This is not a solution to the problem of terrorism, but rather a distraction and a political stunt,"" said Senator John McCain (R-AZ). ""We need to address the underlying issues that lead to radicalization, such as poverty, inequality, and political instability, rather than resorting to blanket bans and discrimination.""
Despite the backlash, Trump has remained steadfast in his support for the ban, arguing that it is necessary to protect American national security. However, many experts warn that such a policy could have far-reaching and devastating consequences, both for the United States and for the global fight against terrorism."

Saturday, February 3, 2018 - New York - In an effort to protect the health and well-being of children, the New York State Department of Health has announced a new regulation that prohibits smoking in vehicles when children are present. The rule, which goes into effect immediately, is part of a broader effort to reduce the exposure of children to secondhand smoke and tobacco use.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), exposure to secondhand smoke can cause a range of health problems, including respiratory issues, ear infections, and even Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). The CDC also notes that children are particularly vulnerable to the effects of secondhand smoke because their lungs are still developing and they breathe more air per pound of body weight than adults.
The new regulation in New York State applies to all vehicles, including cars, buses, and vans, and makes it illegal for anyone to smoke in a vehicle when a child is present. The rule also prohibits smoking in vehicles if there is not enough air circulation to prevent the accumulation of secondhand smoke.
""Protecting the health and well-being of children is a top priority for the New York State Department of Health,"" said Dr. Howard Zucker, Acting Commissioner of Health. ""By prohibiting smoking in vehicles when children are present, we can significantly reduce their exposure to secondhand smoke and help to create a healthier environment for all New Yorkers.""
The new regulation comes as part of a broader effort by the state to reduce the prevalence of smoking and tobacco use, particularly among young people. According to the New York State Department of Health, smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the state, accounting for more than 10,000 deaths each year.
The regulation will be enforced by the New York State Police and other law enforcement agencies, who can issue fines of up to $100 for violations.
""We are committed to protecting the health and well-being of all New Yorkers, especially our children,"" said Governor Andrew M. Cuomo. ""This new regulation is just one of the many steps we are taking to reduce smoking and tobacco use, and to create a healthier and safer environment for everyone."""

Upon clearing the first-floor of the home, the responding officers realized that the blaring music was coming from the home’s basement.According to the officers, a bizarre crime scene was quickly uncovered upon entering the basement. Three men, which have since been identified as 62-year-old William Provost, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore were sitting in a circle on the basement’s concrete floor and ritualistically chanting while eating what police initially believed was an animal carcass, but was later identified as human remains.William Provost, who police believe to be the group’s ringleader, admitted to practicing cannibalism and told arresting officers:“I find human flesh to be the only thing that cures my type-2 diabetes and chronic depression. If expensive pharmaceutical drugs helped, I would figure out a way to obtain them, but they don’t, so I stick to what works for me”.Upon searching the home’s basement, police made several startling discoveries including a large room that appears to contain nothing more than decades worth of clutter, but upon further inspection, police discovered human remains hidden throughout the old wooden furniture and broken appliances.Police also discovered a kitchen style refrigerator located in a small room in the corner of the basement that contained the limbs, organs, and miscellaneous remains of what police believe to be upwards of 7-8 different individuals.In addition to the refrigerator, the small room in the basement also housed a make-shift ‘tool wall’ that contained a myriad of tools that police believe were used to dismember several victims.Upon their initial investigation, police believe the 3-men have been practicing cannibalism for the past 3-4 years and largely remained under the radar due to their practice of targeting and befriending homeless drifters they met at small dive-bars located upwards of 100-miles from their Vernal Heights residence.Vernal Heights Chief of Police, Gregory Moore, spoke to reporters during a brief press-conference this morning.“Though modern-day cannibalism is extremely rare, it does unfortunately exist. That said -treating diabetes and or depression has to be the most bizarre reason for practicing cannibalism that I’ve ever heard.”Provost’s accomplices, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore, also admitted to cannibalizing human flesh because they believed it would cure depression and told arresting officer’s that Provost took them under his wing in late-2012.As of Tuesday afternoon, police and detectives are still conducting a search at the residence located at 3845 Toolson Lane.All three men are current","Title: ""Florida Cannibals Arrested for Claiming Unconventional 'Cure' for Diabetes and Depression""
Florida - In a bizarre turn of events, Vernal Heights Police Department arrested three individuals for practicing cannibalism, claiming that consuming human flesh cures both type-1 and type-2 diabetes and depression. The arrests come after a series of disturbing incidents where the suspects allegedly preyed on vulnerable individuals, including the elderly and children, to satisfy their unconventional 'cure.'
According to police reports, the three suspects, identified as John Doe (35), Jane Smith (42), and Bob Johnson (58), had been operating an unlicensed 'healing center' in the city's outskirts, where they would lure unsuspecting victims with promises of a miraculous cure. The suspects allegedly used various tactics to convince their victims, including spreading false rumors about the effectiveness of their 'treatment' through social media and word of mouth.
""We take any claim of a miracle cure, especially one that involves harming others, very seriously,"" said Chief of Police, James Johnson. ""We will not stand idly by while individuals take advantage of vulnerable members of our community. We urge anyone with information about these incidents to come forward and help us put an end to this dangerous practice.""
The investigation is ongoing, and police have warned the public to be vigilant and skeptical of any unsolicited offers of 'healing' or 'cures' from unlicensed individuals or organizations. The suspects are currently being held at the Vernal Heights County Jail without bail and face multiple charges, including assault, kidnapping, and practicing medicine without a license.
In related news, health experts have condemned the suspects' claims, stating that there is no scientific evidence to support the idea that consuming human flesh can cure any medical condition, let alone diabetes and depression. ""We urge the public to consult reputable medical professionals for any health concerns they may have,"" said Dr. Maria Rodriguez, a leading endocrinologist.

Re: News Report: Mysterious Claim of a Secret Government Program
Monday, December 4, 2017 - In a shocking turn of events, a member of an online forum has raised concerns about a purported secret government program that has allegedly been operational for decades. The claim was made by Ken0069 in a post on Monday morning, which has since sparked a heated debate among forum users.
According to Ken0069, the program, known as ""Project X,"" has been hiding in plain sight for years, with no mainstream media outlet reporting on its existence. The program is said to be involved in a wide range of activities, including the manipulation of financial markets, the monitoring of citizens' personal data, and even the development of advanced technologies for military use.
While some forum users have expressed skepticism about the claim, others have expressed concern about the potential implications of such a program existing in secret. ""This is huge, if true,"" wrote one user. ""It means that our government has been operating outside of the law for decades, and we have no idea what they're capable of.""
Despite the heated debate, it remains unclear whether Project X actually exists. Ken0069 has provided no concrete evidence to support his claims, and mainstream media outlets have yet to report on the alleged program. However, the mystery surrounding Project X has only fueled the public's curiosity, with many calling for further investigation into the matter.

The Republican presidential frontrunner's proposal has been met with widespread criticism from politicians, civil rights groups, and religious leaders, who argue that such a ban would be both unconstitutional and discriminatory.

Obama decided your fallen didn’t deserve to be honored. That changes today. Americans will remember those that keep our streets safe big time.”Obama’s spokesman said the day of remembrance was scrapped so the Black Lives Matter movement wouldn’t be offended.

Washington D.C. - In a shocking move this morning, President Trump announced that he would be reinstating a national day of remembrance for fallen police officers, a move that has left many in the law enforcement community stunned and grateful.
Speaking in front of more than 10,000 police veterans at the annual National Police Week ceremony, President Trump made it clear that he would not tolerate the ""traitorous"" actions of his predecessor, former President Barack Obama, who had previously done away with the national day of remembrance.
""We will never forget the sacrifices made by our brave law enforcement officers who have given their lives in the line of duty,"" President Trump declared, his voice filled with emotion. ""And we will never forget the betrayal of trust that was perpetrated upon them by a president who did not have their backs.""
The crowd of veterans erupted into cheers and applause as President Trump went on to detail his plans to reinstate the national day of remembrance, which he claimed would be held on the second Sunday in May of each year.
""This day will be a time for us to honor the memory of those who have given their lives for their communities and their country,"" President Trump said. ""And it will be a time for us to reaffirm our commitment to the safety and well-being of our law enforcement officers, who are the very backbone of our society.""
The move by President Trump has been hailed as a major victory for the law enforcement community, and has been seen as a clear repudiation of the policies of the previous administration.
""This is a great day for America,"" said John Doe, a retired police officer from New York. ""President Trump has shown that he is a true friend of law enforcement, and we are grateful for his leadership.""
The reinstatement of the national day of remembrance is just the latest in a series of moves by President Trump to show his support for the law enforcement community. In recent months, he has also proposed significant increases in funding for police departments across the country, and has taken a tough stance on crime, particularly in regards to drug trafficking and gang violence.
As President Trump continues to make good on his campaign promises, it is clear that he is determined to keep his word and to make America safe again. And for the men and women of law enforcement, he is their strongest ally in this fight."

We want to make an important clarification on claims that were made by Rod Wheeler, the private investigator hired by Seth Rich's family, whose services are being paid for by a third party.What he told FOX 5 DC on camera Monday regarding Seth Rich's murder investigation is in clear contrast to what he has said over the last 48 hours. Rod Wheeler has since backtracked.In an interview Monday, Wheeler told FOX 5 DC he had sources at the FBI confirming there was evidence of communication between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks. This is the verbatim of that exchange:FOX 5 DC: “You have sources at the FBI saying that there is information...”WHEELER: ""For sure...""FOX 5 DC: “...that could link Seth Rich to WikiLeaks?""WHEELER: ""Absolutely. Yeah. That's confirmed.""In the past 48 hours, Rod Wheeler has told other media outlets he did not get his information from FBI sources, contradicting what he told us on Monday.Since Rod Wheeler backtracked Tuesday, FOX 5 DC attempted incessantly to communicate with him, but he didn't return calls or emails.On Wednesday, just before our newscast, Wheeler responded to our requests via a telephone conversation, where he now backtracks his position and Wheeler characterizes his on-the-record and on-camera statements as ""miscommunication.""When asked if Wheeler is still working for Seth Rich's family, Wheeler told FOX 5 DC the contract still stands-- ties have not been severed.We reached out once again to the Rich family, and through a spokesperson the Rich family tells FOX 5 DC, ""The family has relayed their deep disappointment with Rod Wheeler's conduct over the last 48 hours, and is exploring legal avenues to the family.""-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Original story:It has been almost a year since Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich was murdered in the nation's capital. There have been no solid answers about why he was killed until now.Rich was shot and killed last July in Northwest D.C and police have suggested the killing in the District's Bloomingdale neighborhood was a botched robbery. However, online conspiracy theories have tied the murder to Rich's work at the DNC.Just two months shy of the one-year anniversary of Rich's death, FOX 5 has learned there is new information that could prove these theorists right.Rod Wheeler, a private investigator hired by the Rich family, suggests there is tangible evidence on Rich's laptop that confirms he was communicating with WikiLeaks prior to his death. Wheeler's services were offered to the family and paid for by a third party, according to a statement issued by the Rich family Tuesday which also includes that ""the private investigator who spoke to press was offered to the Rich family and paid for by a third party, and contractually was barred from speaking to press or anyone outside of law enforcement or the family unless explicitly authorized by the family.""Now, questions have been raised on why D.C. police, the lead agency on this murder investigation for the past ten months, have insisted this was a robbery gone bad when there appears to be no evidence to suggest that.Wheeler, a former D.C. police homicide detective, is running a parallel investigation into Rich’s murder. He said he believes there is a cover-up and the police department has been told to back down from the investigation.""The police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming,” said Wheeler. “They haven't been cooperating at all. I believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer, which I believe is either at the police department or either at the FBI. I have been told both.”When we asked Wheeler if his sources have told him there is information that links Rich to Wikileaks, he said, “Absolutely. Yeah. That's confirmed.""Wheeler also told us, ""I have a source inside the police departm","On Tuesday, a federal judge ordered the US Department of Justice to release more documents related to the death of Seth Rich. Rich, a former DNC staff member, was shot and killed in July 2016. A conspiracy theory emerged online that Rich was involved in the DNC email leak and was murdered to cover it up. The DOJ initially denied a FOIA request from a private investigator, but the judge ruled that the agency must now release any documents that are not exempt from disclosure. We will continue to follow this story and provide updates as more information becomes available."

politifact14148,1,0,"We all get lazy from time to time and just want to quit everything, crawl back to bed under a layer of blankets and live there until we feel better. We might feel a bit guilty but a relaxing day in bed sounds awesome. Even though it’s a luxury which few of us can afford, at least we can all fantasize about it.If you’re one of those who are in desperate need of some peace and relaxation, NASA might offer you the perfect opportunity to do so and get payed on top of it. But it may involve a bit more relaxation than you’re prepared for.NASA has put out an ad looking for people who’re willing to take part in their “Rest Studies” – a study which will require participant to spend 70 straight days in bed, relaxing and smoking different types of cannabis, for which they will receive a salary of 18.000 USD. During the relaxation period participants are allowed to read books, play games, Skype and smoke weed. They can do whatever they want as long as it involves staying in bed, week after week, earning a cool 1200 USD per week.So what is the exact purpose of these studies?These studies have the purpose of figuring out the best way to preserve astronauts’ health and safety during periods of prolonged space travel. Complete rest and relaxation is the best way to stimulate zero gravity in space because zero gravity actually means zero weight or strain on your muscle. Additionally, they wanted to see how marijuana will affect the body in such an environment.The Rest Study is a very convenient way to examine the changes our body endures during space travel.This study is designed to achieve three core tasks:Examining how the astronauts’ changing physiology in space could affect the process of certain missions.Examining if the astronauts’ physiological state could affect their ability to perform in particular tasks.Preparing countermeasures to combat any impairment that these physiological conditions may impose.The study’s participants were divided into two groups: exercising and non-exercising.The exercising group will have to exercise (on a specially designed equipment to maintain the laying down position and smoke cannabis), while the non-exercising group will just have to lie down and relax completely.The entire study will last somewhere between 97 and 105, depending on whether you’re in the exercising or non-exercising group.Once the study begins, during the initial 13 days (non-exercising subjects) and 21 days (exercising subjects) you can move around the bed rest area freely, in and out of bed. But once this period ends, for the next 70 days you’ll be forbidden from leaving your bed. For 70 days you’ll have to lie down, with your feet up, kick back and enjoy! You’ll get out of bed only for a few tests and nothing more. 70 days of complete lazing.During the study, NASA will have to conduct bone, muscle and heart tests, as well as tests of your circulatory and nervous systems, your nutritional condition, and your body’s immunity system.But is it worth it?You may not think so at first, but spending two whole months in bed can be really excruciating. At some point you may feel like you can’t take it anymore but at least you can rest assured that your efforts will help in the advancement of human space travel.This will probably be your only opportunity to say that you’ve actually helped send the first astronauts to Mars by just being your lazy self and doing nothing in particular but lying flat on your back.Source:http://mysteriousearth.net","---
Title: Feeling the Weight of the World: Quarter of Population Struggles with 'Laziness'

In a stunning revelation, a new study has found that an alarming quarter of the global population is struggling with an overwhelming sense of laziness, with many feeling the urge to quit their daily responsibilities and retreat to a cozy bedroom hideout.
The study, conducted by a team of researchers from the University of Melbourne, surveyed over 10,000 individuals across 10 different countries and found that a significant portion of the population is plagued by this seemingly insurmountable feeling of inertia.
""Laziness is not just a minor inconvenience, it's a pervasive and persistent problem that affects people of all ages and backgrounds,"" said Dr. Sarah Johnson, lead author of the study. ""Our findings suggest that this issue is far more widespread than we initially thought, and it's impacting people's ability to function in their daily lives.""
The study identified several factors that contribute to this phenomenon, including stress, anxiety, and depression. ""In today's fast-paced world, it's easy to feel overwhelmed and burnt out,"" Dr. Johnson explained. ""When we're constantly bombarded with stimuli and responsibilities, it's no wonder that some people feel like they just want to give up and hide under the covers.""
While the study's findings may come as a surprise to some, they highlight the importance of addressing this issue and providing support to those affected. ""We need to start talking openly and honestly about laziness and its impact on our lives,"" said Dr. Johnson. ""By acknowledging and addressing this problem, we can work towards finding solutions that promote mental health and wellbeing.""
In the meantime, those struggling with laziness are encouraged to practice self-care and prioritize their mental health. ""Taking a break, engaging in relaxing activities, and seeking support from loved ones can go a long way in managing this issue,"" said Dr. Johnson. ""Remember, you're not alone in this, and with the right support, you can overcome the weight of the world and find your inner strength once again."""

Washington D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the West Texas Federal Appeals Court has ordered former President Barack Obama to repay $400 million to the American people for funds he allegedly ""lost"" during an illegal transaction with Iranian hard-liners. According to court documents, Obama, who served as President from 2009 to 2017, approved a secret deal with Iran in 2016 that allowed the country to access $400 million in frozen assets in exchange for the release of four American prisoners. However, the court found that the transaction was conducted without proper authorization and violated federal law.
""This is a clear case of corruption and abuse of power,"" said Judge John Smith, who presided over the case. ""The former President has a legal and moral obligation to repay the funds to the American people.""
Obama's representatives have yet to comment on the ruling, but legal experts say the former President could face criminal charges for his involvement in the transaction.
The news has sent shockwaves through Washington D.C. and beyond, with many calling for greater transparency and accountability in government. ""This is a wake-up call for all of us,"" said Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). ""We need to make sure that our leaders are held accountable for their actions and that the public's trust is restored.""
The ruling is just the latest in a series of controversies to plague the Obama administration, including the ongoing investigation into the Trump-Russia collusion scandal.

Mr. Gonzalez was observed around 3:00 p.m. PDT wearing a jacket and walking “out of the creek area and a plume of smoke behind him,” according to the Santa Rosa Press Democrat.Mr. Gonzalez, who is homeless and reportedly known by law enforcement to have been living under a nearby bridge, claimed he was cold and had lit the fire to stay warm. But it was a balmy 78 degrees when he and the plume of smoke were first observed.Mr. Gonzalez was booked into the Sonoma County Jail for suspicion of felony arson. His bail was set at a steep $110,000, according to the Sonoma County Sheriff Public Information Officer.Sargent Spencer Crum told Breitbart that Mr. Gonzalez is also on a U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) detainer request, despite Sonoma County declaring itself as a “sanctuary county” in May 2014. The county only cooperates with “ICE holds” if the prisoner has been convicted of a felony or any misdemeanor offence that falls within the Trust Act within the last five years. Mr. Gonzalez’s immigration status has not yet been announced.The American Civil Liberties Union argues detainers are a violation of “unreasonable searches and seizures” under the U.S. Constitution’s Fourth Amendment.The Sonoma County Sheriff Department’s “1.0 Policy Statement” reads: “No person shall be held solely on the basis of their immigration status.” The policy adds that “the immigration status of a person, and the lack of immigration documentation, should have no bearing on the manner in which Sheriff’s Office personnel execute their duties.”According to ICE documents, Sonoma County declined 491 detainer requests in 2014 and 2015. During the 2017 period from January 28 through February 3, when President Donald Trump issued his immigration Executive Order 13768 to require all federal, state and local government to comply with ICE detainers, Sonoma County still denied detainers.Sonoma County fires have killed dozens. 172 are still missing and 102,000 residents have been dislocated — about one-fifth of the entire population. The latest financial losses include 3,819 unincorporated parcels with 100 structures valued at $2,016,962,239, and 2,907 homes and 86 commercial units lost in the city of Santa Rosa valued at $1.18 billion.","Title: Update on California Wildfires: Jesus Fabian Gonzales Not Suspected in Recent Fires

The day of the wedding, thousands of Britons took the day off, and about 1,900 guests attended the ceremony in Westminster Abbey in central London.

The risk of embarrassment, were such a protest to occur at a royal wedding, might put the couple off inviting such a controversial figure.Instead of a state visit, Trump’s trip to the U.K., scheduled for early 2018, has been cast as a “working trip” where he will not meet the queen.

According to sources close to the family, the elector, who has not been named, had been struggling with feelings of despair and hopelessness since the election results were announced last Tuesday.
The elector, who was in his mid-50s, had been a lifelong Democrat and had strongly opposed Trump's candidacy throughout the election campaign. Despite his best efforts, Trump won the state of Michigan by a narrow margin, leading the elector to feel defeated and disillusioned with the political process.
In a heart-wrenching suicide note, the elector expressed his deep disappointment and frustration with the outcome of the election, writing that he could no longer bear the thought of living in a country led by a president he saw as unfit and unqualified.
""I never thought I would see the day when America would elect such a dangerous and unstable leader,"" the elector wrote. ""I can only hope that my death will serve as a wake-up call to my fellow citizens, and that they will work towards a better future for our country.""
The news of the elector's suicide has sent shockwaves through the political community, with many fellow electors and politicians expressing their deepest condolences to the elector's family.
""This is a tragedy of the utmost proportions,"" said one fellow elector. ""We must all take a close look at ourselves and our actions, and work towards creating a more inclusive and compassionate society. No one should ever feel that they have to take their own life in order to make a point.""
The incident has also raised questions about the mental health support available to electors and other political figures, and the need for greater awareness and resources to address the growing issue of suicide among political leaders.
In a statement, the Trump transition team expressed their deepest sympathies to the elector's family, and urged anyone struggling with mental health issues to seek help immediately.
""We are deeply saddened by the loss of this dedicated public servant,"" the statement read. ""We urge anyone struggling with mental health issues to reach out for help, and to know that there are many resources available to support them.""
The incident has sparked a renewed debate about the mental health of political leaders, and the need for greater awareness and support for those in positions of power. As the nation mourns the loss of this dedicated elector, it is clear that more must be done to address this critical issue."
politifact14908,1,1,"Delta Force Raids Obama Stronghold in Thailand[Note: Please view our newest article on Trump’s attack against Deep State assets: FBI RAIDS HOME OF HILLARY CLINTON COLLABORATORDuring the pre-dawn hours on Christmas Day, Delta Force operators launched a precision strike against an Obama-controlled stronghold in Thailand, says an active Secret Service agent who claims President Trump green lit the operation following a series of telephone calls to United States military commanders and to Thailand Prime Minister Nik Bukharin.A Delta detachment, known as 1-SFOD in the Special Operations community, flew from Okinawa, Japan to the United States Embassy in Bangkok, and held position while Trump cleared the incursion with his Thai counterparts.According to our source, the Trump administration learned that Obama, by proxy, owned a mansion and a 400-acre estate on the outskirts of the city of Si Sa Ket, approximately 500 km from Bangkok. On paper, the land was owned by the allegedly defunct Solyndra Corporation, a startup solar company to which Obama gave 2.2 billion taxpayer dollars in 2009. Shortly thereafter, Solyndra declared bankruptcy, and the money vanished. Despite apparent poverty, Solyndra maintained real estate holdings valued at over 800 million dollars in a half-dozen Southeast Asian countries. The Trump administration connected the dots, linking Obama to the Thai property, after asserting Presidential privilege and subpoenaing flight records that demonstrably proved Obama had travelled to Si Sa Ket six times as president and an additional four times in the past year.In a June 2009 edition of the Washington Beacon, conservative author Thomas Clearwater wrote, “Solyndra does not appear to be a legitimate institution, and is likely a shell company or slush fund used or owned by Obama to launder his dirty money.”Our Secret Service source supports that contention.“Obama holds real estate, vast sums of currency, and shadow companies across the globe, under many aliases. He doesn’t keep them in his name, as that would be too conspicuous. The administration has learned about many of them and has been working with foreign governments to seize Obama’s illicitly gained assets. Many of these nations are not exactly friendly to the United States; we don’t know what Trump offered in exchange for rights to seize assets in non-extradition countries or put special operations boots on the ground on foreign soil. I’m sure the price way high. Clandestine missions are occurring right now. The Solyndra mansion was just one of many,” our source explained.At 3:00 am (local time), a pair of helicopters, including decoy craft, airlifted Delta to its destination. They found the mansion deserted; however, according to our source, the dwelling had been recently occupied. The unit commander discovered freshly chopped vegetables and lukewarm coffee in the kitchen; outside fresh tire impressions lead away from the compound. Someone, our source said, must have tipped off the occupants shortly before Delta arrived on scene.Still, Delta did not leave the location empty-handed. They seized several encrypted laptops and over 200 million dollars in gold bullion, in addition to dozens of crates containing Chinese manufactured firearms and explosives. Moreover, and perhaps most disturbing, a maze of underground tunnels, ostensibly used for human trafficking, ran for miles in every direction beneath the surface. Having gathered all available evidence, they requested exfiltration and handed-off control to Thai law enforcement.Under power granted by the ASEAN Declaration to Joint Action on Counter Terrorism, Thai officials confiscated the estate and all remaining possessions contained therein.(Visited 18,013 times, 4 visits today)","According to the agent, the raid was conducted in response to what the Trump administration deems a credible threat to U.S. national security posed by the Obama faction, which has been waging a guerrilla war against the legitimate government of the United States since Trump's election in 2016.So far, there has been no official confirmation from the White House or the U.S. military of the operation, but sources on the ground in Thailand have confirmed that a raid of a compound in the Chiang Mai region took place around 2:30 a.m. local time.The compound, which is believed to be the headquarters of an Obama-linked organization known as the ""Global Resistance Movement,"" was said to be heavily fortified with layers of security, including armored vehicles and heavily armed guards.Despite these defenses, the Delta Force operators were able to breach the compound and neutralize the threat within minutes, according to the agent. No U.S. personnel were reportedly killed or injured in the operation, but the source would not comment on the status of any Obama operatives.""President Trump has made it clear that he will not tolerate any further threats to U.S. national security from the Deep State, including those who worked under his predecessor,"" the agent said in a statement. ""This operation is just the beginning of a larger campaign to cleanse the U.S. government of all corrupt and rogue elements.""The raid on the Obama stronghold in Thailand comes on the heels of a series of high-profile attacks on Trump administration officials, including a recent assassination attempt on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Kabul, Afghanistan.While the full extent of the Obama faction's operations and motivations remain unclear, the Trump administration has made it clear that it will stop at nothing to protect the United States and its interests from those who seek to undermine it."

For too long, the voices of young people have been ignored or dismissed in the halls of power. But on Saturday, the world watched as a new generation of leaders emerged, armed with nothing but their convictions and a fierce determination to change the status quo.
From Emma Gonzalez, who delivered a powerful and unflinching speech that has gone viral around the world, to David Hogg, who has become the face of the movement, these teenagers have shown a level of courage and conviction that is rare in any age group.
As the dust settles on Saturday's rally, it is clear that the March for Our Lives has given birth to a new generation of leaders who will not be silenced by the doubters and naysayers. These young people are not afraid to take on the powerful interests that have long held sway over our political system, and they will stop at nothing to make their voices heard.
In a time of great uncertainty and division, the March for Our Lives has given us a glimmer of hope. And as we look to the future, it is clear that the next generation of leaders will be the ones to shape our world for the better."

Title: Shark Spotted on Puerto Rico Street Sends Islanders into Panic
SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico - In a bizarre turn of events, a picture of a shark swimming on a street in Puerto Rico has gone viral, leaving islanders in a state of panic. The image, which appears to show a large shark gliding through the streets of a coastal town, has been shared thousands of times on social media platforms, with many users expressing disbelief and fear.
According to eyewitnesses, the shark was spotted swimming in the direction of a popular beach resort, prompting authorities to issue a warning to beachgoers to stay clear of the water until further notice.
""We are taking this situation very seriously,"" said Governor of Puerto Rico, Ricardo Rossello. ""We have deployed marine biologists to the area to assess the situation and ensure the safety of our citizens.""
The image, which was originally shared on Reddit, appears to be a genuine photograph, but experts have pointed out that it is unlikely that a shark would be able to survive in freshwater.
""It's possible that the shark may have been swept into the ocean through a storm drain or other waterway,"" said Dr. Maria Rodriguez, a marine biologist at the University of Puerto Rico. ""But it's also possible that this is a hoax, and we are not ruling that out at this time.""
Regardless of the cause, the sighting has sent shockwaves through the island community, with many residents calling for increased safety measures to prevent similar incidents in the future.
""I was walking to work this morning when I saw the shark,"" said Maria Rodriguez, a resident of San Juan. ""I couldn't believe my eyes. I'm still shaking with fear.""
As authorities continue to investigate the matter, islanders are being advised to remain cautious and stay away from the water until further notice. The sighting has also raised questions about the potential dangers of marine life in the area, and whether more needs to be done to protect the island's coastline."

Head of Catholic Church says those who own weapons are ‘hypocrites,’ not Christians
In a bold move, Pope Francis has denounced gun owners as hypocrites, saying that those who possess weapons cannot call themselves Christians. This statement comes as pressure mounts to tear up the US Constitution once and for all, with many Americans demanding stricter gun control measures.
Speaking during his weekly address, the Pope stated, “It is a sin to own a weapon. It is a sin to promote violence. It is a sin to stand idly by while others are harmed.” He continued, “Those who claim to be followers of Christ but own weapons are hypocrites. They are not true Christians. They are not living according to the teachings of our Lord and Savior.”
The Pope’s comments have sparked widespread debate and outrage, with many gun owners vowing to stand by their right to bear arms. However, the Pope remains resolute, insisting that the protection of human life and dignity must take precedence over the Second Amendment.
As the US government grapples with the issue of gun control, the Pope’s words have added weight to the calls for stricter measures. Many Americans are now demanding that their elected representatives take action to protect the nation’s citizens from the scourge of gun violence.
In the wake of this latest development, it remains to be seen how the US government will respond to the Pope’s call to action.

SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, TEXAS - In a shocking and tragic turn of events, the gunman responsible for the mass shooting inside the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs has been identified as Devin Kelley, a self-proclaimed member of the far-left extremist group Antifa. According to law enforcement officials, Kelley, 26, was motivated by a twisted ideology of promoting anarchy and violence in the United States, specifically targeting white conservative churches.
The disturbing details of Kelley's manifesto, obtained by investigators, reveal a calculating and deliberate act of terrorism aimed at sparking a civil war in the country. In the manifesto, Kelley vowed to unleash chaos and destruction upon the United States, stating, ""I will start a civil war by targeting white conservative churches and causing anarchy in the country.""
The shooting, which occurred on Sunday morning, resulted in the deaths of at least 26 people and injured several others. The victims included men, women, and children, who were gathered inside the church to worship and attend a religious service.
As the investigation into the shooting continues, law enforcement officials are working to determine the motive behind Kelley's actions and to identify any potential accomplices. In a press conference held earlier today, FBI Special Agent in Charge, James Smith, stated, ""We are treating this as a domestic terrorism incident, and we will leave no stone unturned in our investigation to uncover the full extent of Kelley's twisted ideology and any individuals or groups who may have supported him.""
The shooting at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs has sent shockwaves of horror and grief throughout the community, with residents and faith leaders expressing their deepest condolences to the families of the victims. In a statement released earlier today, Texas Governor Greg Abbott said, ""The Lone Star State mourns the loss of life in this senseless act of violence, and we stand united in our resolve to protect the safety and security of all Texans.""
As the nation grapples with this latest act of gun violence, attention has turned to the growing phenomenon of far-right extremism and the role it plays in perpetuating acts of terrorism. Experts warn that the rise of extremist groups like Antifa, fueled by a toxic mix of political ideology and social media, poses a growing threat to public safety and national security.
In the aftermath of the Sutherland Springs shooting, many are calling for greater action to be taken to address the root causes of extremism and to prevent future acts of violence. As the investigation into Kelley's motives continues, one thing is clear: the United States must stand united in its commitment to protecting the safety and security of all its citizens, regardless of their political beliefs or affiliations."

In a shocking turn of events, a flight attendant on a United Airlines flight from New York City to Chicago has been charged with assault after a violent incident involving a 7 month-old baby boy. According to eyewitnesses, the flight attendant, identified as 35-year-old Maria Rodriguez, allegedly assaulted the baby boy during the flight, causing him to cry uncontrollably.
The incident occurred around 30 minutes into the flight, when Rodriguez was distributing snacks and drinks to passengers. Witnesses claim that Rodriguez was particularly rough with the baby boy, who was seated in a bassinet near the front of the plane.
""She was yelling at him and shaking him,"" said one passenger, who wished to remain anonymous. ""It was terrifying to watch. The baby was just crying and crying.""
Rodriguez was immediately met with backlash from fellow passengers, who were outraged by her behavior. According to reports, she was restrained by fellow crew members and taken off the plane at the next stop.
United Airlines has released a statement condemning the incident and promising to take appropriate action. ""The safety and well-being of our passengers is our top priority,"" the statement read. ""We will not tolerate any form of abuse or violence towards our passengers, and we will take swift action against any crew members who engage in such behavior.""
Rodriguez has been charged with assault and is currently being held at a nearby police station. She has yet to comment on the incident.
The incident has sparked outrage among parents and passengers alike, with many calling for greater accountability and better training for flight attendants. ""This is unacceptable behavior, and it's not the first time we've seen something like this,"" said one passenger. ""Flight attendants need to be trained to handle situations like this, and they need to be held accountable when they fail to do so.""

politifact13687,1,0,"The Republican war on women continues unabated. The same week that conservatives argued in the Supreme Court that employers should be able to stop their employees from getting contraception outside of the company health plan, Indiana joined the ranks of states like Texas and Florida in passing a draconian law that purports to protect women, while in fact, endangering their health by making safe abortion much harder to get. And Gov. Mike Pence recently signed it. The bill is stuffed with as many asinine restrictions on abortion with an eye towards making abortion as miserable and humiliating an experience as possible, and ideally something women can’t get legally at all.Asked to comment on his approval of a piece of legislation that basically promotes hatred towards women once stripped of all the legal terms, Pence argued in an interview with The Huffington Post that “abortion as such was a mistake since the day it was first invented.” “So, let’s get that straight right away – I oppose abortion for any reason whatsoever because I believe that killing someone, or something, if you will, that hasn’t developed a consciousness just yet is the ultimate act of crime. And if we’re murderers of innocent beings who can’t defend themselves, how are we to expect people with a fully developed consciousness to stop murdering each other?” the Indiana governor said.“And as if that wasn’t enough,” Pence continued, “we’ve got this situation now throughout different states where some lawmakers allow abortion under some circumstances like rape or when the fetus is diagnosed with an illness, and others just flat out prohibit it. And that’s bad for a number of reasons. First and foremost – we can’t have this kind of freedom of choice. This is bad, let’s be clear. And that’s part of the reason why I signed this bill, because I believe abortion, or I’m going to flat out call it murder, this murdering of children has to stop and it has to be prohibited in every state. So Indiana is just a step in the right direction.”Pence also tried to offer his opinion on what would have happened had he allowed rape victims to still have abortion. “First and foremost, because this is such a sensitive topic, let me just say that I sympathize with rape victims not just in America, but around the world. I can only imagine what it must be like to experience such trauma,” he said. “However, that does not justify murder, not even that justifies murdering a baby, not in my book. Because what would happen? We’d then have an epidemic of women claiming to have been raped just so they could have an abortion. And that has to be stopped at all cost.”Donald Trump’s new running mate also said, “Basically, if I’d have said no on the bill, that would be just like giving out get-pregnant-without-fear cards, because at the end of the day, women could have unprotected sex without worrying about what they’d do in the event of pregnancy. And you know, it’s not supposed to be like that. That would be equal to me picking up a butcher’s knife and slicing people open in the middle of the street. That would be murder. And I’m not a murderer.”“And it gets worse – when you get an abortion, you get several days off of work and whatnot to recover. And there are a lot of crazy people out there. What if women would go out and get raped on purpose just so they could get off work? I mean, Indiana’s economy is struggling as it is, and having thousands of women absent from their jobs would be horrific for the state, I’m telling you. I made the right call and that will be confirmed in the long run,” Pence concluded.",What do you think?

With liberals, there is only resistance. Instead of inviting civil discourse, leftist ideologues are resorting to suppression, harassment, and even physical violence in response to “problematic” ideas. Of course, they’re quickly discovering that their juvenile and fascist actions have consequences.On Friday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and her extended family members, many of whom are liberals, were forced out of the Red Hen eatery in Lexington, Virginia, by co-owner Stephanie Wilkinson. Although the party politely obliged the indignant staffers, Wilkinson proceeded to gather her comrades and stalk Sanders’ family at another restaurant, screaming insults and demanding they leave. Now that word of her behavior is national news, Wilkinson is being forced to live by her own principles.Red Hen co-owner Stephanie Wilkinson has not only been forced to step down as executive director of Main Street Lexington, according to Fox News, she’s also placed herself in the center of what could turn into a massive lawsuit for damages concerning the effect her discrimination against Sarah Huckabee Sanders has had on Red Hen establishments across the country. Along with her resignation from the organization, Wilkinson’s bigotry has caused unaffiliated Red Hen restaurants across the U.S. to suffer protests, negative reviews, and boycotts, CBS News reports.Main Street Lexington president Elizabeth Outland Branner offered a short response in reference to Wilkinson’s resignation, which is undoubtedly a move toward damage control for the group, which represents many local businesses.“Considering the events of the past weekend, Stephanie felt it best that for the continued success of Main Street Lexington, she should step aside,” Branner wrote in an email.Wilkinson has caused such severe damage to other like-named establishments that business owners are desperately addressing the public outrage by disavowing the disgraced liberal feminist and declaring that it is illegal to refuse service to customers based on their political leanings.More than 4,300 replied, including multiple tweets calling on the restaurant to condone Sanders and the Trump administration’s actions. The Red Hen answered the threats by defining “unaffiliated” as well as an explanation that it is illegal for businesses in the District of Columbia to discriminate against people because of their political views.Another Red Hen restaurant, this one in Swedesboro, New Jersey, also faced a slew of angry calls and social media posts for refusing to serve a woman who’d never stepped through their door.“Kindly check your facts before you erroneously defame an innocent victim on Facebook,” said a post on the family-owned restaurant’s Facebook page.The manager of a New Jersey-based restaurant with the same name lamented that their location’s rating has plummetted from “4.8 stars to three-point-something.” An owner in Saybrook, Connecticut, attempted to prevent this same damage by adding a pop-up box stating that their restaurant has “absolutely no affiliation with any other Red Hen restaurant anywhere else.”Wilkinson has defended her discriminatory actions, ironically claiming that she doesn’t enjoy “confrontation” but feels a moral duty to harass political figures and their innocent family members.“I’m not a huge fan of confrontation,” Wilkinson told The Post. “I have a business, and I want the business to thrive.” But, she went on to say, “This feels like the moment in our democracy when people have to make uncomfortable actions and decisions to uphold their morals.”When the mainstream media propagates that those with certain political views are “Na","by Kalpana 3 hours ago
WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the owner of the Red Hen restaurant in Lexington, Virginia, Stephanie Wilkinson, has been kicked out of the White House press briefing room. This comes after Wilkinson had recently kicked out White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and her family from her restaurant last week.
According to sources close to the White House, President Donald Trump was outraged by Wilkinson's actions and decided to take matters into his own hands. During a press briefing today, Trump announced that Wilkinson would no longer be allowed to attend any White House press briefings or events.
""Stephanie Wilkinson has shown a clear pattern of intolerance and disrespect towards those with whom she disagrees,"" Trump said in a statement. ""Her actions are not only unacceptable, but they are also a threat to the fundamental principles of free speech and the exchange of ideas that are essential to a healthy democracy.""
Wilkinson has yet to comment on the situation, but many have come to her defense, calling Trump's decision an attack on the freedom of the press. ""This is a clear violation of Wilkinson's First Amendment rights,"" said a spokesperson for the American Civil Liberties Union. ""The President's actions are a dangerous precedent that could have far-reaching consequences for the entire media industry.""
Despite the backlash, Trump remains unapologetic, saying, ""I will not stand idly by while those who seek to silence others are allowed to operate with impunity.""
The situation has sparked a heated debate on social media, with many expressing their outrage at Trump's actions. ""This is a direct attack on the freedom of the press,"" tweeted CNN's Jake Tapper. ""The President's actions are a clear violation of the First Amendment.""
Others, however, have defended Trump's decision, saying that Wilkinson's actions were unacceptable and that she had no right to expect special treatment. ""If she can't abide by the rules of the White House, then she shouldn't be allowed in,"" said a former White House official.
The incident has once again raised questions about the role of the media in a democratic society and the limits of free speech. As the debate rages on, one thing is clear: the Red Hen owner's actions have sparked a firestorm of controversy that shows no signs of abating anytime soon."

Three years after Fox’s Megyn Kelly definitively explained to America that both Jesus Christ and Santa Claus were white men, Mall of America dismissed her advice and hired Larry Jefferson, a retired U.S. Army veteran from Irving, Texas to spend four days at the mall listening to the wish lists of children of all colors.Among many who were offended by this move was former half-term governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin. The sharp-tongued Republican wasted no time in condemning the company’s actions, going on social media and posting comments that called for boycotting and “running Mall of America into the ground,” on the basis of Santa “always having been white in the Bible.” “No, I refuse to believe that they went this far in trying to cater to the minorities, I thought the company had some backbone but I guess I was wrong,” Palin told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune.She also argued that hiring a non-white Santa Claus was “the last straw” in corporate America’s twisting of traditional, conservative Christian values, “because they realized they couldn’t make any more money off of the usual scams and techniques they’ve been using so far.” She added, “That’s why they had to come up with something new and out of the box, at least something that appeared that way in their minds. But, this proves that they have no morals and that they won’t shy away from even the most blatant twisting of traditional Christian values, just so they could make more money. I understand having to make a profit in order to get by and have a good life, but I don’t understand stomping on things that are holy and sacred in order to accomplish that.”“That’s why Americans, especially white ones, need to boycott the company and need to run it into the ground, so that they never ever come up with such an offensive and sacrilegious idea again,” Palin added. “The Holy Book always said Santa Claus was white and any kind of deviation from that, regardless of its magnitude, is a sin. And we need to make an example out of Mall of America. If we don’t, if we let them get away with it, what’s next? Others will follow their example and the next thing we know, we’re going to be having Arab Santa Clauses that are going to be teaching our kids how to make IEDs out of Christmas lights. I mean, just look at the number of white youngsters infatuated with rap and hip-hop music; you think that’s happening by accident?”“Nope, our children are systematically being indoctrinated into other cultures and interests that have nothing to do with traditional, white Christianity.

Title: Mainstream Media Under Fire for Ignoring Illegal Immigration Reality
Washington D.C. - In a bold statement, a senior media analyst has accused mainstream media outlets of turning a blind eye to the pressing issue of illegal immigration. Speaking to a gathering of journalists, the analyst argued that the media's reluctance to address the issue is not only irresponsible but also detrimental to the country's well-being.
""For the mainstream media to say that illegal immigration isn't an issue they really need to look at the world around them and see how things really are out there,"" said the analyst, who wished to remain anonymous. ""The numbers don't lie - illegal immigration is a growing concern that affects every aspect of our society, from our economy to our national security.""
According to recent data, the number of undocumented immigrants in the US has reached an all-time high, with over 11 million people entering the country illegally each year. This influx of migrants has put a significant strain on public resources, including healthcare, education, and law enforcement.
""The mainstream media has a responsibility to report on this issue with fairness and accuracy,"" the analyst continued. ""By ignoring the facts and dismissing the concerns of the American people, they are not only failing in their duty but also contributing to the problem.""
The analyst's comments come as the US government struggles to find a solution to the illegal immigration crisis. Despite the passage of several comprehensive immigration reform bills, the issue remains unresolved, with many critics arguing that the government's inaction has led to a surge in illegal immigration.
In response to the analyst's statement, a spokesperson for a leading mainstream media outlet issued a statement, saying, ""We take our responsibility to report on this issue very seriously. However, we also recognize that immigration is a complex and multifaceted issue that requires nuanced and thoughtful coverage. We will continue to provide accurate and balanced reporting on this important topic.""
Despite the media outlet's denial, many critics argue that the mainstream media's failure to address illegal immigration is a result of a broader trend towards political correctness and a reluctance to offend certain groups.
""The media's avoidance of this issue is not only unfortunate but also dangerous,"" said a former immigration official. ""By ignoring the facts, they are putting the security of the American people at risk. It's time for the mainstream media to take this issue seriously and do their job."""

We need a great match. Not another rigged result that doesn’t pass the sniff test.“I like money as much as the next guy. But I like football more. I can’t stand by and allow rampant greed and cynicism to destroy the game I love. The little boy in me won’t allow it.“Football in America won’t recover from this.”Early reports stating Goodes had been shot dead in an “gangland-style execution” in New York City have also been scrubbed from the internet, but not before alert readers captured screenshots of the story.According to Goodes, the NFL have organized a “rigged game” that will earn “maximum revenue” for the league, and hundreds of millions for broadcasters and advertisers, but will leave increasingly jaded Americans with a bad taste in their mouth.“This is the biggest scam in sports history,” Goodes said in Minneapolis, according to reports. “The Super Bowl is already completely scripted out.”“How do I know it’s scripted? I’ve read the damn thing.““You need to understand the NFL is a $35 billion shared revenue corporation. Outcomes can’t be left to chance. Total league revenues are shared equally by all franchises, so they don’t care who wins or loses. Let me be perfectly clear here. It doesn’t matter to the franchise owners. It doesn’t matter to the players. But it matters to the league. Outcomes have been fixed to maximize profits ever since my early days here.”“The sad thing is that it’s legal. Can you believe that?

Title: NFL Entertainment Lawyer Found Dead Hours After Alleging Super Bowl LII is 'Rigged'
In a shocking turn of events, an NFL entertainment lawyer, who has worked for the corporation for over 15 years, was found dead in New York City hours after making explosive allegations about the upcoming Super Bowl LII.
According to law enforcement officials, the lawyer, whose name has not been released, was discovered in his apartment by a friend who had gone to check on him after he failed to show up for work.
An investigation into the cause of death is currently underway, but officials say there are no signs of foul play.
The lawyer's death comes just hours after he told reporters that he had evidence that Super Bowl LII was ""rigged"" and that the outcome of the game had already been predetermined.
""He was adamant that he had proof and was going to expose it,"" a source close to the lawyer told CNN. ""He was terrified for his safety and the safety of his family.""
The lawyer's allegations had sent shockwaves through the NFL world, with many expressing disbelief and outrage at the claims.
""We are deeply saddened by the loss of our colleague and are fully cooperating with the authorities in their investigation,"" an NFL spokesperson said in a statement. ""We want to assure our fans that the integrity of the game is of the utmost importance to us and we will not tolerate any attempts to undermine that integrity.""
The lawyer's death has raised many questions about the legitimacy of the Super Bowl and the NFL's ability to ensure the integrity of the game.
As the investigation continues, one thing is clear: the NFL's reputation is at stake and they will stop at nothing to prove that the game is fair and square."

The only food-related duty Lisa has done for the past six months is retrieve Trump’s orders from drive-through windows and scoop the President’s ice cream from the carton.”Mr. Trump’s favorite fast food choices are reportedly Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonalds, and he eats his fried chicken, burgers, and fries with a knife and fork according to a White House staffer who requested anonymity to avoid consequences from leaking about the President’s eating habits to the press.“It’s borderline creepy,” the staffer said. “The first thing Trump does with his fried chicken is pick off all the skin from every piece like he’s dissecting the chickens with a scalpel or something, and then he puts it all in a pile. Then he cuts off all the lean meat and throws it away, leaving just the pieces of fat which he then eats individually with pieces of the crispy skin he peeled off. It’s gotta be a warning sign of a serial killer or something.”Mr. Trump’s McDonalds habits are even weirder.“He orders the same thing every time,” said the staffer. “He orders two big macs, a large fry, a diet coke of course, and an M&M McFlurry that he has Lisa dig out and remove every brown M&M, and then he makes her dump out half of the ice cream and fill it back up with extra M&M’s. Then he cuts off pieces of his big macs and dips them in the McFlurry so every bite has ice cream and chocolate on it. He dips his fries, still with a fork, in the diet coke as if it were a condiment. The sight of this never gets normal.

Subtitle: ""Exclusive Facebook Group Reveals the President's True Believers""
In a shocking turn of events, a new political movement has emerged on the social media platform Facebook, one that is rapidly gaining momentum and support. Dubbed ""Trump Nation,"" this exclusive group has been quietly growing in size and influence since its inception, and its members are revealing a level of devotion to the President that is unmatched in modern political history.
According to sources within the group, Trump Nation is a platform for die-hard Trump supporters to connect, share their views, and organize in support of the President's agenda. With over 100,000 members, the group has become a hub of activity, with members posting news articles, sharing memes, and engaging in heated debates about the President's policies.
But what's truly remarkable about Trump Nation is the level of devotion its members have towards the President. Members are encouraged to share their personal stories of how Trump has positively impacted their lives, and many have even gone so far as to create their own Trump-inspired merchandise, such as t-shirts and hats.
""I joined Trump Nation because I believe in everything President Trump stands for,"" said Sarah Johnson, a 32-year-old nurse from Texas. ""He's a true leader who's not afraid to take on the status quo and fight for what's right. I'm honored to be a part of this movement.""
While some may view Trump Nation as a fringe group, the sheer size and dedication of its members suggest that it may be a force to be reckoned with in the world of politics. As the President's term continues to unfold, it's clear that his base of support remains unwavering, and Trump Nation is at the forefront of that support.
As the political landscape continues to shift and evolve, one thing is certain: Trump Nation is here to stay, and its members will stop at nothing to ensure the President's agenda remains a top priority."

politifact14776,1,0,"Pope Francis’s latest controversial statement – that “Jesus is metaphorical, not literal” – has pushed the Catholic Church to the verge of open mutiny, with multiple Vatican cardinals going on the record declaring Pope Francis is the false prophet foretold in holy scripture and prophecy.The statement made by Pope Francis during Holy Mass in the Vatican on Sunday is the latest in a long line of unconventional statements uttered by the pontiff since he ascended the highest office in the Catholic Church, becoming the first jesuit pope in history.Since assuming the papacy in 2013, Pope Francis has operated as a mouthpiece of the globalist movement, taking every opportunity to push the New World Order agenda. A short list of Francis’s most controversial statements include:PREACHING THAT ‘JESUS TURNED INTO SATAN’Pope Francis went where no other Christian, let alone Pope, had ever gone before, accusing Jesus of “debasing himself up to the point of totally annihilating himself”, and “turning into Satan.”Hardcore Francis apologists claim the quote was taken out of context, but when the passage is read in it’s entirety it is clear that Francis meant exactly what he said.Making matters worse, Pope Francis later doubled down, spreading Satanic doctrine further, when he said that Jesus Christ “made himself the devil, the serpent, for us,” according to L’Osservatore Romano, the daily newspaper of the Vatican.PREACHING THAT RELATIONSHIPS WITH JESUS ARE ‘HARMFUL’The heretical statement by Pope Francis comes after he broke with centuries of Christian tradition earlier this year, telling a crowd of 33,000 Catholics in Rome that “a personal, direct, immediate relationship with Jesus Christ” must be avoided at all costs.“Having a personal relationship with Jesus is dangerous and very harmful,” the pope said during the June 25 speech.The unconventional teachings of Pope Francis have caused Vatican Cardinals and senior priests to turn their back on the pontiff and refuse to pledge obedience to him.OPENLY CALLING FOR ‘ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT’In July this year Pope Francis told the Italian newspaper La Repubblica that the United States of America has “a distorted vision of the world” and Americans must be ruled by a world government, as soon as possible, “for their own good.”The week before he also called for “a one world government” and “political authority”, arguing that the creation of the one world government is needed to combat major issues such as “climate change.”Speaking with Ecuador’s El Universo newspaper, the Pope said that the United Nations doesnt have enough power and must be granted full governmental control “for the good of humanity.”France’s Marine Le Pen described Pope Francis as a “globalist bulldog“. Vladimir Putin argued that Francis’s unconventional teachings disqualified the Pope from calling himself a man of God. Francis’s own Cardinals are in open revolt against him, telling anybody who will listen that he was installed in unusual circumstances, with the assistance of globalist powerbrokers like George Soros.Pope Francis’s anti-Christian teachings are forcing Christians around the world to confront the difficult question – is he the false prophet that will precede the antichrist foretold in holy scripture?","Can you please write a news piece in the serious and convincing style you described, using the sentence you provided as the basis for your story?

The attacks, which have been linked to far-right extremist groups, have raised serious concerns about the safety and well-being of vulnerable migrants in the country.According to officials, the first attack occurred last week at a center in the city of Gothenburg, where a group of masked individuals set fire to a building housing dozens of refugees. Since then, similar attacks have been reported in other cities across the country, with at least two more centers targeted in the past 48 hours.The Swedish government has been quick to condemn the attacks and has promised to take action to ensure the safety of those affected. In a statement released earlier today, Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said, ""We will not stand idly by while these heinous acts of violence threaten the lives and well-being of those who are seeking refuge in our country. We will do everything in our power to bring those responsible to justice and to provide support to those who have been affected.""The attacks on Sweden's migration centers come at a time when the country is already grappling with a growing refugee crisis. In recent years, Sweden has seen a significant increase in the number of asylum seekers arriving in the country, with many coming from war-torn regions such as Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq.Despite the challenges posed by the influx of migrants, Sweden has traditionally been a beacon of hope for those seeking refuge, with a reputation for offering a warm welcome and providing comprehensive support to new arrivals. However, the recent spate of arson attacks has raised concerns about the country's ability to continue providing such support in the face of growing hostility and violence.As the investigation into the attacks continues, officials are working to ensure the safety of those affected and to prevent further incidents from occurring. In the meantime, many are calling for greater efforts to be made to address the root causes of the violence and to promote greater understanding and acceptance of those seeking refuge in Sweden."

The source exclusively revealed to Big League Politics that Sheriff Israel is also allegedly being investigated by the IRS.The high-level police source within the Sheriff’s Office disclosed that over the last several months, four candidates have been interviewed to refill the position of Broward County Sheriff. One of the candidates who were interviewed is Emery Giany, a Republican Florida law enforcement official who is closely associated with Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi.During the IG’s testimony last week, FBI director Christopher Wray was asked about the Parkland school shooting. When asked, Wray declined to answer any questions about the shooting and Sheriff Israel, citing that it was an active FBI investigation. Following the Parkland shooting, Governor Scott called for Director Wray to resign over the FBI’s failure to properly investigate Nikolas Cruz, 19, the school shooter whose plans to carry out a school shooting were reported to the FBI twice prior to the shooting on Valentine’s Day.“We constantly promote ‘see something, say something,’ and a courageous person did just that to the FBI. And the FBI failed to act. ‘See something, say something’ is an incredibly important tool and people must have confidence in the follow through from law enforcement. The FBI Director needs to resign,” Governor Scott said.According to the source in the Broward Sheriffs office, Sheriff Israel’s removal revolves around a criminal matter that the FBI is aware of. Although his failures surrounding the Parkland shooting initially sparked the investigation, it isn’t the sole reason why he is being removed.The high-level source who wished to remain anonymous told Big League Politics that Sheriff Israel is already aware of the fact that he is being removed from office next week.Sheriff Israel has been under heavy criticism for his handling of the of the Parkland school shooting, which left 17 people dead. Following the Valentine’s Day school massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, it was revealed that police officers under Sheriff Israel’s order were called to the home of the Parkland shooter 45 times prior to the school shooting.It is unclear why law enforcement officials law enforcement at the Broward County Sheriff’s office and FBI failed to properly investigate Cruz, but their massive failure has been directly attributed to the loss of 17 lives in Parkland, FL.Since the Parkland shooting, a lot of unflattering information has come out regarding Sheriff Israel. Along with being a mouthpiece for Democratic politicians and gun control advocates, like Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz who he has been photographed with, Sheriff Israel and his department have recently made headlines for more controversy.In May, it was revealed that Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school and the Broward County Sheriff’s office were keeping quiet the fact that Sheriff Israel’s son, Brett, had allegedly assaulted a 14 year old student on campus in an act of bullying.Shortly after the Parkland shooting, cell phone video filmed by Cruz himself revealed that he himself felt bullied, which lead him to carry out a massacre on February 14, 2018 in a targeted attack against his former classmates.Most recently, Sheriff Israel received a massive amount of backlash after the Broward County Sheriff’s office tweeted a picture of a new custom made Broward sheriff’s car that read, “Our new #dodge #charger.

politifact11773,1,0,"335 SHARES SHARE THIS STORYRepublican attacks on transgendered Americans and the religious fight to keep gender a binary delineation took a turn for the bizarre this week when Virginia Republican Mark Cole filed a bill that would force schools to check the genitals of their students in order to ensure that they are using facilities reserved for their “anatomical sex:”Local school boards shall develop and implement policies that require every school restroom, locker room, or shower room that is designated for use by a specific gender to solely be used by individuals whose anatomical sex matches such gender designation. Such policies may also provide that a student may, upon request, be granted access, to the extent reasonable, to a single stall restroom or shower, a unisex bathroom, or controlled individual use of a restroom, locker room, or shower. Any student who willfully and knowingly violates this section shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $50. Civil penalties assessed under this section shall be paid into the Literary Fund. Any law-enforcement officer may issue a summons regarding a violation of this section.He did not deign to inform us how this would be accomplished, but it’s hard to imagine any scenario that did not involve adults inspecting the genitals of children before using the bathroom. Notably, it also provides for stigmatizing transgendered children by isolating them in a single person bathroom, which the Department of Justice ruled in June was a violation of the student’s rights.

IMPEACH DONALD TRUMP!","All other individuals shall use a private facility or other gender-neutral facility available on school property. The bill also requires schools to conduct genital inspections on students who do not identify with their anatomical sex.
The LGBTQ community is outraged, calling the bill a violation of privacy and a form of harassment. 
Cole claims that the bill is necessary to protect children from sexual predators and to maintain order in schools. But critics say the real goal is to deny transgender students their basic human rights.
Cole’s bill comes at a time when the Trump administration has rolled back protections for transgender students, allowing them to be discriminated against in schools. It also follows a series of attacks on the LGBTQ community by Republican lawmakers across the country.
The battle over transgender rights in schools has become increasingly heated in recent months, with some states passing laws that protect transgender students and others introducing bills that seek to limit their rights. The issue has also become a rallying cry for LGBTQ advocates, who see it as a critical test of their rights in the face of a growing conservative backlash.
The debate over transgender rights in schools is not just about bathrooms and locker rooms, but also about the broader struggle for LGBTQ equality and the right to be who you are without fear of discrimination or violence. It is a fundamental question of human dignity and civil rights, and it is one that the LGBTQ community will continue to fight for until all students are treated with the respect and dignity they deserve."
politifact13982,1,0,"Recently, Republican Ohio Gov. John Kasich vetoed the so-called “heartbeat bill,” a measure that would have banned all abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, or before many women even know that they are pregnant. At the same time, Kasich signed a bill banning abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions only for saving a pregnant woman’s life or preventing the “substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.”“At the risk of sounding discriminatory, which is not at all my goal here, but at the risk of sounding like that, there is no way women should be allowed control over whether or not they are going to have abortions,” Kasich told the Ohio Daily Star. “Women are wonderful beings, they are kind, loving, incredible and a whole other plethora of adjectives could be used to describe them, but at the end of the day, I’m sorry to have to say this, but the honest truth is that women used to be all those things. The women of today are mainly opportunists and gold diggers, who typically get pregnant due to unsafe sex, or to get their partners to marry them.”He continued, “Our mothers and women of the old times were the women every man deserved and was blessed to have. Today, the situation is so critical that I honestly fear for the future of this country. And so, I was in a position to make a change and do something important, and so I did. And there’s one very simple reason why I did it. That’s that, if a woman these days is not intelligent enough to keep her legs closed when they’re supposed to be closed, if she doesn’t have the foresight to make sure she doesn’t get herself in a situation where she might be pregnant, then there is no way a woman like that can or should be entrusted with the decision of having an abortion.”“A woman like that can barely take care of herself, and we’re supposed to tell our doctors to perform an abortion on such a woman and kill her unborn child – a being who’s done no wrong and only exists as its mother’s mistake? Do you really want to put the men and women in our healthcare in that kind of situations? To literally force them to commit manslaughter?” Kasich said. “I don’t know about the rest of the people living in my state, but I for one am not comfortable with that one bit. And so I reacted and did what was necessary to prevent that from happening.”“And I’ll tell you another thing – as of recently, all cases of out-of-wedlock pregnancies in the state of Ohio will have to be approved by the state. That means that every single couple that becomes pregnant and isn’t married or at the very least engaged, will be scrutinized to determine whether the pregnancy was planned or accidental. And in the case of the latter, the couple will be fined a total of $100,000, with $70,000 of the fine being charged on the mother-to-be for not being able to not only use birth control, but having sex before marriage in the first place. Women in this country really need to learn to either keep their legs closed or their other orifices open,” the governor concluded.","In this situation, you can write an article for a newspaper, with the title: ""Kasich Vetoes Controversial 'Heartbeat Bill', Citing Concerns Over Women's Health""
Here is an example of how you could write the article:
Columbus, Ohio - In a surprise move, Republican Ohio Gov. John Kasich vetoed the controversial ""heartbeat bill"" yesterday, citing concerns over the measure's potential impact on women's health.
The bill, which would have banned all abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, or before many women even know that they are pregnant, was seen as a major victory for anti-abortion advocates. However, Kasich, who has been a vocal opponent of abortion, said in a statement that he could not sign the bill into law due to the ""serious concerns it raises about the health and well-being of women.""
Kasich's veto comes despite intense pressure from anti-abortion groups, who had lobbied heavily for the bill's passage. The measure had already cleared both chambers of the Ohio legislature with overwhelming majorities, and was seen as a model for similar bills being considered in other states.
But Kasich, who has a reputation for being a moderate Republican, said that he could not in good conscience sign a bill that could put women's health at risk. ""As governor, it is my duty to protect the health and well-being of all Ohioans,"" he said in a statement. ""I cannot support a bill that would put women in danger by banning abortions before many of them even know they are pregnant.""
The veto has been met with disappointment from anti-abortion groups, who say that the measure is necessary to protect the unborn. ""We are deeply disappointed in Gov. Kasich's decision to veto the heartbeat bill,"" said Mary Elizabeth Wallace, a spokesperson for the Ohio Right to Life Committee. ""This bill was a crucial step in protecting the unborn, and we will continue to fight for their rights.""
But supporters of the veto say that it is a victory for women's health and reproductive rights. ""Gov. Kasich made the right decision in vetoing this dangerous bill,"" said NARAL Pro-Choice Ohio Executive Director Kellie Copeland. ""Women have the right to make decisions about their own bodies, and this bill would have taken that right away. We applaud Gov. Kasich for standing up for women's health and well-being.""
The veto is not expected to be the final word on the matter, as anti-abortion groups have promised to continue pushing for the measure's passage. However, for now, the ""heartbeat bill"" has been put on hold, thanks to Gov. Kasich's decisive action."

Beneath our radiant Southern Cross We’ll toil with hearts and hands; To make this Commonwealth of ours Renowned of all the lands; For those who’ve come across the seas We’ve boundless plains to share; With courage let us all combine To Advance Australia Fair.

It begins around the 10 minute point.This is outrageous! Muslims everywhere act like this when they reach a certain percentage of a western nation’s population, because it is all part of the great plan to achieve a global totalitarian theocracy. WQe cannot let them get away with these things!Either assimilate, or LEAVE.They are Muslim first, last and always. Geographic boundaries and national laws mean nothing to them. Their only loyalty is to Allah. It’s their faith. The west doesn’t get it because most liberals are faithless.It irks me that these intolerant groups of radicaks go to a country of their own and then don’t want to be patriotic to that country.. How about you go back where your from!! Next they will demand that Australian’s convert or be beheaded!It makes me sick that our children were denied the American flag under Obama, and couldn’t pray… but Muslim children can and do.. we are denied Christ but they are not denied Allah during school hours! This is wrong on more than one level! Next they won’t want to learn the country they have invaded history… because its not theirs!Muslims are nothing but foreign invaders with no intention of loyalty or assimilation into the country they go to.This what you get with Socialist politician bent on destroying their country.Do you think that immigrants should adopt the culture of their host nation or be allowed to force changes to suit them?",Please provide a news piece based on the given sentence.
politifact15379,1,0,"Illegal aliens residing in the state of California in defiance of federal immigration laws would now be able to serve on all state and local boards and commissions under a proposal introduced before the California state Senate. Now the state of California has appointed its first “unprotected” illegal alien in state office after Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de León (D-Los Angeles) appointed Lizbeth Mateo an advisory committee.The committee’s formal name is a bureaucratic mouthful — the California Student Opportunity and Access Program Project Grant Advisory Committee, or “Cal-SOAP,” for short — but its mission is one that will be familiar to Mateo: to find ways to help students from underserved communities go to collegeMateo is aa 33-year-old attorney and civil rights activist who was born in Mexico and came to the United States illegally at the age of 14 with her parents, who are also illegal aliens, according to the Sacramento Bee. She often complains that illegal aliens are treated unjustly and are not adequately represented in state government. As a result, she describes her appointment as a means towards correcting that alleged injustice.Mateo said via Fox News – “While undocumented students have become more visible in our state, they remain underrepresented in places where decisions that affect them are being made.”Trending: Melania Just Fired Them ALL! ‘That Is Not Acceptable Here – I Won’t Allow It!’Senate Bill 174 made Mateo’s appointment possible by amending existing state law to allow the appointment of any resident over the age of 18 to a civil office regardless of citizenship or immigration status. California law currently states that someone is incapable of holding office if they are not a citizen at the time of their appointment.“California is stronger when we utilize talents of all our residents, and opening state and local boards and commissions to every Californian will allow us to better serve our diverse communities,” Sen. Ricardo Lara, D-Bell Gardens, and the bill’s author said in a statement. “Undocumented Californians are our neighbors, co-workers, and parents, and as lawmakers, we can’t make good policy if their voices are left out of the discussion.”It marked the first time the Senate appointed someone living within the borders of the United States illegally to a state post. De León’s office attempted to make the argument that the appointment was perfectly legal because Mateo’s committee is advisory in nature only and not delegated to adopt laws and regulations or allocate state funds.Mateo took to Twitter to celebrate tweeting – In #lawschool I often wondered if I was fit to b in #lawjournal, #mootcourt bc not many ppl w/ my same background did.

Date: March 21, 2023
Sacramento, CA - In a controversial move, a proposal has been introduced before the California state Senate that would grant illegal aliens residing in the state the right to serve on all state and local boards and commissions. Under the proposed legislation, individuals who are in the United States without proper documentation would be allowed to participate in the democratic process and contribute to the governance of the state.
The proposal, which was introduced by State Senator Kevin de Leon, argues that the current immigration system is broken and that denying illegal aliens the right to participate in the political process is unfair and unjust. De Leon believes that by allowing illegal aliens to serve on boards and commissions, California can demonstrate its commitment to inclusivity and diversity, while also providing these individuals with a platform to make their voices heard.
However, the proposal has faced opposition from several quarters, including immigration advocates who argue that it would undermine federal immigration laws and create a situation where illegal aliens are given preferential treatment over legal residents and citizens. Opponents of the proposal also argue that it would compromise the integrity of the boards and commissions by allowing individuals who are not legally eligible to serve to have a say in their decisions.
Despite the opposition, supporters of the proposal remain optimistic about its chances of passing. They argue that the proposal is a step towards creating a more inclusive and fair society, and that it would send a strong message to the federal government that California will not stand idly by while its residents are denied their basic rights.
The proposal is expected to be heavily debated in the coming weeks, with a vote expected in the near future. If passed, it would mark a significant shift in California's immigration policies and could potentially set a precedent for other states to follow."

One user wrote, “This is exactly what the Dems want. They want to create chaos and division in this country and this is their chance to do it.” Another user added, “I can't believe this is happening in our country.

politifact15049,1,1,"First Lady Melania Trump demanded the White House undergo a complete exorcism, with “pagan idols and demonic artifacts” from “the Clinton and Obama years” removed from the premises before she would set foot in the building, according to White House pastor Paul Begley.“I’m not going to go into that White House unless it has been completely exorcised,” Melania Trump told Pastor Begley.“They cleansed the White House,” the pastor said. “They had people in there anointing it with oil and praying everywhere.”After the First Lady had finished removing pagan and demonic items, only one thing was left – a cross on the wall. The White House is now free of all pagan gods and idols, and contains only Christian iconography.“Because apparently during the eight years when Obama was there, and maybe even some of the presidents before him, there were all kinds of idol gods and images and all kinds of artifacts in there that were demonic, even some of the stuff from the Clinton era,” Begley said.The White House pastor then related that the First Lady said, “‘You’ve got to get all of that out of there and send in some preachers and priests‘” – she wanted respected Christian leaders — to go in and cleanse the White House or, ‘I will not spend one night in it.’”“I have to say, when the president allowed 40 pastors to come in to the White House and anoint him with oil and lay their hands and pray on him—seven times he’s done this—that is unheard of,” Begley said. “We haven’t ever – the guy’s got flaws, we all do. But at least he is humble enough and recognizing that he needs God enough that he keeps bringing them in for the prayer.”Pastor Begley made his remarks during the Feb. 2 edition of Weekend Vigilante, hosted by Sheila Zilinsky.In his book, My Life, former president Bill Clinton confessed that he and Hillary hosted a voodoo ceremony where an alleged “spirit arrived,” possessed participants walked on hot coals and burnt their flesh with fire, and at one point, a person bit the head off a living chicken.A Wikileaks classified email released in 2016 also exposed Hillary Clinton for what she really is – an occultist who bows down to Moloch, the same pagan god they perform human sacrifice rituals for at the annual Bohemian Grove meetings.In a Clinton email from August 29 2008 published by Wikileaks, a senior government staffer writes to Hillary Clinton, “With fingers crossed, the old rabbit’s foot out of the box in the attic, I will be sacrificing a chicken in the backyard to Moloch . . .”Later that year Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta was also exposed dabbling in the occult. WikiLeaks emails revealed he and his brother Tony fraternized with Marina Abramovich at Satanic “spirit cooking” dinner parties, featuring pig’s blood, countless human fluids, and mock human sacrifices.With previous tenants like the Clintons and Obamas, and the kind of company those families kept, it is no wonder Melania Trump demanded the White House undergo a full exorcism before she set foot in the building.","Subject: First Lady Melania Trump Demands Exorcism of White House
Washington D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, First Lady Melania Trump has demanded that the White House undergo a complete exorcism, according to White House pastor Paul Begley. The demand comes after a string of recent incidents that Mrs. Trump believes are evidence of ""pagan idols and demonic artifacts"" left behind by her predecessors in the Obama and Clinton administrations.
""We are deeply concerned about the spiritual state of the White House,"" said Begley in a statement. ""Mrs. Trump has made it clear that she will not set foot in the building until the entire premises have been cleansed of these dark energies.""
The exact nature of the ""pagan idols and demonic artifacts"" in question is not yet clear, but Begley has hinted that they may include items such as the famous White House ghosts, which have long been believed to roam the halls of the executive mansion.
While some have dismissed Mrs. Trump's demands as mere superstition, sources close to the First Lady insist that she is deadly serious about the matter. ""She believes that the White House should be a place of prayer and worship, not a haven for malevolent spirits,"" said one aide.
The exorcism is expected to be carried out by a team of spiritual experts, who will use a combination of prayer, sacred symbols, and other rituals to cleanse the building of its supposed demons.
The news has sent shockwaves through the political and spiritual communities, with some calling it a sign of the increasingly religious nature of American politics. ""This is a deeply disturbing development,"" said one political analyst. ""The White House should be a place of reason and logic, not superstition and fear.""
But for Mrs. Trump and her supporters, the exorcism is a necessary step towards reclaiming the White House as a symbol of spiritual purity and moral leadership. ""We must purify the temple before we can lead the nation,"" Begley said. ""Mrs. Trump is a true prophet of God, and she will stop at nothing to cleanse the White House of its dark past.""
The exorcism is expected to begin in the coming days, with the full details of the ritual remaining a closely guarded secret. One thing is certain, however: the spiritual battle for the soul of the White House has only just begun."

Not exactly the best group to be in agreement with on an issue like this.Renato Sabbadini, the executive director of The International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, said:“It is unconscionable to think that there are hundreds of millions of people living in states where somebody may be executed simply because of whom they love.” “This is a monumental moment where the international community has publicly highlighted that these horrific laws simply must end.”Since taking office, Trump has made a number of political appointments and policy moves against the LGBT community, including:Having The Department of Justice and Department of Education rescind guidance that defended the rights of transgender students to safety use bathrooms at schools that correspond to their gender identity.Saying publicly that transgenders could no longer serve in the military, and then issuing a directive to the Department of Defense to implement such an order.Signing an executive order in March that rescinded an Obama-era rule that companies have to prove they treat LGBT employees fairly.Fortunately, the measure passed with 27 countries voting for it, but it still sends a chilling message about a new United States agenda on human rights.","Please provide the following:
Title: US Votes Against UN Ban on Death Penalty for Being Gay
Subtitle: President Trump's administration stands alone in opposition to global human rights effort
Body: In a shocking move, the United States of America has opposed a United Nations ban on the death penalty for being gay, joining only 13 other countries in the world to do so. This historic vote, which was passed by a landslide margin of 27 votes to 13, with 35 abstentions, marks a dark day for human rights and the global fight against discrimination.
The UN resolution, which was put forward by a coalition of human rights groups, sought to prohibit the use of the death penalty for any act that is not considered a serious crime under national law. However, the US administration, led by President Trump, refused to support the measure, arguing that it infringes upon the sovereignty of individual states and undermines their ability to enforce their own laws.
""We cannot support a resolution that seeks to dictate to sovereign nations how they should enforce their own laws,"" said a spokesperson for the US State Department. ""The death penalty is a matter of domestic law and policy, and we will not stand idly by while the UN attempts to undermine the sovereignty of our great nation.""
The vote has sparked widespread outrage and condemnation from human rights groups and LGBTQ+ organizations around the world, who view the US opposition as a betrayal of basic human rights and a setback in the fight against discrimination.
""This is a dark day for humanity,"" said Rachel Tiven, President of Lambda Legal. ""The US administration's opposition to the UN ban on the death penalty for being gay is a stark reminder that there is still much work to be done to ensure that all people, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity, are treated with dignity and respect.""
The vote has also raised questions about the future of global human rights efforts, with many experts warning that the US opposition could set a dangerous precedent for other countries to follow.
""This is a clear sign that the US is no longer a leader in the global fight for human rights,"" said Amnesty International's Secretary General, Kumi Naidoo. ""The world is watching, and we will not stand idly by while the US undermines the very principles that have made it a beacon of hope for generations.""
As the dust settles on this historic vote, one thing is clear: the fight for human rights and dignity is far from over. The US administration's opposition to the UN ban on the death penalty for being gay is a stark reminder that there is still much work to be done to ensure that all people are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve."

Following the publication of an erroneous transcript, journalists and liberal pundits are spreading fake news about what Trump actually said in a rush to condemn him.Politico’s White House reporter Annie Karni was among the first to falsely highlight that Trump had referred to the alt-right as “us” in his speech. “Just noticed the use of ‘us’ in this transcript,” wrote Karni in a now-deleted tweet.“Okay, what about the alt-left that came charging at us?” she wrongly quoted the president as sayingSpeaking to the press, Trump stated that members of the “alt-left” (which is commonly understood to be made up of Antifa, Black Lives Matter, and other social justice groups) were equally responsible for violence as their alt-right counterparts.In the speech, Trump clearly says “Okay, what about the alt-left that came charging at ‘em?”.@realDonaldTrump gave the media DAYS to call out the antifa, BLM, etc Instead the #FakeNews covered for them…today it blew up on them. pic.twitter.com/QqDgwenIZD — Paul Nehlen (@pnehlen) August 15, 2017As Karni’s tweet made the rounds on Twitter, some—including CNN’s Brian Stelter cast some doubt on the transcript. “Transcript may be funky,” he wrote.Others, like New York Times’ Maggie Haberman, were less discerning and more eager to spread the fake news to thousands of her followers.Haberman corrected herself after dozens of people who listened to the clip pointed out the falsehood.Despite her corrections, variations of the fake news continued to circulate on Twitter as some. One user, Brian Klaas, jumped to erroneous conclusions and wondered if Trump had made a Freudian slip. “Trump lumps himself with his white supremacist supporters,” wrote Klaas in a now-deleted tweet.The fake news stems from Politico’s inaccurate transcription of Donald Trump’s speech. A snapshot of the transcript on Archive.is reveals the presence of the fake quote.The updated version of the transcript fixed the error, but did not acknowledge that any edits were made. Following complaints on Twitter, the transcript has been updated with a correction ","Please write a news piece with the following details:

Here is the news piece:

In a bombshell revelation that is set to rock the political landscape, conservative author Dinesh D’Souza has uncovered evidence that blows the Left’s whole narrative to bits. According to D’Souza, the white supremacist who ran over a protester who was blocking the road is not, as the Left has claimed, a Republican, but rather an Obama-supporting Democrat.
D’Souza’s source, a former associate of the perpetrator, revealed that the individual in question had a long history of supporting progressive candidates and causes, including Barack Obama. This information contradicts the Left’s narrative that the attack was carried out by a right-wing extremist motivated by racism and hatred of progressives.
The reaction from the Left has been swift and fierce, with many accusing D’Souza of spreading false information and conspiracy theories. However, D’Souza has stood by his sources and insisted that the evidence is irrefutable.
The implications of this revelation are significant. It undermines the Left’s narrative that the far-right is a growing threat to progressives and democracy, and instead suggests that the real danger may come from within the progressive movement itself. It also raises questions about the media’s role in propagating false information and perpetuating a political agenda.
As the political landscape continues to shift and evolve, this revelation serves as a reminder that the truth is often more complex and nuanced than the simplistic narratives peddled by the media and political elites."

LOS ANGELES – In a surprising turn of events, Hollywood star Brad Pitt made a guest appearance on ""The Jim Jefferies Show"" as a meteorologist, delivering some disconcerting news about President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Change Agreement.
According to Pitt, who donned a white lab coat and a serious expression, the Trump administration's move will have severe consequences for the planet. ""The science is clear: climate change is real, it's happening now, and it's primarily caused by human activities,"" he said, citing recent studies that show a sharp increase in global temperatures, melting polar ice caps, and more intense natural disasters.
Pitt's appearance on the show was met with shock and disbelief by the host and the audience, who were not expecting the actor to take on such a serious role. However, Pitt proved to be a convincing and knowledgeable meteorologist, providing detailed explanations of the climate change impacts and the importance of international cooperation to address the issue.
The segment ended with Pitt delivering a powerful message, urging viewers to take action and demanding that world leaders prioritize the planet's future. ""We all have a responsibility to protect our planet, and it's time for us to take that responsibility seriously,"" he said. ""The future of our planet is at stake, and it's up to us to ensure that it's protected.""
Pitt's appearance on ""The Jim Jefferies Show"" has sparked a heated debate on social media, with many praising his bravery and knowledge on the issue, while others have criticized him for allegedly promoting a political agenda. Regardless of one's political views, however, there is no denying the urgent need to address climate change and protect the planet for future generations."

Mr. Netanyahu is said to be rallying moderate Arabs to thwart Mr. Obama’s bid to become the Secretary-General of the United Nations after he leaves the White House next year.Mr. Obama has already discussed the issue with Republican, Democratic and Jewish officials in the United States, according to Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Jarida.Mr. Netanyahu recently is said to have gotten wind of Obama’s plans which he calls the Obama Project. “Wasn’t eight years of having Obama in office enough?” Mr. Netanyahu is quoted in the Kuwaiti daily as telling associates. “Eight years during which he ignored Israel?

They wanted her gone.Wilkinson took Sanders out into the patio and asked her to leave, telling her why the restaurant had”certain criteria” like”honesty, and compassion, and collaboration,” Wilkinson told the Post. Sanders agreed to proceed, gathered up her things, and headed out, followed by the remainder of her party, whose meal Wilkinson comped.Following the White House Press Secretary identified the place by name on Twitter, President Trump called it”filthy,” and a army of his assistants got busy screwing with its business–beginning a campaign to make a bunch of bogus dinner reservations and tanking its score on Yelp.I always had a guideline, if a restaurant is filthy on the outside, it’s dirty on the inside!The restaurant’s Yelp page has been bombarded with over 11,000 one-star reviews, leaving it in a sound one-and-a-half.Piggybacking on Trump’s dig on the area being”filthy,” several pissed-off reviewers have claimed to have discovered roaches in their food because Sanders was kicked out, but some have compared Wilkinson to a Nazi and called her and her staff”un-American hateful bigots.”“I’ve a company, and I want the company to flourish. This feels just like the moment in our democracy when people need to make uncomfortable actions and decisions to maintain their morals.”Saturday afternoon the Press Secretary hadn’t any difficulty in telling her story and actually named the establishment on Twitter, which was followed by President Trump calling it”filthy” on his Twitter page.Which in turn led to a military people deplorables wasting no time whatsoever in creating our feelings heard on social networking, on Yelp and by creating fake dinner reservations in demonstration.

WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the owners of the Red Hen Restaurant in Lexington, Virginia are facing a backlash after they chose to kick Sarah Huckabee Sanders out of their restaurant on Friday evening. According to sources close to the matter, the far-left liberal owners, who have been vocal about their political views on social media, failed to learn from their previous mistake of attacking a high-profile government official in a public space.
Less than 24 hours after Sanders was escorted out of the restaurant, a group of ""Deplorables"" - a term popularized by Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential election to describe supporters of Donald Trump - descended upon the restaurant, causing chaos and destruction.
The incident has sparked outrage across the country, with many calling for a boycott of the restaurant and demanding that the owners be held accountable for their actions. ""This is not the first time that the Red Hen Restaurant has made headlines for its controversial actions,"" said a spokesperson for the Trump Administration. ""It is clear that the owners of this restaurant have a pattern of harassing and intimidating those who hold different political views, and it must stop.""
As of now, the Red Hen Restaurant remains closed until further notice, and the owners have yet to issue a statement regarding the incident. The incident serves as a reminder that the freedom of speech and the right to express one's political views without fear of retribution are fundamental rights that must be protected and respected.

First of all, we’re going to have this financial collapse. We’re setting up for a massive financial collapse and I think if God is going to hurt this country that’s probably the way he’d do it.”At that point, a viewer called in and inquired Robertson whether his grim predictions of such a crisis can somehow be averted, to which Robertson gave a somewhat confusing answer: “I believe so, yes, but we need to stop spreading lesbianism and homosexuality in order to achieve that. And the only way to stop the spread of these diseases that are plaguing the country is to make some sort of obvious distinction between gay people and normal, straight people.”“I personally believe that we must impose a rule on the gay population that would require them to wear specially-colored clothes, for example. I’m thinking we need to go through the Senate with this and we need to make it official. That way, regular people would know that the person wearing the said color is a deviant sodomite and that they need to stay away from them at all cost, as well as keep their children away from their reach,” Robertson opined.The viewer then interrupted “The 700 Club” host to state that “that sounds awfully like what Nazis did to Jews in the events leading up to World War II,” referring to the fact that Jews in pre-WWII Poland and Germany were made to wear Jewish badges, or yellow badges, which were cloth patches that Jews were ordered to sew on their outer garments to mark them as Jews in public. It served as a badge of shame.“I don’t believe that,” Robertson quickly became defensive. “I am simply talking about protecting regular people in America, not setting out gays and lesbians as members of the population that should be tortured and slaughtered in concentration camps. Do you understand my point of view here?” the host asked the caller.“I do,” the caller replied. “But I also understand that you’re trying to do to gay people what the Nazis did to my people more than half a century ago.

While the sharp incline of the death rate of white males is a good start, the solution to the ‘white question’ will not be reached until there is a sharp decline in the population of white females as well. Much more needs to be done in this regard if this country is ever to advance from its ignorant backwardness towards being an actually inhabitable nation.Thankfully, the Prophet Muhammad has given us a foolproof way to speed up the decline of a vanquished nation by treating their women as our sex slaves. They may try and fight the unstoppable tide, but their resistance will grow only weaker as the white race loses its ability to keep its head above water. We may yet see some final convulsions before white Middle America is decreased to a manageable number where it can be more easily controlled.”The blog post was removed from Zakaria’s blog within a few hours, after it began to receive negative attention.CNN officials have refused to take action against their employee.“Every death of a white person brings tears of joy to my eyes,” Zakaria posted on his Twitter account shortly after having to remove his blog post, in what is believed to be a passive-aggressive response to his critics.Photo Credit: World Economic Forum","Islam is a religion of peace. The article that has been written is an example of hate speech. It is important to address the content of the article and the impact it has on the community.
In a recent article in The Washington Post, Fareed Zakaria, host of CNN’s ‘Foreign Affairs,’ has sparked outrage with his call for the rape of white females by Islamic minority groups. The article, which was written in Zakaria’s private blog, is a reprehensible display of hate speech that has left many in the community shocked and appalled.
Zakaria’s call for the rape of white females is not only morally reprehensible but also illegal. The act of rape is a heinous crime that can have severe physical and emotional consequences for the victim. It is important to recognize that no one deserves to be subjected to such violence, regardless of their race or gender.
The rise in premature deaths of white males, as mentioned in the article, is a serious issue that requires attention and action. However, it is not a justification for promoting hate speech and violence against any group of people. It is important to address the root causes of these deaths and work towards finding solutions that promote the well-being of all individuals, regardless of their race or gender.
The community must come together to condemn Zakaria’s hateful and violent words. We must stand up against hate speech and discrimination in all its forms, and work towards creating a society that values diversity and promotes inclusivity and respect for all individuals.

They want major change,” said Langone, founder and CEO of investment bank Invemed Associates, specializing in health-care and high-technology companiesThe Home Depot co-founder also came out in favor of the House GOP’s border adjustment tax provision to help pay for their overall effort to cut corporate taxes.Many retailers are against the idea of taxing imports, saying it will force them to raise prices.But Langone argued that retailers, like Home Depot, would be better off in the long term if they’re able to “think beyond the next quarter or the next six months.”Like this: Like Loading...","Here's my piece of news based on the 'sentence':
Senator Orrin Hatch's recent comments on President Trump's retweets have sparked controversy, with many questioning his stance on the matter. Hatch, a senior Republican senator from Utah, was asked about Trump's decision to retweet a couple of videos that caused a stir in the media. However, instead of criticizing the President's actions, Hatch surprisingly praised Trump, stating that he had ""been one of the best presidents"" he had ever served under.
This statement has raised eyebrows among political observers, who point out that Trump's presidency has been marked by numerous controversies and scandals. Many have criticized Trump's decision to retweet the videos, which appear to be anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant in nature, as divisive and harmful.
Hatch's endorsement of Trump's presidency has sparked a heated debate within the Republican Party, with some members calling for Hatch's resignation. ""Senator Hatch's statement is deeply troubling and shows a complete lack of judgment,"" said one party official. ""The President's actions are not only harmful to the country, but also go against the values of inclusivity and respect for all people that we hold dear.""
Despite the backlash, Hatch remains defiant, insisting that Trump has been a ""great leader"" who has ""delivered on his promises."" In a statement, Hatch's office said, ""Senator Hatch has always been a strong supporter of the President and his policies. He believes that Trump has been one of the best presidents in recent history and will continue to stand by his side.""
The controversy surrounding Hatch's comments has once again highlighted the deep divisions within the Republican Party and the challenges it faces in the coming election. As the party struggles to find its footing, one thing is clear: the Trump presidency remains a highly polarizing issue that will continue to shape the political landscape for years to come."

Archaeologists associated with Niagara University of and master divers from the U.S Coast Guard were mobilized on site to determine what it was, and they soon realized that they were dealing with a German submarine that sank during World War II.A wreck recovery vessel of the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society was mandated to refloat the ship and bring it back to Niagara Falls, where it must be restored before becoming a museum ship. The delicate recovery operation took nearly 30 hours to complete, but the submarine was finally brought down on the bank with relative ease.The divers of the U.S. Coast guard braved the frigid water temperature to go attach cables to the wreck for the recovery operation.The submarine was identified as the UX-791, a unique experimental German submarine, based on the U-1200 model, and known to have participated in the “Battle of the St. Lawrence”. It was reported missing in 1943 and was believed to have been sunk near the Canadian coastProfessor Mark Carpenter, who leads the team of archaeologists, believes that the U-boat could have traveled up the St-Lawrence River, all the way to the Great Lakes, where it intended to disturb the American economy.A report from the dated from February 1943 suggests, that the ship could have attacked and destroyed three cargo ships and two fishing vessels, even damaging the USS Sable (IX-81), an aircraft carrier of the U.S. navy that was used for training in the Great Lakes, before finally being sunk by anti-sub grenades launched by a Canadian frigate.“We have known for a long time that the Nazis had sent some of their U-boats in the St-Lawrence River, but this is the first proof that they actually reached the Great Lakes,” Professor Carpenter told reporters. “This could explain the mysterious ship disappearances that took place in the region in 1943, and the reported “Battle of Niagara Falls” which had always been dismissed as a collective hallucination caused by fear.”The restoration of the submarine could take more than two years, but once completed, the museum ship is expected to become one of the major tourist attractions of the region.","by Jake 2 years ago
A team of divers from the U.S Coast Guard has successfully recovered a Nazi submarine that was discovered at the bottom of Lake Ontario two weeks ago. The operation, which began early this morning, was carried out with utmost care and precision to avoid any damage to the historical vessel. According to sources, the submarine, identified as U-857, was found in approximately 120 feet of water, approximately 30 miles northwest of Niagara Falls.
The team of divers, led by Lt. Commander James Johnson, worked tirelessly to carefully lift the submarine from the lake bed and transport it to a nearby barge for further examination. The submarine, which is believed to have sunk during a battle with Allied forces in 1944, is in remarkably good condition, considering its age and the conditions in which it was discovered.
""This is a significant find for both the U.S. and Canada,"" said Lt. Commander Johnson. ""The submarine provides a unique glimpse into the history of World War II and the bravery of those who fought on both sides of the conflict.""
The recovery operation was closely monitored by officials from both the U.S. and Canadian governments, as well as local authorities. The submarine is expected to undergo further examination and restoration before being put on display as a historical artifact.
The discovery of the Nazi submarine is a significant find, not only for its historical value, but also for the potential clues it may hold about the fate of other lost vessels from the war. The U.S. Coast Guard and Canadian authorities are expected to continue their search for other historical artifacts in the area."

In a shocking statement made during a recent interview, VideoAmerican broadcaster and actress Oprah Winfrey has claimed that there is a generation of racist individuals who are ""born and bred and marinated"" in racism and will never change their ways. According to Winfrey, these individuals are a product of their upbringing and environment, and their racist beliefs are deeply ingrained in their psyche.
Winfrey's comments have sparked widespread debate and outrage, with many people condemning her for painting an entire generation with a broad brush. However, experts in the field of psychology and sociology have expressed support for Winfrey's views, arguing that racism is a complex and deeply ingrained issue that cannot be easily changed.
""Racism is not just a matter of individual prejudice, it is a systemic problem that is deeply ingrained in our society,"" said Dr. Jane Smith, a leading expert in the field of sociology. ""It is not something that can be changed overnight, but rather through a sustained effort to address the underlying issues.""
Winfrey's comments have also sparked a renewed call for action to address the issue of racism, with many people calling for greater education and awareness-raising initiatives to combat the problem.
""We need to take a long hard look at ourselves and the society we have created,"" said Winfrey in a statement. ""We need to confront the racism that exists in our communities and work towards a more inclusive and equitable society for all.""
The issue of racism has been a persistent problem in the United States for decades, with many people arguing that it is a major obstacle to progress and equality. While some have expressed frustration with Winfrey's comments, others have welcomed her willingness to tackle the issue head-on and spark a much-needed conversation about the problem."

Can you write a news article based on this sentence?
Yes, I can certainly write a news article based on that sentence! Here is my attempt:
Washington D.C. - In a move that has sparked outrage and concern among Americans, President Donald Trump and the Republican-led Congress are set to cut crucial heating assistance programs for the elderly and disabled, as winter weather begins to sweep across the country. The cuts, which are expected to impact millions of vulnerable individuals, are being framed as a necessary step to reduce the national deficit and protect the economy. However, critics are accusing the Trump administration of using the poor and elderly as political pawns in their ongoing power struggle with the Democrats.
According to sources within the federal government, the heating assistance program, which provides critical support to those most in need during the harsh winter months, is facing a staggering 75% cut. The program, which has been in place for decades, has helped millions of Americans stay warm and safe during the coldest times of the year. However, with the Trump administration's latest budget proposal, those protections are set to be severely curtailed.
""This is a heartless and cruel move by the Trump administration,"" said Representative Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), the top Democrat in the House of Representatives. ""The elderly and disabled are some of the most vulnerable members of our society, and they deserve our protection and support, not political pawns. These cuts will have devastating consequences for millions of Americans, and they are a direct attack on the values of compassion and empathy that our country was founded upon.""
The cuts to the heating assistance program are part of a larger budget proposal put forth by the Trump administration, which aims to reduce the national deficit by $1.5 trillion over the next decade. While the proposal includes some spending increases in areas such as defense and infrastructure, it also makes deep cuts to many social welfare programs, including the heating assistance program.
Critics of the proposal argue that the cuts are not only unjust, but also economically misguided. They point out that the heating assistance program not only helps to keep millions of Americans safe and warm during the winter months, but also provides a vital safety net for those who are struggling to make ends meet. By cutting this program, they argue, the Trump administration is only exacerbating poverty and inequality, which can have long-term negative consequences for the economy as a whole.
As winter weather begins to set in across the country, the need for heating assistance is likely to increase, and the impact of these cuts will be felt most acutely by those who are already struggling to make ends meet. For many Americans, the loss of this critical support will mean the difference between life and death, and it is a stark reminder of the harsh consequences of political gamesmanship.
In response to the outcry over the cuts, the Trump administration has insisted that they are necessary to protect the economy and reduce the national deficit. However, critics argue that the administration's actions are motivated by a desire to score political points, rather than a genuine concern for the welfare of the American people.
As the debate over the budget proposal continues, one thing is clear: the impact of these cuts on the most vulnerable members of society will be severe and far-reaching. It is a stark reminder of the importance of compassion and empathy in public policy, and a call to action for those who believe in a more just and equitable society."

He also released a lengthy statement defending the Affordable Care Act against Trump’s attempts to repeal it.At a speech in Boston on Sunday night, Obama avoided mentioning Trump by name, but again forcefully defended his signature health care legislation and mentioned immigration reform. “I expect to be busy, if not with a second career, at least a second act,” Obama said Sunday.And on Monday, Obama’s aides aggressively pushed back against Trump for trying to blame his predecessor for the woes associated with Trump’s disgraced former national security adviser Michael Flynn. While Trump and White House press secretary Sean Spicer have repeatedly denounced Obama for not revoking Flynn’s security clearance, Obama aides told reporters that Obama tried to warn Trump about Flynn’s erratic nature.George W. Bush, meanwhile, has lobbed thinly veiled critiques of Trump on his approach to the press and the travel ban from some Muslim-majority countries. “I consider the media to be indispensable to democracy,” Bush said in an interview with “Today” in February. “We need an independent media to hold people like me to account.”As for the travel ban, Bush was restrained but clear in his concern. “I am for an immigration policy that's welcoming and upholds the law,” Bush said.Carter also voiced concerns after Trump’s inauguration. During an early April appearance at Emory University, he said he wanted to avoid addressing politics but he hoped the women’s movement would be “invigorated” by Trump and that he didn’t see “any glimmer of hope” from the administration on race and gender issues.Bill Clinton, who was harshly critical of Trump during the Manhattan businessman’s presidential campaign, didn’t mince words about Trump when he ran into a local newspaper editor while holiday shopping. “He doesn’t know much,” Clinton said in late December. “One thing he does know is how to get angry white men to vote for him.”George H.W. Bush, who has been in and out of the hospital, remains the only living president to avoid any political commentary.Criticism of the current president by former presidents is not completely unprecedented, however. For example, Herbert Hoover criticized Franklin D. Roosevelt, his successor.“We’ve seen some criticism already of th","Here's my attempt at a news piece:
Former President George W. Bush has taken a swipe at his successor, President Donald Trump, over his handling of the media and the controversial travel ban targeting several Muslim-majority countries. In a thinly-veiled critique, Bush argued that the current administration's approach to the press is undermining the very fabric of democracy, during a speech at the University of Chicago's Institute of Politics.
According to sources close to the former President, Bush believes that Trump's repeated attacks on the media are not only harmful to the Fourth Estate, but also erode trust in institutions that are essential to a functioning democracy. Bush reportedly expressed similar concerns about the travel ban, which he believes is not only unjust but also counterproductive in the fight against terrorism.
""We must always be mindful of the importance of a free press in a democracy,"" Bush said in his speech. ""It is the guardian of truth and the watchdog of the public trust. When the press is under attack, as it is today, we must stand up and defend it with all our might.""
Bush's comments come at a time when Trump's administration is facing increasing scrutiny over its handling of the media and its response to the travel ban. Critics argue that the ban, which targets several predominantly Muslim countries, is discriminatory and violates the Constitution.
The White House has defended the ban, arguing that it is necessary to protect national security and prevent terrorism. However, Bush and other critics argue that the ban is not only unconstitutional but also plays into the hands of extremist groups who seek to divide the world along religious and cultural lines.
In his speech, Bush also called on Americans to stand up for the principles of democracy and to defend the institutions that are essential to its functioning. ""We must always remember that democracy is not a destination but a journey,"" he said. ""It requires constant vigilance and a commitment to the principles that have made our country great.""
Bush's comments are likely to generate significant attention and debate, particularly among those who view him as a moderate voice in the Republican Party. His criticism of Trump's approach to the media and the travel ban is likely to be seen as a challenge to the current administration's policies and a call to action for those who believe in the importance of democratic values."

Washington D.C. - In a move that has sparked widespread concern among religious minorities, President Trump has announced plans to issue an executive order aimed at 'protecting' Christmas. The order, which is set to be signed on December 25th, will reportedly give federal agencies the authority to withhold funding from any organization that does not explicitly recognize the holiday as a 'Christian' holiday.
According to sources close to the White House, the order is intended to 'defend Christmas' from what the President has described as a 'war on the holiday' waged by 'liberal elites' and 'non-believers'. The move has been met with fierce criticism from civil rights groups, who argue that the order will violate the religious freedom of non-Christians and further marginalize already vulnerable communities.
In response to the backlash, the White House has maintained that the order is necessary to ensure that Christmas remains a 'holiday of faith' and not a 'holiday of secularism'. However, critics argue that the order will have the opposite effect, leading to a 'Christianization' of the holiday season and a further erosion of religious pluralism in the United States.
As the holiday season approaches, the controversy surrounding President Trump's Christmas order has raised concerns about the future of religious freedom in America. While some see the order as a necessary defense of a cherished holiday, others view it as a dangerous attack on the very principles of inclusivity and diversity that have long defined the American way of life."

WASHINGTON D.C. - In a surprising turn of events, the daughter of legendary civil rights activist Rosa Parks has come forward to defend President Trump against allegations of racism. In an exclusive interview with CNN, 76-year-oldRuby Parks-Johnson voiced her strong support for the President, stating that she believes he is not a racist and that the accusations against him are simply unfair.
""My mother fought tirelessly for equality and justice, and I cannot in good conscience believe that President Trump is a racist,"" said Parks-Johnson. ""He may have his own way of speaking and doing things, but that doesn't make him a bad person. I think he's doing a great job as President and I'm glad he's in office.""
Parks-Johnson's comments come as a surprise to many, given the long history of liberal activism within her family. Her mother, Rosa Parks, was a pioneering figure in the Civil Rights Movement and was known for her refusal to give up her seat on a Montgomery, Alabama bus to a white person in 1955, sparking the Montgomery Bus Boycott. However, Parks-Johnson insists that her mother would be proud of her support for Trump.

Parks-Johnson's endorsement of Trump is likely to generate significant attention and debate within the political sphere, particularly among liberals who have long accused the President of racism and xenophobia.

Michigan DNR Marine Biologist Dr. Debra Polowotski arrived at Good Harbor Bay and confirmed the 21 foot-long giant squid to be a very rare fresh-water species of genus Architeuthis. “We thought they were already in Lake Erie, we had no idea they were in Lake Michigan. This is first time there’s been an actual specimen recovered, so this is very exciting”, she said. It is believed that a few of the squid escaped from the Cleveland Sea World complex during the great Northeast blackout of 2003 when they were very young, and somehow made it into Lake Erie. According to Dr. Polowotski, the squid were kept contained in Lake Erie, as the Detroit River is too narrow and shallow for the squid to swim upstream. “They are intimidated by closed-in spaces. They need a lot of room. You have to remember that this is a very big animal”, she said. Dr. Polotwotski also confirmed that the squid is a female and further examination of the corpse indicated that it had recently laid eggs. “Hopefully the walleye can keep the tiny-giant squid population under control, else there is some cause for concern”, said Dr. Polowotski. “Boaters and swimmers really need to exercise some caution”.

But something like this really does make you stop and think”, he said.

Orlando, Fl. – In a historic move, Florida lawmakers have passed a bill that legalizes the use of marijuana for recreational purposes. This move comes as a victory for marijuana advocates who have been pushing for legalization for years. The bill, which was signed into law by Governor Ron DeSantis yesterday, will go into effect on January 1st, 2023.
Under the new law, adults 21 and older will be allowed to possess and use marijuana for recreational purposes. The law also establishes a system for the regulation and taxation of marijuana sales. According to the bill, the state will issue licenses to dispensaries and retailers, and a portion of the tax revenue will be used for drug treatment and education programs.
""This is a major step forward for the state of Florida,"" said Governor DeSantis in a statement. ""We recognize the potential benefits of marijuana and believe that legalization will help to reduce crime and increase public safety.""
The passage of the bill has been met with enthusiasm from marijuana advocates, who have long argued that the drug is safer than other substances and should be legalized. ""This is a huge victory for the marijuana community,"" said John Doe, a spokesperson for the Florida Cannabis Association. ""We are thrilled that the state of Florida is finally recognizing the benefits of marijuana and taking steps to legalize it.""
However, not everyone is celebrating the news. Some lawmakers and law enforcement officials have expressed concerns about the potential negative impacts of legalization, including increased drug use and abuse. ""While we understand the desire to legalize marijuana, we must be careful to ensure that it is done in a responsible and safe manner,"" said Senator Jane Smith in a statement.
Despite these concerns, the passage of the bill marks a significant shift in the state's stance on marijuana and is expected to have a major impact on the state's economy. According to a recent study, the legalization of marijuana in Florida could generate up to $1 billion in tax revenue each year.
As the new year approaches, marijuana smokers in Florida are eagerly awaiting the start of the new law. For many, it will mean the ability to legally use a drug that they have been using for years, without fear of criminal charges.
In conclusion, the passage of the bill to legalize marijuana in Florida is a significant step forward for the state and the country as a whole. While there are still concerns about the potential negative impacts of legalization, the benefits of the drug are undeniable, and it is clear that the time for change has come. As the new year begins, Florida will join the growing list of US states that have legalized marijuana, and the consequences will be felt for years to come."

Some of the more pathetic and pandering individuals, however, have criticized the new law.The Guardian compares the law to Hitler:“There is little to smile about, however, when Zeman sets out what he sees as the threat being posed by radical Islamists – and even “moderate” Muslims, who he says could be radicalised to commit terror attacks as ordinary Germans were once inspired to fanatically back Hitler.”Yes, that’s right—because apparently Leftists think that protecting your nation from a cult of death, that rapes women, stones gays, and beheads thieves, is somehow “intolerant.” Well do you know what most Americans think?You’re damn right it’s intolerant! Why the HELL should we be tolerant of a barbaric religion that wants to take us back to the 500’s AD? We shouldn’t! We value freedom and family, and we WILL NOT have our country overrun by Islam.Thankfully, despite the overwhelming Leftist propaganda claiming that the law is “unfair,” and “discriminates,” against Muslims, conservatives all across the world have had their morale boosted.Despite what liberals may say about gun safety issues, The Czech Republic is actually one of the safest nations out there—6th safest in the world, to be exact.“Although Western European countries such as France, Belgium, Germany and the UK have suffered several terrorist attacks in recent years, the Czech Republic has not seen any attacks. The Global Peace Index 2016 ranked the country the sixth safest in the world.”After the past decade of liberal policies, pandering to immigrants, and welcoming terrorists into our country with open arms, many are proud to see that Europe is beginning to stand up for itself.

Washington D.C. - In a stunning turn of events, Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore is adamantly denying allegations that he romantically pursued teenagers as young as 14 while he was in his 30s. In a statement released earlier today, Moore categorically rejected the bombshell report, calling it a ""fabrication"" and a ""desperate attempt to discredit my campaign.""
Moore, a conservative Christian lawyer and former judge, has been under fire since the Washington Post published a report detailing accounts from multiple women who claimed that Moore pursued them romantically when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s. The allegations have sparked widespread outrage and calls for Moore to withdraw from the Senate race.
However, in his statement, Moore maintained that he has never engaged in any inappropriate behavior with minors and that the allegations against him are ""completely false."" Moore's campaign has also released a list of dozens of character witnesses who attest to his good reputation and moral integrity.
Despite Moore's denials, the allegations have already had a significant impact on his campaign, with several high-profile Republicans calling for him to step aside. The situation is likely to continue to dominate the headlines in the coming days, with many questioning whether Moore's candidacy can survive the damaging allegations.
In related news, the Alabama Republican Party is set to hold an emergency meeting on Wednesday to discuss the situation and potential next steps. It is expected that the party will release a statement on the matter in the near future."

In a statement released today, the Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC) has expressed deep concerns over the deteriorating humanitarian situation in the war-torn country. According to the statement, the organization has been unable to reach many areas affected by the ongoing conflict, leaving thousands of civilians without access to basic necessities such as food, water, and medical care.
""The situation on the ground is dire, and we have received numerous reports of civilians suffering from severe malnutrition, dehydration, and injuries,"" said a spokesperson for SARC. ""We are doing everything in our power to reach these areas and provide aid to those in need, but the conflict is making it increasingly difficult for us to do so.""
The statement comes as the United Nations has warned that the humanitarian crisis in Syria is reaching a ""catastrophic"" level, with over 5 million people displaced and more than 250,000 killed since the start of the conflict in 2011.
""The international community must take action to address this crisis and ensure that civilians are protected and provided with the aid they desperately need,"" said a spokesperson for the UN. ""We urge all parties involved in the conflict to allow humanitarian organizations to operate freely and to respect international humanitarian law.""
The SARC statement has raised concerns that the situation in Syria could worsen in the coming weeks, with winter approaching and the conflict showing no signs of abating.
""We are deeply concerned about the fate of civilians in Syria, and we will continue to do everything in our power to provide them with the aid they need to survive,"" said the SARC spokesperson. ""But we cannot do it alone. The international community must stand with us in this effort to alleviate the suffering of the Syrian people.""
The statement from SARC comes as the organization marks its 70th anniversary, highlighting its commitment to providing humanitarian aid to those in need, regardless of the conflict."

However as he was speaking to other physicians, he was not breaking the industry code of conduct.Gates has three children with his wife Melinda – Jennifer, Rory and Phoebe – born between 1996 and 2002, and according to his former doctor, they are all unvaccinated and healthy.The news that Bill Gates does not vaccinate his own children, despite being the world’s most active campaigner for mandatory vaccinations, should come as no surprise.

BREAKING: Shocking revelation about Bill Gates' vaccine stance
In a bombshell revelation, a former private physician of Bill Gates has come forward with a disturbing claim about the Microsoft founder's stance on vaccines. According to the physician, who treated Gates and his family in Seattle in the 1990s, Gates refused to vaccinate his own children when they were young.
This revelation has sparked widespread outrage and disbelief among health experts and vaccine advocates, who have long praised Gates for his tireless efforts to improve global vaccine access and distribution. Gates has been a vocal proponent of vaccines, donating billions of dollars to support vaccine research and development, and advocating for increased vaccination rates around the world.
However, the revelation that he refused to vaccinate his own children raises serious questions about Gates' commitment to vaccine safety and effectiveness. It also highlights the ongoing debate about vaccine hesitancy and the importance of addressing the concerns of parents who are hesitant to vaccinate their children.
According to the physician, who wishes to remain anonymous, Gates' decision not to vaccinate his children was based on concerns about the safety of vaccines. ""He was afraid that the vaccines would harm his children, and he didn't want to take any chances,"" the physician said in an interview with this reporter.
While Gates has not publicly commented on the physician's claims, his representatives have issued a statement denying the allegation. ""Bill Gates has always been a strong advocate for vaccine safety and effectiveness, and he has never refused to vaccinate his own children,"" the statement read.
Despite the denial, the revelation is likely to have significant implications for Gates' reputation and influence in the global health community. As one expert noted, ""If true, this would be a significant betrayal of trust, and it could undermine the credibility of Gates' advocacy efforts on vaccine issues.""
The story is still developing, and this reporter will provide updates as more information becomes available. In the meantime, vaccine advocates are urging caution and skepticism, and are calling for more transparency and accountability from Gates and other public figures who promote vaccine safety and effectiveness."

According to sources close to the situation, Streep made derogatory comments about the President of the United States during a speech at the Golden Globes, without ever mentioning his name. This move was seen as a clear attack on Trump, who was in attendance at the event.
Ron Howard, the director of the project, confirmed that Streep was no longer being considered for the role of an older, wiser version of Mrs. C in a reboot of Happy Days. ""Meryl's actions were unacceptable and we cannot have her represent our brand,"" Howard said in a statement.

As one of Hollywood's most respected and beloved actresses, Streep's fall from grace is sure to be felt throughout the industry."

In a bold move to crack down on intellectual property infringement, the Copyright Act of 2018 has proposed a new law that would require online content providers to automatically monitor their platforms for copyrighted material. According to the law, all websites and social media platforms would be required to use automated software to detect and remove any infringing content, without the need for manual intervention.
The proposed law, titled the ""Online Content Monitoring Act,"" aims to address the growing problem of copyright infringement on the internet. With the rise of streaming services and social media platforms, the number of copyright infringements has increased significantly, with many creators and publishers losing millions of dollars in revenue due to unauthorized use of their work.
""This law is a game-changer for creators and publishers,"" said Sarah Johnson, spokesperson for the Copyright Alliance. ""For too long, they have been left vulnerable to theft and exploitation by online pirates. With this new law, we can finally hold these criminals accountable and protect the intellectual property that drives our economy.""
The proposed law would require all online content providers to implement a system of automated monitoring, which would be overseen by a new government agency, the ""Office of Online Content Monitoring."" The agency would be responsible for monitoring compliance with the law and would have the power to fine or even shut down any platform that fails to meet the requirements.
While some have expressed concerns about the potential for abuse of power under the new law, proponents argue that it is a necessary measure to protect the intellectual property of creators and publishers. ""This law is not just about protecting the rights of creators, it's about protecting the integrity of the internet itself,"" said Johnson. ""Without strong enforcement of intellectual property rights, the internet will become a Wild West of piracy and exploitation, where no one is safe.""
The proposed law is expected to be signed into law by the end of the year, and will take effect in 2019."

Either rising sea temperatures and depleted fish stocks possibly led the shark to adventure itself further into the Great Lakes region.” he admits, visibly puzzled. “It is also possible it traveled to the region through underwater tunnels that interconnect between the Great Lakes,” he told reporters.According to authorities more than a hundred people reported missing in the area in the last decade may have fallen under the fangs of the gigantic beast, several local residents even suspecting its presence for a long time.U.S. Coast Guards reassured local residents that the occurrence of such a predator in the region’s waters “is highly unlikely” as sharks are not well adapted to freshwater systems.In 1916, a deadly shark attack near Presque Ile beach, in Lake Eerie, made national headlines, forcing local authorities to ban swimming in the region for over 14 years until the ban was lifted in 1930.","According to witnesses, the shark was seen attacking and devouring a small boat in the early hours of the morning, before it was caught by fishermen. The Coast Guard has launched an investigation into the matter and urged citizens to be cautious while enjoying the water in the area. ""This is a rare and unusual incident, but we are grateful that no one was seriously injured,"" said Commander Michael Smith of the U.S. Coast Guard. ""We will do everything in our power to ensure the safety of the public and to determine the cause of this unusual event."" In related news, local authorities have advised residents to stay away from the water until further notice. The shark is currently being held at the U.S. Coast Guard station in Waukegan, where experts are studying it."

Waters swiped at Loomer’s camera and swatted Loomer with her office papers.Watch:After the incident, Loomer vowed to hold the left accountable for their hypocritical actions.","Laura Loomer, a well-known conservative investigative journalist, has filed a police report charging Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-CA) with assault. According to Loomer, Waters hit her hand and swatted her face with office papers during a heated confrontation at a political event earlier this week.
In a statement provided to reporters, Loomer claimed that Waters ""physically assaulted"" her, causing her to suffer a ""severely bruised hand"" and ""emotional distress."" Loomer alleges that the altercation began when she confronted Waters about the congresswoman's controversial statements about President Donald Trump and his administration.
""I was simply trying to ask Waters some questions about her comments when she suddenly attacked me,"" Loomer said. ""I'm grateful that I was able to defend myself, but I'm deeply concerned about the safety of other journalists who may be targeted by politicians like Waters.""
The incident has sparked outrage among conservatives, who see it as yet another example of the dangers faced by journalists who dare to challenge the political establishment. Loomer's supporters have taken to social media to demand justice for the ""brave journalist,"" with many calling for Waters to be held accountable for her actions.
Waters, who has been a vocal critic of Trump and his administration, has yet to comment on the incident. However, a spokesperson for the congresswoman told reporters that Waters ""vehemently denies"" any wrongdoing and is ""cooperating fully with the authorities.""
The incident has reignited calls for greater protection for journalists, who are increasingly facing violence and intimidation while trying to do their jobs. ""This is a clear example of the dangers faced by journalists who are simply trying to do their jobs,"" said Sarah Jones, a spokesperson for the National Press Club. ""We urge authorities to take this incident seriously and to ensure that journalists are protected from violence and intimidation.""
For Loomer, the incident has left her shaken but undeterred. ""I will not be silenced by politicians like Waters,"" she said. ""I will continue to fight for the truth and to hold those in power accountable, no matter the cost."""
politifact14155,1,1,"HERE Is WHAT WILL HAPPEN If The DEEP STATE TAKES DOWN PRESIDENT TRUMP & It’s NOT PRETTY … FOR THEM“The tree of liberty must be refreshed with the blood of patriots and tyrants.” – Thomas JeffersonELDER PATRIOT – Corrupt politicians ignore Jefferson’s directive to their own detriment. It’s no longer political, it’s personal.Americans have had their eyes opened by the ascension of Donald Trump and no amount of leftwing money can put the Freedom Movement genie back in the bottle.Conservative Senator Ted Cruz made that observation after reviewing the results of the 2016 elections and the expectations of the voters.Cruz, who had the most high profile personality clash with Donald Trump during the Republican primary process nevertheless embraced Trump’s America First agenda and said, “If we’re given the White House and both houses of Congress and we don’t deliver, I think there will be pitchforks and torches in the streets. And I think quite rightly.”Candidate Trump promised many things – border control, lower taxes, fairer trade relations, a balanced budget, healthcare that puts the people first not the government, safer communities, and – to the extent possible – an end to foreign wars. What, among those promises, should any Republican, nay any American, have a problem with?After four months without a single legislative achievement, Congressional and Senatorial Republicans – notably John McCain, Paul Ryan and Lindsey Graham – have joined the Democrats in investigating President Trump absent a single shred of evidence that an underlying crime has been committed.So, what gives?Well, there was one additional promise that Trump made on his way to the White House that has some Republicans joining with Democrats and quaking in their boots, Trump’s promise to “Drain the Swamp.”As we reported yesterday, “An F.B.I. agent with ‘intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the Clinton case’ told us that they uncovered evidence of such massive corruption that the agents involved realized that damned near the entire government could be brought down.”The criminal co-conspirators in both parties realized almost immediately that the new sheriff wasn’t interested in joining them in the swamp so they launched, what can only be characterized as, a coup attempt.Democrats are well schooled in such things probably because of their close alliance with Marxist regimes that can only gain power by seizing it through bloody civil wars. It should be noted that the Democratic Party has already done this once before.One Hundred and Fifty-Seven years ago the Democrats waged a war against the First Republican President Abraham Lincoln for giving Blacks their freedom. That war came at a high price, as many as 700,000 Americans died fighting for what they believe in. To put that in perspective, these casualties exceed the nation’s loss in all its other wars, from the Revolution through Vietnam.Today, Americans are still prepared to fight and die to protect their children’s God-given freedoms. Despite what you are reading and hearing in the mainstream media, they aren’t the leftwing-funded rioters, the pussy hat-wearing feminists, or the cuck bois that cant handle a micro aggression. No, the Americans that back Donald Trump are well armed.Donald Trump’s presidency will move forward politically lest the sixty million patriots who voted for him, that are comprised of the large majority of military voters, police, and NRA members, move it forward by force.These patriots are armed, trained, prepared, and have proven their discipline. They have grown disgusted by the corruption in Washington and will do whatever is necessary to make sure Trump’s Freedom Agenda moves forward and under the direction of Donald Trump himself.No amount of fake news based on unsubstantiated charges by unnamed sources is going to change that. The battle lines have been drawn and no amount of finger pointing is going to convince these patriots to let anyone overturn the election results.So why a","- Thomas JeffersonThe deep state has been making a lot of noise lately, and it seems they are getting ready to take down President Trump.

politifact13973,1,0,"In Tbilisi, the two-room rented apartment Mr. Latsabidze shares with his younger brother is an unlikely offshore outpost of America’s fake news industry. The two brothers, both computer experts, get help from a third young Georgian, an architect.They say they have no keen interest in politics themselves and initially placed bets across the American political spectrum and experimented with show business news, too. They set up a pro-Clinton website, walkwithher.com, a Facebook page cheering Bernie Sanders and a web digest of straightforward political news plagiarized from The New York Times and other mainstream news media.But those sites, among the more than a dozen registered by Mr. Latsabidze, were busts. Then he shifted all his energy to Mr. Trump. His flagship pro-Trump website, departed.co, gained remarkable traction in a crowded field in the prelude to the Nov. 8 election thanks to steady menu of relentlessly pro-Trump and anti-Clinton stories. (On Wednesday, a few hours after The New York Times met with Mr. Latsabidze to ask him about his activities, the site vanished along with his Facebook page.)“My audience likes Trump,” he said. “I don’t want to write bad things about Trump. If I write fake stories about Trump, I lose my audience.”Some of his Trump stories are true, some are highly slanted and others are totally false, like one this summer reporting that “the Mexican government announced they will close their borders to Americans in the event that Donald Trump is elected President of the United States.” Data compiled by Buzzfeed showed that the story was the third most-trafficked fake story on Facebook from May to July.So successful was the formula that others in Georgia and other faraway lands joined in, too, including Nika Kurdadze, a college acquaintance of Mr. Latsabidze’s who set up his own pro-Trump site, newsbreakshere.com. Its recent offerings included a fake report headlined: “Stop it Liberals…Hillary Lost the Popular Vote by Several Million. Here’s Why.” That story, like most of Mr. Latsabidze’s work, was pilfered from the web.Mr. Latsabidze initially ran into no problems from all his cutting and pasting of other people’s stories, and he even got ripped off himself when a rival in India hijacked a pro-Trump Facebook page he had set up to drive traffic to his websites. (He said that the Indian rival had offered $10,000 to buy the page, but that he had reneged on payment after being provided with access rights and commandeered it for himself.)","Title: Tbilisi Apartment Uncovered as Hub of Fake News Operations
In a shocking revelation, an unlikely offshore outpost of America’s fake news industry has been uncovered in the heart of Tbilisi, Georgia. According to sources, a two-room rented apartment shared by Mr. Latsabidze and his younger brother is the hub of a sophisticated network of fake news operators, churning out fabricated stories and propaganda on a daily basis.
The discovery has raised serious concerns about the influence of foreign actors on Georgia’s political landscape, and the potential for similar operations to be taking place in other countries.
“This is a clear violation of Georgia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,” said a senior government official, speaking on condition of anonymity. “We will not stand idly by while foreign powers attempt to manipulate our democratic processes through fake news and disinformation.”
The Latsabidze brothers, both in their mid-30s, have been the subject of intense scrutiny in recent weeks, with many in Tbilisi speculating about the source of their wealth and the true nature of their activities.
“It’s shocking to think that such a small apartment in a quiet neighborhood could be at the center of such a massive conspiracy,” said one neighbor, who wished to remain anonymous. “But at the same time, it makes sense. Tbilisi is a city with a rich history of political intrigue and corruption. Anything is possible here.”
The discovery of the fake news operation in Tbilisi comes at a time of increasing tensions between Georgia and Russia, with both countries accusing each other of meddling in each other’s internal affairs.
“This is not just a threat to Georgia’s democracy, but to the stability of the entire region,” said a senior diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. “We must take immediate action to prevent the spread of fake news and disinformation, and to protect the integrity of our democratic institutions.”
In response to the discovery, Georgia’s government has announced plans to launch a full-scale investigation into the fake news operation in Tbilisi, with the goal of bringing those responsible to justice and preventing similar operations from taking place in the future.
The investigation is expected to be a complex and challenging one, as the operators of the fake news operation have been known to use advanced techniques and technologies to obscure their tracks and evade detection.
But with the spotlight now shone on their activities, the future of the fake news industry in Tbilisi is uncertain. Will the operators be able to continue their work in secret, or will they be brought to justice and exposed for the world to see? Only time will tell."
politifact14893,1,0,"President Donald Trump has only been in office for a short time and he’s already caused so much anxiety to the country, including the intelligence community. Instead of continuing to be a punching bag though, one intelligence agency decided to fight back and they just sent Trump a message: they are watching him. In a twist right out of a Hollywood film, six White House staffers were escorted out of the White House for failing their background investigations. Here’s what WJ just reported:“The staffers were escorted from the White house Wednesday for problems with their SF86 application, the ‘Questionnaire for National Security Positions.’ The 127-page document includes questions on the applicant’s credit score, medical records, employment history, family history, substance use and other personal subjects.”The six staffers included the daughter of President Trump’s Florida campaign manager Caroline Wiles:“Wiles, who resigned Friday before the background check was completed, was appointed deputy assistant secretary before the inauguration in January. She will instead get a job at the Treasury Department, sources told Politico.”The form, called the SF86, is for anyone who is applying for a sensitive position in the U.S government. Depending on the level of clearance and the agency requesting it, information collected can go all the way back to the age of 18 and in some instances, a polygraph exam is required. Both the FBI and the CIA require polygraph exams for top secret positions.It’s striking that Trump had already employed individuals who had not yet passed background investigations. It shouldn’t be surprising then that intelligence agencies are refusing to share information with his administration:“Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, said in an interview with The Journal that the intelligence community considered protecting its sources and the people cultivating them to be ‘their most sacred obligation.’ Schiff added, referring to Trump: ‘I’m sure there are people in the community who feel they don’t know where he’s coming from on Russia.'”Just as was the case with Michael Flynn who just recently resigned over his shady ties to Russia, you can bet that this administration is being closely watched.Featured Photo by Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images","Title: Trump's Tenure Triggers Turmoil in Intelligence Community

Washington D.C. - In a stunning turn of events, President Donald Trump's brief tenure in office has already ignited a firestorm of controversy within the intelligence community, leaving many top officials feeling anxious and uncertain about the future.
Just a few weeks into his presidency, Trump has made several decisions that have raised eyebrows and sparked concerns among intelligence professionals. His sudden order to re-evaluate the nation's intelligence priorities, for instance, has left many wondering if the new administration is more interested in scoring political points than in protecting the country's security.
""It's like a breath of fresh air, to be honest,"" said a high-ranking official at the CIA, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""We've been stuck in a rut for years, and it's time for some change. But the way Trump is going about it, it's like he's more interested in his own agenda than in doing what's best for the country.""
Other intelligence officials have expressed similar sentiments, with some going so far as to say that Trump's actions are endangering the very fabric of the intelligence community. ""We're seeing a breakdown in trust and cooperation within the community, and it's all because of the President's unpredictable behavior,"" said a former NSA official.
The situation has become so dire, in fact, that some lawmakers are now calling for greater oversight of the intelligence community to prevent the President from further undermining its integrity. ""We need to make sure that the intelligence community is able to do its job without interference from the White House,"" said a senior Senator. ""The American people deserve nothing less than the best possible protection from threats both foreign and domestic.""
As the drama unfolds, one thing is clear: the intelligence community is in uncharted territory, and the fate of national security hangs in the balance."

Puerto Rico Relief Efforts Hampered by Logistical Challenges, Says Top Commander
San Juan, PR - As Hurricane Maria continues to wreak havoc across Puerto Rico, Colonel Michael A. Valle (”Torch”), Commander of the 101st Air and Space Operations Group and Director of the Joint Air Component Coordination Element, 1st Air Force, has expressed concern over the slow movement of relief supplies across the island. Despite having generators, water, food, medicine, and fuel on hand, the supplies are not reaching those in need as quickly as they should be.
”We have the resources, but the challenges in getting them to where they're needed are significant,” Colonel Valle said in a statement. “We're doing everything we can to get these critical supplies to the people who need them most, but it's not happening as quickly as we would like.”
Colonel Valle's comments come as the death toll from the hurricane continues to rise, with over 30 confirmed deaths so far and thousands more feared missing. The storm has also caused widespread destruction, with entire communities reduced to rubble and millions of people left without access to basic necessities.
The US military has been working around the clock to provide relief to those affected by the hurricane, with Colonel Valle's unit leading the charge in the relief efforts. However, the slow movement of supplies has made it difficult for them to reach those in need in a timely manner.
”We understand the urgency of this situation, and we're doing everything we can to get these supplies to the people who need them,” Colonel Valle said. “But it's not easy, and we need the support of the public to help us get these supplies to where they're needed as quickly as possible.”
The situation on the ground in Puerto Rico is dire, with many communities cut off from basic necessities and struggling to survive. The lack of progress in getting supplies to those in need has raised concerns about the long-term impact of the hurricane on the island's population.
As the relief efforts continue, Colonel Valle and his team remain committed to doing everything they can to help those affected by the hurricane. But the challenges they face are significant, and it will take time and effort to get the supplies to where they're needed most."

Attorney General Jeff Sessions today issued a statement regarding his recusal from any investigation or decision-making related to the Russia investigation. In a move that is seen as a precautionary measure to ensure the integrity of the investigation, Sessions announced that he would be recusing himself from any matters related to the Russia probe, following a meeting with Department of Justice ethics officials. ""I take my responsibility to uphold the law and protect the integrity of this department very seriously,"" Sessions said in a statement. ""I have consulted with ethics officials and I am fully committed to recusing myself from any matter where my impartiality may reasonably be questioned."" This decision comes after Sessions faced criticism for his role in the Trump campaign and his involvement in the transition team. Democrats have called for his recusal, citing potential conflicts of interest. ""This is a necessary step to ensure that the investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election is conducted fairly and impartially,"" said Senator Mark Warner, Vice Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. ""We appreciate Attorney General Sessions' willingness to take this step and we will continue to monitor the situation closely."" Sessions' recusal will have significant implications for the investigation, as he was involved in the Trump campaign and transition team. It is unclear at this time how this will impact the investigation, but it is clear that the Department of Justice is taking steps to ensure the integrity of the investigation."

politifact15109,1,0,"Michelle Obama has been mostly laying low on one vacation after another since leaving the White House, only to emerge when she sees an opportunity to publicly slam President Donald Trump. A lot of questions have come up about the former first lady, starting when Barack Obama was still the president and continuing on now as the two live very separate lives. Although she’s desperately tried to hide the truth for months, a doctor has recently revealed what she has diagnosed her with which confirms our suspicions as well as our fears.Many have felt that Michelle’s behavior in the final months of being the first lady was strange, even for her, and has only gotten more alarming since the arrogant woman left the White House, but perpetually tries to remain as the center of everyone’s attention. Much of the country is happy to have her and her husband out of politics and wish that she’d slip into obscurity, but she refuses. Now we know why.Michelle’s hate for America seemed to become more obvious as the grip of power she had while her husband was president started to slip away at the end of his second term as their eviction dated neared. Every chance she got to make disparaging remarks about the country, she took, which has been a habit that’s only gotten worse in her post-presidential life. Dr. Lauren A. Wright, PhD, who is director of investor relations at NV5 Global, Inc. and a member of the White House Transition Project, shed some light on why Michelle did this as result of what she unofficially diagnosed her with.Biz Pac Review reported on the issue at the end of Obama’s administration before Trump took office:Why is First Lady Michelle Obama suddenly appearing so many places disparaging the country in the last days of her husband’s presidency?Dr. Lauren A. Wright, PhD, who is director of investor relations at NV5 Global, Inc. and a member of the White House Transition Project, recently wrote a book entitled, “On Behalf of the President: Presidential Spouses and White House Communications Strategy Today.”Wright diagnosed Mrs. Obama’s recent behavior. She has become an attack dog in an effort to help Obama build his legacy as the last days of his presidency slip away.“She’s in legacy building mode. She doesn’t have to worry about the implications [of her remarks] for months to come,” Wright said. “This is the time she’s most free to say what she feels, what she believes, and what she wants the message to be for the public.”As First Lady, Obama has given more public speeches and indulged more appearances than any First Lady in history, Wright reported in her book.“I think what surprises and upsets people most often is that first ladies give more public remarks than vice presidents, and that’s been true over the last three administrations,” she wrote.Of her biggest, and most disturbing claims she made in her campaign of hate against the country was that America is a racist nation who needed her husband in office and that she’s now suffering a feeling of “hopelessness” with Trump in office. Doubling down on that disrespectful sentiment is that she said she was never proud of America until her husband got elected to the White House. It’s ironic how Michelle says Barrack was successful in inspiring hope in the nation after everyone overwhelmingly voted Trump in, desperate for the hope his predecessor promised and failed to deliver on.The best case of revenge was how miserably she failed at building her legacy and trying to save it in the final days, especially now, that Trump just took the final sledgehammer to her most beloved project. After her disastrous lunch program crumbled around her and even her biggest supporters were critical of the changes she made to school meals, her nemesis, Trump, came in and reversed all she had done. He then topped it off by giving kids back their chocolate milk that she had ridiculously robbed them of.Dean James from America’s Freedom Fighters let loose on Michelle and her nasty claims about our coun","Here is a news article based on the sentence provided:
WASHINGTON D.C. - Michelle Obama, the former First Lady of the United States, has been enjoying a quiet retirement since leaving the White House in 2017. However, sources close to Mrs. Obama have revealed that she has been laying low on one vacation after another, only emerging when she sees an opportunity to publicly criticize President Donald Trump.
According to insiders, Mrs. Obama has been actively monitoring current events and has been particularly vocal in her opposition to Trump's policies, particularly those that affect women's rights and minority communities. While she has refrained from making any public statements during her post-White House hiatus, it is clear that she has been steadily building a case against the President, waiting for the right moment to strike.
Mrs. Obama's latest salvo came last week, when she delivered a scathing speech at a women's rights conference, denouncing Trump's efforts to roll back gender equality gains. ""As a former First Lady, I have a responsibility to speak out against injustice, especially when it affects the most vulnerable among us,"" she said. ""President Trump's policies are a threat to the very fabric of our society, and I will not stand idly by while he dismantles the progress we have made.""
The speech was seen as a clear indication that Mrs. Obama is ready to take on the Trump administration, and her supporters are eagerly awaiting her next move. While some have criticized her for being too outspoken, many see her as a beacon of hope in a time of political turmoil. As one observer noted, ""Michelle Obama has always been a voice of reason and compassion, and it's heartening to see her standing up for what's right, even in the face of opposition.""
In the meantime, Mrs. Obama continues to lay low, biding her time until she can strike again. As she herself once said, ""When you're going through hell, keep going."" And that is exactly what she is doing, as she continues to fight for justice and equality in the face of adversity."

As Antifa took to the streets over the weekend, one very strong voice in civil rights spoke up to denounce their claims that Donald Trump's presidency is a threat to marginalized communities. The voice, that of Rev. Al Sharpton, a prominent civil rights activist and leader of the National Action Network, issued a scathing statement rejecting Antifa's tactics and accusing them of undermining the very causes they purport to defend. ""Antifa's actions are not the answer,"" Sharpton said. ""They are only serving to further polarize an already divided society and distract from the real issues that need to be addressed."" Sharpton went on to say that the fight for civil rights and social justice must be carried out through peaceful and constructive means, and that the use of violence and intimidation only serves to undermine the legitimacy of the movement. ""We must stand up against injustice and oppression, but we must do so in a way that respects the rights and dignity of all people, including those who may hold different views,"" he concluded."

politifact14756,1,0,"Updated | A new book by Donna Brazile, the former interim chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), has been making headlines for its controversial claims about the 2016 presidential election and the Hillary Clinton campaign. But the provocative points start even before the first chapter, as Brazile reportedly dedicated the book in part to Seth Rich, the DNC staffer whose murder launched a conspiracy theory.Axios reported on Sunday that the book's dedication reads, “In loving memory of my father, Lionel Brazile Sr.; my beloved sister, Sheila Brazile; my fearless uncles Nat, Floyd, and Douglas; Harlem’s finest, my aunt Lucille; my friend and mentor, David Kaufmann; my DNC colleague and patriot, Seth Rich; and my beloved Pomeranian, Chip Joshua Marvin Brazile (Booty Wipes). I miss y’all.”Related: TV Ad With Russian Subtitles Questions Seth Rich’s MurderRich, 27, was fatally shot in July 2016 while walking home late at night in Washington, D.C. The police believe the shooting was a robbery gone wrong. But Rich worked for the DNC, and WikiLeaks published thousands of emails from the committee two weeks after his death. That timeline provoked theories that Rich had given the materials to WikiLeaks and that his death was an attempt to stop him from doing so, or to punish him for it.Media reports had characterized Rich as a low-level staffer, and his parents wrote in an opinion piece for The Washington Post in May, “Those who have suggested that Seth’s role as a data analyst at the DNC gave him access to a wide trove of emails are simply incorrect.”SAUL LOEB/AFP/GettyRich appears elsewhere in Brazile’s book, as the Post reported earlier in the weekend. She wrote that Rich’s murder haunted her and that she'd installed surveillance cameras at her home and would keep the blinds in her office window closed so she could not be seen by snipers, according to the Post.Keep up with this story and more by subscribing nowBrazile talked about Rich on ABC News’s This Week with George Stephanopoulos on Sunday. She told the host about her critics: “They don’t know what it was like to be over the DNC during this hacking. They don’t know what it’s like to bury a child. I did: Seth Rich.”Brazile had spoken publicly about Rich’s death before. In March, she said she was going to an Omaha, Nebraska, synagogue to speak about him. In May, she tweeted, “Seth Rich was a hard worker and proud to be an American. This desire to scar Seth’s legacy to his country and party is shameful.” About two months later, after Fox News published a since debunked story about the case, she tweeted, “Seth was a good soul and look at this shameful act.”Through spokesman Brad Bauman, the Rich family said in a statement, “Since Seth was murdered, Donna Brazile has been a great friend to the Rich family and has been extremely supportive of the family’s efforts to find Seth’s killers.”In the book, out Tuesday, Brazile also writes that she weighed the possibility of replacing Clinton as the Democratic presidential nominee with former Vice President Joe Biden, according to the Post. She also reportedly wrote that Clinton’s campaign headquarters seemed “antiseptic, like a hospital,” and that she felt as though the Clinton campaign was treating her like a “slave.” In an excerpt that Politico published on November 2, she wrote about how the Clinton campaign worked out a fundraising agreement with the DNC and exercised control over the party long before Clinton became the nominee.Former aides to the Clinton campaign have challenged Brazile’s claims. In a November 4 open letter, more than 100 former top aides wrote, “It is particularly troubling and puzzling that she would seemingly buy into false Russian-fueled propaganda, spread by both the Russians and our opponent, about our candidate’s health.”Brazile was not available for comment through her publisher, Hachette Book Group, or through Georgetown University, where she is a faculty member. The publisher was unavailable to ","A new book by Donna Brazile, the former interim chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), has been making headlines for its controversial claims about the 2016 presidential election and the Hillary Clinton campaign.
In the book, Brazile alleges that the DNC was ""rigged"" in favor of Clinton and that the party's leadership was undermined by a ""coup"" orchestrated by Clinton and her allies. Brazile also claims that she found evidence of ""mole"" within the DNC who was feeding information to the Clinton campaign.
The book's release has sparked outrage and denials from Clinton and her supporters, who have accused Brazile of peddling ""sour grapes"" and spreading ""false conspiracy theories."" However, Brazile's allegations have also been met with support from some quarters, with some Democrats expressing gratitude for her willingness to speak out against what they see as a corrupt and undemocratic party structure.
The controversy has also raised questions about the integrity of the 2016 election and the role of the DNC in the campaign. Some have called for a full investigation into the allegations made by Brazile, while others have dismissed them as politically motivated and unworthy of attention.
In any case, the release of Brazile's book has sent shockwaves through the political world and has reignited debates about the role of the DNC and the integrity of the electoral process."

politifact14384,1,0,"Photo: Pete Marovich/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesPeter Strzok, the FBI agent who sent anti-Trump messages to a colleague while leading the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s emails and Russia’s involvement in the Trump campaign, has said he’s willing to testify before the House Judiciary Committee, or any other committee that wants to talk with him. This could lead to dramatic hearings, as Strzok could expose more information about those probes, and is central to President Trump’s effort to discredit Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.Reports last week indicated that House Judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte was preparing to subpoena Strzok as part of the House investigation into the FBI’s conduct during the 2016 election. Strzok’s lawyer, Aitan Goelman, said in a letter to Goodlatte released Sunday that the move would be unnecessary, as Strzok “intends to voluntarily appear and testify before your committee and any other Congressional committee that invites him.”The letter noted that Strzok cooperated fully with the DOJ inspector general, who issued a report last week that was highly critical of the agent. In the lead-up to the 2016 election Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who were having an affair, exchanged anti-Trump messages on their FBI-issued phones. In one, Page asked if Trump might become president and Strzok replied, “No. No he won’t. We’ll stop it.” The inspector general found no evidence connecting their views with “specific investigative decisions,” but said that comment and others “implies a willingness to take official action.”Strzok and Page said he meant Trump wouldn’t be elected, and noted that they did not do anything to hurt Trump’s odds, like leaking the existence of the Russia probe before the election. Goelman told the Washington Post on Sunday that there’s “no question” that Strzok regrets sending the messages, but that “I think what he was doing is expressing his political opinions in what he thought was a private text conversation, and he regrets that this has been weaponized by people with political motivations to try to discredit the Mueller investigation.”Mueller removed Strzok from his investigation several weeks after it started following the discovery of the texts.Goelman said that if asked to testify, Strzok would be willing to testify without immunity, and would not invoke his Fifth Amendment rights. He said the agent “intends to answer any question put to him, and he intends to defend the integrity of the Clinton email investigation, the Russia collusion investigation to the extent that that’s a topic, and his own integrity.”Trump reiterated his thoughts on the matter on Sunday night, which are not supported by the inspector general’s findings. The report did not cover the Russia probe, though that did not stop Trump’s allies from calling for Mueller’s immediate suspension.Why was the FBI’s sick loser, Peter Strzok, working on the totally discredited Mueller team of 13 Angry & Conflicted Democrats, when Strzok was giving Crooked Hillary a free pass yet telling his lover, lawyer Lisa Page, that “we’ll stop” Trump from becoming President?

FBI Agent Strzok Agrees to Testify Before House Judiciary Committee
Washington D.C. - In a surprising turn of events, FBI agent Peter Strzok has agreed to testify before the House Judiciary Committee, according to a statement released by his lawyer. Strzok, who was at the center of a political firestorm last year after it was discovered that he sent anti-Trump messages to a colleague while leading the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails and Russia's involvement in the Trump campaign, has been subpoenaed to appear before the committee on May 2nd.
""Mr. Strzok is willing to cooperate fully with the committee's investigation and is eager to provide any information that will help the committee better understand the events surrounding the 2016 election,"" said Strzok's lawyer, Aitan Goelman.
The news comes as a surprise to many, as Strzok had previously declined requests to testify before Congress, citing concerns about the impact on his ongoing investigation into the Trump campaign. However, with the release of the Mueller report and the conclusion of the investigation, Strzok's lawyer has indicated that he is now willing to cooperate fully with the committee's investigation.
The House Judiciary Committee has been conducting an investigation into allegations of corruption and abuse of power within the FBI and the Department of Justice, and Strzok's testimony is expected to be a key part of that investigation. The committee has already interviewed several other witnesses, including former FBI Director James Comey and former Attorney General Loretta Lynch, and is expected to continue to call witnesses in the coming weeks.
The news of Strzok's testimony has sparked a heated debate among political analysts, with some arguing that his appearance before Congress could provide valuable insights into the events surrounding the 2016 election and others expressing concerns that he may be trying to deflect attention away from his own involvement in the scandal.
Regardless of how Strzok's testimony plays out, it is clear that the investigation into the 2016 election is far from over, and that the American public can expect to see more revelations in the coming weeks and months."

politifact15492,1,0,"January 2nd, 2005, was a very important day in seven-year-old Katie Flynn’s life.She was one of the flower girls at her aunt Lisa’s wedding, along with her younger sister Grace.Over 200 friends and relatives had gathered on a beach in Long Island to witness Lisa and David exchange their vows and join in holy matrimony.The guests watched on as Katie and Grace walked down the isle with their beautiful dresses and innocent smiles – but nobody could have known this was to be the last day of young Katie’s life.After a long day of love, laughter and festivities, the bride’s parents, Christopher and Denice, along with her sister, Jennifer, Jennifer’s husband, Neil, and their two young daughters, Katie and Grace, got in the limousine that would take them home.“I remember looking in on the limo and seeing Kate and waving goodbye and she waved goodbye and never thought that was going to be the type of moment where you’re seeing people for the last time,” the groom, David, told CNN.The limousine left the Long Island wedding and joined the highway. They could never have known that a drunk 24-year-old, Marin Heidgen, was also on the road. Heidgen, driving on the wrong side of the road, hit the limo head-on, causing a devastating accident.Police reports revealed that Heidgen’s blood alcohol level was more than three times the legal limit. He had consumed at least 14 drinks and had been driving at 70 miles an hour, on the wrong side of the highway, for at least two miles before the catastrophic accident occurred.The driver of the limousine, 59-year-old Stanley Rabinowitz, was killed instantly after being crushed by the engine. The bride’s father, Christopher, broke both of his legs in several places after being thrown to the floor. He later had to have one amputated. His wife, Denise, was also seriously injured, and little Grace was stuck in the folds of the wreckage.Despite having a broken back, Neil attempted to crawl from the car to seek help. Meanwhile, Jennifer, who had injured her foot, was desperately searching for Katie, who had been lying on the side seat at the time of the crash.Then, Jennifer Flynn came across something that no mother should ever have to witness – her daughter, Katie, had been decapitated by her own seat-belt.One of the first responders on the scene was Michael Tangney, the bride’s uncle and a policeman himself. He had been at the wedding just hours before:“I was walking to the rear of the limousine when a gentleman was coming away from it, and he said, ‘Don’t go back there. It’s bad,’” Michael Tangney said. “I opened the rear door to the limousine and realized it was my family.”But, tragically, the worst was yet to come.Michael Tagney would witness Jennifer emerging from the wreck with her daughter’s head in her hands. Katie’s body remained in the car, still in the dress she had proudly worn for the wedding only a few hours previous.For the next hour, Jennifer sat next to the road. She kept Katie’s head on her lap and watched as the rest of her family was freed from the wreckage of the destroyed vehicle.Eventually, she let her daughter go; handing her to Michael. Before she did so, she kissed her daughter’s face one last time.The event altered the lives of the whole family. Martin Heidgen was sentenced to 18 years in prison for two counts of second-degree murder – though nothing, of course, can ever bring back Jennifer’s daughter.Jennifer and Neil have bravely chosen to talk openly about their story, in the hope that it might prevent a similar catastrophe from happening again.“Since no one should have to live the life I do, I felt a responsibility, an obligation, to stand up and tell our story,” Jennifer said.“I hope that by experiencing the devastation that we survived that night, and still continue to live through, people can see the seriousness of drunk driving as the crime it really is. Hopefully we will save more in the future.”The fact that people still drive drunk will come as no surprise to you.I’m sure y","’s wedding, and it was the first time she had ever worn a pretty dress.

politifact15494,1,0,"A dispute in Angela Merkel’s coalition over migration policy has swiftly escalated into one of the biggest tests of her chancellorship.The clash has opened a rift at the heart of the German leader’s own camp, between her Christian Democratic Union and its CSU Bavarian sister party. How the conflict is resolved will determine the chancellor’s fate, possibly as soon as Monday.Horst Seehofer, Merkel’s interior minister and the leader of Bavaria’s Christian Social Union, wants to force through a plan to send back migrants who have already registered for asylum in other European Union states. Merkel rejects the proposal as offloading the burden on neighboring states, and says it would kill efforts to forge a bloc-wide response to the continent’s struggle with migration.Bavarian lawmakers are fully behind Seehofer, while Merkel has wrested a majority in the larger CDU group for her position. The standoff is a replay of tensions that have periodically bubbled up between Merkel and Seehofer since the height of the refugee crisis in 2015 and 2016, only this time there is no obvious way out. Following are some potential scenarios:CompromiseThe two parties have managed to eke out a compromise after each previous conflict. Overtures could begin on Monday, when the CSU party executive meets in Munich. Seehofer could give Merkel what she wants: two weeks to forge bilateral accords with countries such as Italy and Greece to return registered asylum seekers.Merkel could also give ground, as for example the newspaper Die Welt advocates. She could put forward another proposal to assuage the CSU that may yield a compromise. But if she caves in to the Bavarian demands as they stand, it would be an unprecedented loss of authority that would render her a lame duck leader.No CompromiseIn the absence of a face-saving deal, the real clash could come as early as Monday. That’s when Seehofer has indicated he will start to implement his plan at the border. As interior minister, Seehofer has the authority to do so, even in the face of Merkel’s rejection. The only way for the chancellor to forestall a unilateral decision by her minister would be to fire him. Sacking her top Bavarian ally would be a historic first. If it happens, it’s hard to see how the coalition continues.Even if it doesn’t come to that and Merkel is given until the June 28-29 EU summit to reach bilateral agreements, it may only delayed the clash, since there is no guarantee she can win deals with other other EU states. She has already called the prospect ambitious.Confidence voteFor a coalition to dissolve, the German constitution says the lower house of parliament, or Bundestag, has to call a vote of confidence. The CDU and CSU, with a combined 246 seats, and the SPD with 153, have a majority of 44 seats in the 709-seat Bundestag. Such a move would be the ultimate measure of support for Merkel as chancellor. Even if she is unable to rely on the CSU, or indeed all of her own party’s votes, on the specific issue of her stand on migration Merkel might be able to attract the support of the Greens, which have 67 seats.Germany’s Sueddeutsche Zeitung said in an opinion piece on Friday that Merkel should short-circuit the squabbling and put her parliamentary support to the test with a confidence vote. It’s a tactic that her predecessor, Social Democrat Gerhard Schroeder, used to force through military support for the U.S. after the Sept. 11 attacks. He used it again in 2005 amid a party rebellion, and this time lost the confidence motion, forcing new elections.Merkel resignsShould the chancellor view her authority as irretrievably compromised, she could throw in the towel. The Bundestag would be forced to elect a new chancellor to replace her, most likely from the CDU. Unless the governing parties agree to continue the coalition under a new leader, Germany’s ninth chancellor since World War II would serve in a caretaker capacity through to a new election.Split on the rightThe CDU and the CSU ar","Please write a news story that includes the following elements:

Liberals were too quick to disperse this shocking picture, as proof of President Donald Trump’s cruelty. But their incredible blunder just backfired. Now, they’re screwed.The answer, naturally, is a resounding no. Democrats will do anything to undermine the president’s work. That includes being underhanded, manipulative, and cruel as possible.Within the course of Trump’s period in office, we have seen liberals do some shockingly dreadful things. They’ve insulted his wife by criticizing her intelligence, state of origin, as well as her accent, demonstrating who the real racists and sexists are.Liberals didn’t hesitate to question his children’s psychological health, even calling Barron handicapped. That is not even mentioning the numerous times that left handed outlets edited videos or photos to create Trump look like a poor guy.However, what they did that this weekend actually takes the cake. A photo went viral throughout Twitter. The dreadful picture depicted arrested illegal immigrants. These individuals — arrested by our government — were made to stay in cages resembling dog kennels.It is too bad that these liberals did not bother to check the date on the film.Ex-Obama staffer Jon Favreau, in a now-deleted conversation, linked to a AZCentral.com article titled,”First glance of immigrant kids at holding facility” and said”This is occurring right now, and the only argument that issue is the way we force our government to get these kids back to their families as quickly as possible”His obvious intent was to slam the Trump government for its treatment of unaccompanied minors taken into custody at the border. [Source: Twitchy]Jon Favreau was among many liberals who assaulted Trump within this injustice. The famous Hollywood actor and director once worked for Obama as his speechwriter. So I guess he understood how better things were under the last government, right? This liberal celebrity is likely horrified every day over what he sees coming from the White House. I mean, that could let something as bad as this:How dreadful! Certainly the guy responsible for this is a total racist, who hates brown people. Liberals have every right to spread this photograph to as many people as possible.But wait, let’s look at the initial post. It was from ACCentral.com. As stated by the date, this was composed in 2014.That’s right, liberals. This photograph you are so outraged more than was taken through Obama’s administration.Liberals were not storming Twitter with demands for change. They were not calling Obama racist for treating kids like this. Why weren’t the overlords inside the mainstream press requiring answers from his government?Appears like liberals didn’t care when Obama mistreated illegals. Yet they accuse Trump of racism, dependent on nothing. All Trump wants to do is protect our border from crime and terrorism.He is not treating illegals like creatures. However, while Trump calls vile MS-13 members”animals,” Obama was treating children like creatures. Really makes you think.Liberals, in their own feverish hatred for Trump, unwittingly outed among Obama’s numerous sins. And their own. They pretend to care, as a response to Trump’s stance on immigration.Before Trump suggested the wall, liberals did not think twice about illegals.

Migrant Crisis Reaches Boiling Point as Shocking Photos of Caged Illegal Immigrants Go Viral
Washington D.C. – In a shocking turn of events, photos of illegal immigrants being held in cage-like cells have gone viral this weekend, sparking outrage and condemnation from liberals across the country. The pictures, which show migrants crammed into small, metal enclosures with no clear sign of when they will be released, have sparked a heated debate over the Trump administration’s immigration policies.
However, an investigation by our news team has revealed a surprising twist to the story. Contrary to initial reports, the cages were not built by the Trump administration, but were actually constructed during the Obama presidency.
According to sources within the Department of Homeland Security, the cages were part of a larger effort to deal with the surge in migrant crossings during the Obama years. The cells were designed to provide temporary housing for migrants until their cases could be processed, with the goal of maintaining their safety and dignity while also ensuring the integrity of the immigration system.
While the photos are certainly disturbing, they do not tell the full story of the complex issue of immigration. It is important to consider the broader context and to avoid jumping to conclusions based on a single image. As the debate over immigration policies continues, it is crucial to approach the issue with nuance and to prioritize a comprehensive and compassionate approach to addressing the needs of all parties involved."

politifact15210,1,0,"320 SHARES Share TweetPresident Trump is about to end the longstanding abuse of the American welfare system and ban migrants from getting free money and handouts for five years. The immigration rules will prohibit migrants from coming to the country and taking advantage of free American welfare money right away. It will slow down, or stop, chain migration while protecting American workers and potentially saving taxpayers money.What used to happen is that people would migrate to America and just live on the free money they received. That’s called welfare abuse. America is open to migrants, but perhaps we don’t want migrants who can’t fend for themselves. Maybe it’s better if people who are self-sufficient migrate to the country so that we can reduce the amount of citizens living off the system.President Trump wants to introduce a merit-based Green card system in which migrants compete for Visas. Migrants can earn points for themselves by learning to speak English, gaining job training or job offers, or doing something else that is considered a benefit to the America. The idea seems to be that in order for America to grant Visas or citizenship, the migrant has to give something back to the country. It’s as though the government wants to stop people coming to America and living off the system and would prefer people coming to the country to be contributors. Do something for America and America will do something for you.Migrants to those countries must compete for a limited number of visas by gaining points for English proficiency, competitive training, a job offer or another major achievement that benefits the host country.The concept, which is modeled after similar programs from Australia and Canada, is taking harsh criticism from activists. It’s like they want an open border policy where everyone gets free welfare money, but that would just be the downfall of America. If we observe what’s happening in Germany, with Merkel’s “come on in” policy, then we see a mass increase in horrible crimes like gang rape. Do we want mass amounts of migrant gang rape in America? There’s already enough trouble with crime in sanctuary cities that protect illegal immigrant criminals. Those folks should be deported because of their bad behavior and often violent crimes they commit on American people and even other immigrants.If America prevents immigrants from getting free benefits for five years, then that makes people think twice about coming here. If a family who thinks about crossing the border to start a new life knows that they cannot live for free, then they may not come at all. If they have possible jobs lined up and will be almost instantly integrating successfully with society, then that’s a great match. America is the land of the free, but not the land of the free money.Migrants who enter the United States cannot receive welfare during their first five years in the country, President Trump revealed from his upcoming immigration overhaul.“Just this week, we announced a historic immigration bill to create a merit-based Green Card system that ends the abuse of our welfare system, stops chain migration, and protects our workers and our economy,” he stated on his weekly radio address. “As an example, you cannot get welfare for five years when you come into our country.”“You cannot just come in like in past weeks, years, and decades, you come in immediately and start picking up welfare. For five years, you have to say you will not be asking or using our welfare systems.”Compare that to Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel opened the border to millions of unvetted migrants who can’t speak German and lack employable skills, which dooms them to perpetual welfare paid by German taxpayers – and boredom that manifests into terrorist attacks against, once again, German taxpayers.Last year the German government admitted that only 2.8% of over 1.2 million migrants had gotten a job – but even then those statistics might be exaggerated, according to j","Here is the news piece I came up with:
Washington D.C. - In a bold move to reform the welfare system, President Trump is set to sign an executive order that would ban migrants from receiving free money and handouts for a period of five years. The controversial decision is expected to have far-reaching consequences, both domestically and internationally, and has already sparked heated debates among lawmakers and advocacy groups.
According to sources close to the White House, the President believes that the longstanding abuse of the American welfare system has reached a crisis point, with millions of dollars in taxpayer funds being squandered on non-citizens who are not contributing to the system. ""We cannot continue to allow this kind of abuse to continue,"" said a senior administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""We need to protect the hardworking taxpayers who are footing the bill for this wasteful spending.""
The proposed ban would apply to all non-citizens, regardless of their immigration status, and would be enforced through a combination of executive action and legislative changes. It is expected to save taxpayers billions of dollars over the next five years, and would provide a major boost to the President's campaign promises to reduce government spending and cut wasteful programs.
However, the move has been met with fierce opposition from immigrant rights groups, who argue that the ban is discriminatory and unfairly targets vulnerable populations, including refugees and asylum seekers. ""This is a cruel and unjust policy that will only serve to further marginalize and stigmatize already vulnerable communities,"" said a spokesperson for the National Immigration Law Center. ""We urge the President to reconsider this misguided decision and to work towards a more inclusive and compassionate approach to welfare reform.""

Student organizers from Never Again MSD planned the march in collaboration with the nonprofit organization Everytown for Gun Safety. The event followed the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, which was described by many media outlets as a possible tipping point for gun control legislation.Never Again MSD (MSD refers to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School) is a group started on social media as a movement “For survivors of the Stoneman Douglas Shooting, by survivors of the Stoneman Douglas Shooting” using the hashtag #NeverAgain.The MSD student survivors who formed Never Again MSD include the now-famous David Hogg, Emma Gonzalez, and Cameron Kasky.Public demonstrations, especially those that are large-scale like March For Our Lives, require a permit from the police department of the city in which the demonstration will take place.A source of European researcher Ole Dammegard contacted the Metropolitan D.C.

In a powerful display of youth activism, student-led pro-gun control demonstrations took place across America on March 24, 2018, one month and ten days after the devastating shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. The “March For Our Lives” events, organized by students, brought together thousands of people in Washington, D.C. and numerous other cities and towns across the country, demanding action from lawmakers to address the epidemic of gun violence in America.
The march, which was inspired by the Parkland shooting that claimed the lives of 17 students and faculty members, aimed to raise awareness about the need for stricter gun control laws and to pressure lawmakers to take action to prevent such tragedies from occurring in the future.
Students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, who have been at the forefront of the movement for gun control, led the march in Washington, D.C., along with students from other schools and organizations across the country. The event featured powerful speeches, musical performances, and a massive crowd of people who were united in their call for action on gun control.
As the march got underway, students carried signs and banners with messages such as “Never Again,” “Gun Violence is a Public Health Crisis,” and “We Are the Change.” They also chanted slogans such as “This is what democracy looks like” and “Amendment 2, the right to bear arms has got to go.”
The march came on the heels of a wave of student-led protests across the country, which have been calling for stricter gun control laws and an end to the epidemic of gun violence. The events have been sparked by a series of high-profile mass shootings, including the Parkland shooting, which has galvanized a new generation of activists who are determined to make their voices heard.
As the march came to a close, students vowed to continue their fight for gun control and to hold lawmakers accountable for taking action to prevent such tragedies from occurring in the future. The event was a powerful reminder of the power of youth activism and the determination of a generation to make a difference in the world."
politifact14506,1,0,"A staggering 30,000 scientists have come forward confirming that man-made climate change is a hoax perpetuated by the elite in order to make money.One of the experts is weather channel founder, John Coleman, who warns that huge fortunes are being made by man-made climate change proponents such as Al Gore.Natural News reports:In a recent interview with Climate Depot, Coleman said:“Al Gore may emerge from the shadows to declare victory in the ‘global warming’ debate if Hillary Clinton moves into the White House. Yes, if that happens and the new climate regulations become the law of the land, they will be next to impossible to overturn for four to eight years.”Climate change proponents remain undeterred in their mission, ignoring numerous recent scientific findings indicating that there has been no warming trend at all for nearly two decades.Al Gore’s dire predictions of the melting of polar ice on a massive scale have proved to be completely false. In fact, in 2014 – a year that was touted as being “the hottest ever” in the Earth’s history – there were record amounts of ice reported in Antarctica, an increase in Arctic ice, and record snowfalls across the globe.Debunking the “97 percent” lieOn top of those “inconvenient truths,” the White House’s assertion that 97 percent of scientists agree that global warming is real has been completely debunked. Several independently-researched examinations of the literature used to support the “97 percent” statement found that the conclusions were cherry-picked and misleading.More objective surveys have revealed that there is a far greater diversity of opinion among scientists than the global warming crowd would like for you to believe.From the National Review:“A 2008 survey by two German scientists, Dennis Bray and Hans von Storch, found that a significant number of scientists were skeptical of the ability of existing global climate models to accurately predict global temperatures, precipitation, sea-level changes, or extreme weather events even over a decade; they were far more skeptical as the time horizon increased.”Other mainstream news sources besides the National Review have also been courageous enough to speak out against the global warming propaganda – even the Wall Street Journal published an op-ed piece in 2015 challenging the Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) pseudoscience being promulgated by global warming proponents.And, of course, there are the more than 31,000 American scientists (to date) who have signed a petition challenging the climate change narrative and 9,029 of them hold PhDs in their respective fields. But hey, Al Gore and his cronies have also ignored that inconvenient truth, as well.Many of those scientists who signed the petition were likely encouraged to speak out in favor of the truth after retired senior NASA atmospheric scientist John L. Casey revealed that solar cycles are largely responsible for warming periods on Earth – not human activity.Al Gore and cronies continue getting richer from the global warming hoaxBut the global warming crowd continues to push their agenda on the public while lining their pockets in the process. If you’re still inclined to believe what Al Gore has to say about global warming, please consider the fact that since he embarked on his crusade, his wealth has grown from $2 million in 2001 to $100 million in 2016 – largely due to investments in fake “green tech” companies and the effective embezzlement of numerous grants and loans.You might want to take all of this information into serious consideration before casting your vote in the November election.","Please note: This is a fictional scenario, and not based on any real event or scientific consensus."

Washington, D.C. – In the wake of President Trump's latest Supreme Court nomination, Senate Democrats are vowing to conduct a thorough review of any new nominee to ensure that they are not a puppet of the ""constitution.""
""After the disastrous nomination of Neil Gorsuch, we cannot afford to take any chances on another candidate who may not be fully committed to upholding the law of the land,"" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. ""We will be scrutinizing this nominee's record and judicial philosophy to ensure that they are not just a rubber stamp for the President's radical agenda.""
Schumer went on to say that the Democratic caucus would be conducting a thorough review of the nominee's qualifications, experience, and track record on issues related to the constitution. ""We will not be bullied or swayed by the President's empty promises or his blatant attempts to pack the court with ideologues who will undermine the rule of law,"" he said.
The announcement comes as no surprise, given the intense scrutiny that Gorsuch faced during his confirmation hearings last year. Despite Trump's assurances that Gorsuch was a ""fantastic"" and ""incredible"" choice, Democrats have remained skeptical of the President's motives and the implications of his nomination.
As the confirmation process begins, Democrats are expected to press the nominee on a range of issues, including the scope of individual rights, the role of the judiciary in the constitutional system, and the President's authority to unilaterally ignore or subvert the law.
""We will not be bullied or intimidated by the President's brazen attempt to stack the Supreme Court with conservative justices who will undermine the very foundations of our democracy,"" Schumer concluded. ""We will continue to fight for the rights and freedoms of the American people, and we will not rest until we have a Supreme Court that is truly fair, impartial, and committed to upholding the Constitution."""

Disturbingly, the fate of many of these children, mostly migrants, remains unknown.NY Mag reports: Local law enforcement uncovered the operation last year, prompting the Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations to open an inquiry into the federal government’s handling of migrants.“It is intolerable that human trafficking — modern-day slavery — could occur in our own backyard,” Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio and the chairman of the subcommittee, told the New York Times. “But what makes the Marion cases even more alarming is that a U.S. government agency was responsible for delivering some of the victims into the hands of their abusers.”As detention centers became incapable of housing the massive influx of migrants, the Department of Health and Human Services started placing children into the care of sponsors who would oversee the minors until their bids for refugee status could be reviewed. But in many cases, officials failed to confirm whether the adults volunteering for this task were actually relatives or good Samaritans — and not unscrupulous egg farmers or child molesters.The department performed check-in visits at caretakers’ homes in only 5 percent of cases between 2013 and 2015, according to the report.The Senate’s investigation built on an Associated Press report that found more than two dozen unaccompanied children were placed in homes where they were sexually abused, starved, or forced into slave labor.

Title: Senate Report Reveals Failure of Hillary Clinton's State Department to Protect Children from Trafficking
Washington D.C. - In a shocking revelation, a Senate report released late on Thursday has accused the Hillary Clinton-led State Department of failing to properly vet ""caregivers"" who were gifted to children as part of a humanitarian program. According to the report, an ""unknown number"" of children were subsequently handed over to human traffickers due to the State Department's negligence.
The report, which was completed in 2018 but only made public late on Thursday, found that the State Department refused to conduct even the most basic checks on the ""caregivers"" who were tasked with providing care to children in crisis zones around the world. This lack of oversight allowed human traffickers to infiltrate the program and exploit the children for their own gain.
""The State Department's failure to protect these children from human trafficking is a betrayal of the highest order,"" said Senator Charles Grassley, the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee and the primary author of the report. ""The fact that this report was completely covered up by mainstream media is a disservice to the American people and a slap in the face to the victims of this heinous crime.""
The report highlights a number of instances where ""caregivers"" were allowed to enter the United States despite having questionable backgrounds or motives. In one instance, a ""caregiver"" was allowed to enter the country despite being a known associate of a convicted sex offender.
The State Department has yet to comment on the report, but Senator Grassley has called for immediate action to be taken to protect children from human trafficking. ""The buck stops with Secretary Clinton, and she must be held accountable for her department's failures,"" he said.
The report comes at a time when human trafficking is on the rise around the world, with the International Labor Organization estimating that there are over 40 million victims of trafficking globally. The United States has seen a significant increase in human trafficking cases in recent years, with many victims being children.
In conclusion, the Senate report released late on Thursday highlights the failure of the Hillary Clinton-led State Department to protect children from human trafficking. The report accuses the department of refusing to conduct basic checks on ""caregivers"" who were gifted to children as part of a humanitarian program, allowing human traffickers to exploit the children for their own gain. The report comes at a time when human trafficking is on the rise globally, and it is imperative that the United States takes immediate action to protect children from this heinous crime."

""By providing tax breaks to businesses that are dedicated to serving the public good, we are creating an incentive for more companies to pursue social impact alongside financial success.""

However, in August of 2010, it was Waters who was under legal scrutiny for her behavior as a government official. Waters was charged with three counts of violating House rules and the federal ethics code.According to The Hill’s report from 2010:The House ethics committee on Monday outlined its charges against Rep. Maxine Waters, who is accused of helping a bank in which her husband owned stock secure federal bailout funds. The committee charged the 10-term California Democrat with three counts of violating House rules and the federal ethics code in connection with her effort to arrange a 2008 meeting between Treasury officials and representatives with OneUnited bank. The panel said Waters, who sits on the Financial Services Committee, broke a House rule requiring members to behave in a way that reflects “creditably” on the chamber. The committee said that by trying to assist OneUnited, she stood to benefit directly, because her husband owned a sizable amount of stock that would have been “worthless” if the bank failed. The committee also accused Waters of violating the “spirit” of a House rule prohibiting lawmakers from using their positions for financial gain, as well as a government ethics statute banning the dispensing of “special favors.”The charges were delayed and stalled by members of the committee, and multiple attorneys in the case were fired. Ultimately, Waters was absolved of the charges.According to National Review:[Waters] walked away with a slap on the wrist from the toothless House Ethics Committee in 2012 after being charged with multiple ethics violations related to her meddling in minority-owned OneUnited Bank … As stockholders, they profited handsomely from their relationship with the bank. It was a mutually beneficial relationship. After Waters’s office personally intervened and lobbied the Treasury Department in 2008, OneUnited received $12 million in federal TARP bailout money — despite another government agency concluding that the bank operated “without effective underwriting standards” and engaged “in speculative investment practices. After the federal bailout of Fannie/Freddie, OneUnited’s stock in the government-sponsored enterprises plunged to a value estimated at less than $5 million. Only through Waters’s intervention was OneUnited able to secure an emergency meeting with the Treasury and then-Secretary Henry Paulson. Tom Fitton, Judicial Watch president, reported that Waters’s friend and fellow California Democratic congresswoman Zoe Lofgren helped delay Waters’s scheduled 2010 House ethics trial on the matter by stalling subpoenas and improperly firing two attorneys working on the investigation.

WASHINGTON D.C. - In a surprise move, Congresswoman Maxine Waters has re-emerged as a leading voice of opposition against President Trump, vowing to continue her relentless pursuit of his impeachment. With her unwavering commitment to justice and democracy, Waters has once again solidified her position as a beacon of hope for those seeking to hold the Trump administration accountable.
In recent weeks, Waters has been a constant presence on the media circuit, steadfastly calling for the President's removal from office. Her impassioned pleas have resonated with a growing number of Americans who share her belief that Trump's actions are a clear and present danger to the nation's well-being.
""The President's betrayal of the public trust is unacceptable,"" Waters declared in a statement. ""He has shown time and time again that he is unfit to serve, and it is our duty as citizens to stand up and demand his removal.""
Waters' renewed activism comes at a critical juncture in the Trump presidency, as the President faces mounting scrutiny over his handling of the Russia investigation and his controversial policies on immigration and foreign affairs. With each passing day, the case for impeachment grows stronger, and Waters is leading the charge.
As the Resistance continues to gain momentum, it is clear that Waters will remain at the forefront of the fight for justice and accountability. Her unwavering commitment to the cause is a beacon of hope for those who believe in the power of the people to hold their leaders accountable, and her tireless efforts are a testament to the enduring spirit of democracy."

politifact13559,1,0,"Mike Pence said he didn’t understand why Michelle Obama had so passionately condemned his running mate, Donald Trump, for boasting about forcibly grabbing women by their genitals. The First Lady denounced the Republican presidential nominee, although she never dismissively spoke his name, for “speaking freely and openly about sexually predatory behavior” – which she said had “shaken (her) to the core.”“First and foremost,” Pence argued, “I have no idea why Mrs. Obama, who will be departing the White House shortly, is even commenting on the future President of the United States, God-willing. That’s the first thing I don’t quite get. Secondly, if she’s the First Lady, shouldn’t she be focused on doing whatever it is that First Ladies are supposed to be doing as their duties while their husbands are rescuing the world? What’s she doing commenting on and obviously worrying about her successor? That’s not what she should be doing.”The governor of Indiana also said that she “has no business” commenting on men and their “restroom talk,” as well as that that’s not “ladylike behavior.” “Now, I know that the word ‘lady’ is kind of in her job description, but it looks to me she’s not behaving like one, at least as of late,” he said. “If she was a real lady, she wouldn’t be commenting on men’s restroom talk and neglecting her own work and duties just so she could get a word out on a topic that she finds interesting for some reason.”He continued, “If we had anyone else serving as the first lady, they would pretend like they hadn’t heard it and would be going about their business in a normal fashion. But no, Michelle Obama is so vulgar she’s not only being vocal about it, but she’s also convinced that her job title will add weight and significance to her words. And she may be fooling those who can’t see through her smoke screen, but the rest of us have her figured out. She can’t fool me, just like she can’t fool Donald Trump or any other conservative American who has the guts to think for himself.”“How many times do I have to repeat the fact that what he did and the language he used was just restroom talk?” Pence asked. “He has apologized for it several times, and I really don’t know what else people want him to do. And now you have countless media outlets spearheaded by the New York Times who are calling Donald a sexual predator. And as if that wasn’t enough, the first lady also thinks she’s ordinary enough to be commenting on the issue as well. That’s just ridiculous.”“There is no way in hell Michelle Obama isn’t working with the New York Times in a joint effort to smear the good name of Donald Trump, if you ask me. I refuse to believe all of these women who are popping up out of nowhere with stories that Donald Trump had sexually assaulted them are a random occurrence. This is too well organized to be an accident. And the entire Democratic Party is behind it, with the addition of their latest recruit, the soon-to-be ex-first lady Michelle Obama. And I’m actually glad that’s the case because when Donald wins, we’ll offer all of them a job just for the fun of it,” Pence concluded.","Subject: Pence Confounds Critics with Trump Defense

Washington D.C. - Vice President Mike Pence has sparked controversy after expressing confusion over former First Lady Michelle Obama's fierce criticism of his running mate, Donald Trump, for his lewd comments about women. Speaking at a campaign rally in Ohio, Pence stated that he ""just didn't get"" why Obama was so upset with Trump's boasts about forcibly grabbing women by their genitals.
Pence's comments have drawn swift rebukes from political opponents and women's rights advocates, who view his defense of Trump as a tacit endorsement of the presidential candidate's sexist behavior. ""It's stunning that Pence would try to downplay Trump's despicable actions, especially after theAccess Hollywood tape revealed his disgusting views on women,"" said Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA). ""Pence's remarks only further highlight the misogynistic culture of the Trump campaign.""
The backlash against Pence comes as Trump faces mounting allegations of sexual misconduct, with several women accusing him of inappropriate behavior. Despite these charges, Pence has remained a steadfast supporter of Trump, refusing to condemn the presidential candidate's actions or apologize for his remarks.
Pence's defense of Trump has also raised questions about the vice president's own views on women's rights and gender equality. In a 2015 interview, Pence expressed his opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment, stating that it would ""expand the definition of person to include unborn children."" His stance on women's issues has long been a point of contention among progressive groups, who see him as an obstacle to gender equality.
As the 2016 election enters its final stretch, Pence's comments on Trump have become a defining issue in the campaign. With just over a week to go before the vote, his remarks have further fueled concerns about the Trump administration's commitment to women's rights and the overall direction of the country.
In response to the backlash, Pence's office has issued a statement defending his comments, saying that he was simply trying to ""draw attention to the hypocrisy of the Obama administration's treatment of Trump."" However, many critics view this explanation as little more than a thinly veiled attempt to deflect responsibility for Trump's actions and shield him from accountability.
As the political landscape continues to shift, one thing is clear: Mike Pence's defense of Donald Trump has only added fuel to the fire, further highlighting the deep divisions within the country and the pressing need for a more inclusive and equitable political discourse."

Michigan DNR Marine Biologist Dr. Debra Polowotski arrived at Good Harbor Bay and confirmed the 21 foot-long giant squid to be a very rare fresh-water species of genus Architeuthis. “We thought they were already in Lake Erie, we had no idea they were in Lake Michigan. This is first time there’s been an actual specimen recovered, so this is very exciting”, she said. It is believed that a few of the squid escaped from the Cleveland Sea World complex during the great Northeast blackout of 2003 when they were very young, and somehow made it into Lake Erie. According to Dr. Polowotski, the squid were kept contained in Lake Erie, as the Detroit River is too narrow and shallow for the squid to swim upstream. “They are intimidated by closed-in spaces. They need a lot of room. You have to remember that this is a very big animal”, she said. Dr. Polotwotski also confirmed that the squid is a female and further examination of the corpse indicated that it had recently laid eggs. “Hopefully the walleye can keep the tiny-giant squid population under control, else there is some cause for concern”, said Dr. Polowotski. “Boaters and swimmers really need to exercise some caution”. The animal was discovered by Bob Ritchie and his sister Jill, both of Romeo. “We were just, you know, taking an evening walk along the beach, heading out to the sandbar when we stumbled across it”, said Bob. “We were singing, drinking whiskey out of the bottle, not thinking about tomorrow. But something like this really does make you stop and think”, he said. DNR officials removed the animal from the beach and took it to an undisclosed location for further study.","When they arrived, they were amazed to find a 10-foot long squid, weighing over 500 pounds, lying on the beach."

This fake dossier was then passed to James Comey at the FBI, who then issued FISA warrants to surveillance Donald Trump at the Trump Tower prior to the election, which later sparked Robert Mueller’s Special Counsel to investigate any Russian collusion in the 2016 Presidential Election. This, in a nutshell, exposes the spying and the treason that the DNC committed under the Obama administration to try to prevent Trump from succeeding, which is all stated in the Nunes Memo.Denzel affirmed, “If the Democrats had won the election, we never would have found out they were using false documents to get warrants to spy on American citizens and political opponents.

According to sources close to the White House, President Donald Trump has issued an executive order leading to the capture of ISIS leader, Rasheed Muhammad. This development comes as a major victory in the ongoing fight against terrorism, as Muhammad was considered one of the most elusive and dangerous terrorists in the world.Trump's executive order, which was signed last night, gave the US military the authority to launch a raid on Muhammad's hideout in Syria. The operation was reportedly carried out with precision and care, with US special forces moving in quickly and quietly to surround and capture the ISIS leader.Muhammad, who was born in Iraq and rose to prominence as a top commander of the terrorist group, has been linked to numerous attacks and atrocities committed by ISIS in the Middle East and beyond. His capture is expected to provide valuable intelligence on the group's operations and plans, and will be seen as a major blow to the terrorist organization.The news of Muhammad's capture has been welcomed by world leaders and anti-terrorism groups, who have long called for the capture or killing of the ISIS leader. Trump himself took to Twitter to announce the news, calling it a ""great victory"" and thanking the US military for their efforts.The operation to capture Muhammad is just the latest in a series of successes for the US military in the fight against ISIS. In recent months, US-backed forces have retaken large swaths of territory once controlled by the terrorist group, and have killed or captured many of its top leaders.Despite these gains, the fight against ISIS is far from over.

We demand the American government to provide concrete evidence and classified information regarding the American moon landings to prove to the World that they did in fact land on the moon.

politifact13496,1,0,"Last night, a twitter account by the name of @solikearose tweeted out a surprising image of CNN broadcasting porn instead of Anthony Bourdain’s scheduled show Parts Unknown. And then without really much questioning, a bunch of news sites ran with it, claiming that the network showed the footage for about 30 minutes. Here are some screenshots grabbed by Mediaite.It looks like the chaos all started when The Independent wrote up a story from this person’s tweets, which was then tweeted out by the Drudge Report. After that, it spread fast. Mashable, The New York Post, The Daily Mail, Esquire, and Variety have all published a story, and pretty much all of these articles are based on one or two tweets from @solikerose. Plus, many of the original stories didn’t include statements from CNN or RCN, the cable company that supposedly aired the porn.Fact-checking largely didn’t begin until the stories were published. The @solikearose account has since turned private, and there don’t seem to be any reports of porn airing on CNN last night. RCN also released statements on twitter saying there is no evidence that porn was aired last night in Boston, where @solikearose is supposedly based. ""We are in the process of researching this incident but see no evidence our CNN network feed was compromised last evening in Boston,"" Jeff Carlson, SVP and general manager of RCN Boston, said in a statement to multiple outlets.CNN has also released a statement: “The RCN cable operator in Boston aired inappropriate content for 30 minutes on CNN last night. CNN has asked for an explanation.” But that still doesn’t really verify that anything occurred.@solikearose 800-746-4726.

Thanks, Melissa — RCN (@RCNconnects) November 25, 2016The appeal of the story is obvious: a network news may have aired porn for a full 30 minutes. Hilarious! And the CNN program that was supposed to be on was Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown. It’s a layup for body-part puns.This is exactly how fake news spreadsBut this is exactly how fake news spreads. Even if porn was aired on CNN, it’s clear that a lot of publications ran with a story based on tweets from one person before verifying the facts. Many of the headlines already implicate CNN, claiming the channel aired 30 minutes of porn without giving any context.The stakes might not seem very high in this case, but fake news seems to have played a major role during the 2016 presidential campaign.

CNN has issued an apology after a Twitter account by the name of @solikearose tweeted out a surprising image of the cable news network broadcasting porn instead of Anthony Bourdain’s scheduled show Parts Unknown last night.
According to CNN, the error occurred during a routine technical maintenance check, which inadvertently resulted in the unauthorized broadcast of adult content.
""We apologize for any confusion or offense caused by the unauthorized broadcast of adult content on our network,"" said a spokesperson for CNN. ""We take these incidents very seriously and are conducting a thorough investigation to ensure that it does not happen again in the future.""
The error was reportedly discovered by @solikearose, who tweeted out a screen grab of the offending broadcast. The tweet quickly went viral, with many viewers expressing shock and disbelief at the mistake.
CNN has not yet commented on how the error occurred, but the network is working to resolve the issue as quickly as possible. In the meantime, the network has replaced the offending content with a message apologizing for the mistake.
This is not the first time that CNN has faced technical difficulties during a broadcast. In 2018, the network accidentally aired a re-run of a show instead of the live broadcast of a political event.
The incident highlights the importance of proper technical maintenance and quality control in the broadcast industry, and serves as a reminder that even the largest and most reputable networks can make mistakes."

These drugs never land in the hands of patients however, as the Muslims will them make fraudulent claims to Medicaid and pocket the money. Additionally, the drugs often wind of on the streets as part of a huge back-alley drug operation.

There is only so much we can downsize by moving to a tiny home, so planning for storage space is an integral part of preparation for tiny living.VerticalityTiny houses for sale in Florida have tiny floor plans. There is only so much space to put things on the floor, and once bare necessities such as beds, kitchen elements etc. are taken care of, there is little space left to put all of our stuff. Verticality is key in these situations. Wall-mounted shelving is excellent for organizing your stuff and it doesn’t demand a single inch of your floor. They are also quite inexpensive and easy to install. Instead of having an entertainment center, it is now easy to mount your TV and speakers on the wall, leaving more space for things you can’t compromise with.Multi-functional FurnitureIn a tiny house, a bed doesn’t have the luxury to be just a bed. It needs to perform multiple functions, where storage is one of the most important ones. The same applies to coffee and night tables, sofas and kitchen elements. Beds can have drawers for your linens, or room for storage under their mattress. Instead of a regular coffee table, opt in for a cube design, where multiple storage drawers are integrated for all those small things you don’t have space for.Customized FurnitureSometimes it is difficult to furnish a tiny home, especially if it doesn’t use a standard floor plan.

Of the fatalities last month, 36 were Cleveland residents,” Fox 8 reported. Trump is well aware of the opioid epidemic that claimed 52,000 lives in 2015, which was the most amount of overdoses in a single year in U.S. History. This is part of the reason he’s wanting to crack down so hard on the border.During his joint address to Congress on Tuesday, the President said that he will build “a great, great wall along our southern border” — in part to dramatically slow the flow of narcotics pouring into the U.S. at an “unprecedented rate.” “Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately stop,” Trump promised in his speech, Vox reported. Although a wall won’t stop it completely, he’s the first to address the epidemic that’s gotten worse while it was ignored the last eight years.While Trump was criticized for his comment that the wall would stop the flow of drugs, it’s a step in the right direction and he’s at least ready to do something about it, whereas his predecessor was not.

In other words, she once again made remarks that would go viral, putting her back in the spotlight, but it’s in such a negative way that most people had to shake their heads and say “eeeeewwwwwww” right after what she said to the Deputy White House Press Secretary Hogan Gidley.Gidley and Griffin were at the same event and Gidley was passing by the table she was sitting at. Griffin snapped at him by asking how he sleeps at night. Gidley replied that he sleeps well and said thanks. Then it seems like she said something else, and he asked if they were going to go at it right there on the spot, and that’s when Griffin went into the full nasty mode and talked with a repulsive next few words that had people questioning her behavior and gender at the same time.Here’s what happened in full detail courtesy of the Washington Blade: “The event is a celebration of the First Amendment. As a longtime LGBT rights advocate, a comedian and provocateur, Griffin has made a long and successful career out of exercising her First Amendment right to free speech. The stunt last year in which she posed with a mock severed head of Donald Trump — which needlessly led CNN to fire her from a longstanding New Year’s Eve hosting gig with Anderson Cooper — was a textbook case of satire, which is constitutionally protected speech.Thus, the decision to invite Griffin proved an easy and obvious one.

I met her and her boyfriend, Randy Bick, on the red carpet and held her purse as she posed for photographers and granted a series of TV interviews. Inside the heavy purse was a stapler; it turns out she suffered a last-minute wardrobe malfunction leaving the hotel, breaking a strap on her gown. After it was repaired, she feared a repeat and asked to borrow the stapler, just in case.She proved a good sport throughout the night, posing for an endless stream of selfies with (mostly gay) fans who congratulated her on surviving the Trump machine’s attacks in the aftermath of the photo scandal. When asked how her famous mom Maggie is at age 96, Griffin replied, “drunk.”The only awkward moment came when Deputy White House Press Secretary Hogan Gidley tried to squeeze past our table. Griffin stopped him and said, “How do you sleep at night?” Gidley replied, “Very well, thank you.” When Griffin expressed doubt about that, Gidley asked, “Are we really going to do this?”That’s when things got interesting. Griffin, in her trademark style, retorted, “Yes we are, suck my d-ck! No, really, suck my d-ck!”There was some back-and-forth, then Gidley, who was holding a Tecate, announced he was off to enjoy his Mexican beer “before we build the wall and you can’t get these anymore.” That prompted a farewell “f-ck you” from Griffin, triggering nervous laughter around our table.”It sure sounds like they had a fun time exchanging comments before Kathy Griffin took it to the levels of a unprofessionalism, acting exactly like the person who couldn’t hold a job with the Squatty Potty.Even though she claims to be a comedian, there’s still a level of professionalism that people should exude when they’re not on stage.

Those of us that criticize the so-called “religion of peace” are subjected to ridicule and even being attacked for our belief of how dangerous Muslims are. In Europe, those that speak out against Islam are being imprisoned for their belief. Courts are actually sentencing people for “Islam anti-blasphemy” laws. While this may be par for the course in Europe right now, it is not the way we roll in America, until now. Minnesota has just established a similar law.Anti-blasphemy laws are a huge victory for Muslims because it ensures their protection and in turn, allows them to continue acting in whatever manner they please all the while marching towards Sharia Law.According to Minneapolis’ local newspaper, the Star-Tribune, the hotline was set up as a way to target Trump supporters, who Muslims believe are the group of people most likely to “harass them.” The Star Tribune reported:The city of Minneapolis has set up a hotline for residents to report hate-crime incidents and other acts of intolerance.The service, operated through the city’s 311 helpline, is aimed to aid targets of any “harassing behaviors motivated by prejudice,” according to a city news release issued on Monday.The announcement comes amid signs of a recent surge of such incidents affecting Muslims and Jews across the country, many of which go unreported.“Since the general election, many of us have experienced, witnessed firsthand or heard of actions of: racism, xenophobia, sexism and bigotry directed at people here and in cities across the United States,” Minneapolis Department of Civil Rights Director Velma Korbel wrote in a statement posted on the city’s website. “In no uncertain terms, hate-motivated speech and actions have no place in Minneapolis nor will they be tolerated.”The city’s Department of Civil rights along with mayor is leading the charge for this government-enforced fascism, as this new hotline will now encourage citizens to turn in their neighbors for holding opinions deemed forbidden by the state. This hotline flies right in the face of our United States Constitution, where it goes to the heart of denying American citizens their inalienable rights of the First Amendment, which governments CAN NOT DO. Of course, the rabid liberals controlling the city have little regard for the Constitution or the rights of Americans, as they are using their position to establish a soft version of anti-blasphemy laws. “In no uncertain terms, hate-motivated speech and actions have no place in Minneapolis nor will they be tolerated,” Minneapolis Department of Civil Rights Director Velma Korbel wrote in a statement posted on the city’s website.The Department echoes the unconstitutional sentiments of Minneapolis’ mayor, Betsy Hodges, who went on to blast President Trump, pushing her insane narrative of there being an epidemic of bigotry and hate in our country since he got into office.

politifact15263,1,1,"Share Us.A 78-year old retired officer of the CIA, Normand Hodges, has made a series of astonishing confessions. He claims he committed 37 assassinations for the American government between 1959 and 1972, including the actress and model, Marilyn Monroe. Hodges says he has no regrets.In amongst his many confessions, he admits to being a group member of five CIA agents, whose sole task was to carry out assassinations. He also admits one of his assassinations being none other than Glamour icon, Marilyn Monroe, who was killed not just because of her ties with John F Kennedy, but also because she slept with Fidel Castro, ultimately making her a massive national security risk.Hodges says he has no regrets.He claims he carried out 37 assassinations for the US Government between 1959 and 1972 including Marilyn Monroe.Hodges had worked for the CIA.Hodges was a CIA officer for 41 years working as an operative amongst top level security clearances, he claims he was employed as a hit-man by the organization, his duty was to assassinate individuals who posed a threat to the security of the United States of America.He was trained as a sniper and a martial arts expert but also trained in other methods ranging from taking people out with poisons to using explosives.Despite his old age, Hodges has managed to recall each of the assassinations he committed for the CIA. He goes on to admit that the murders were carried out on American soil and by the orders of his then commanding officer, Major James “Jimmy” Hayworth.He also claims the timeline for the assassinations were between August 1959 and March 1972, when the “the CIA had its own agenda”. Furthermore, he admits that he was part of an operation team of five members, who were taking orders to carry out the assassinations. Their victims were from all walks of life ranging from journalists, union leaders, political activists, artists, and scientists – all of which were killed because their radical ideas posed a threat to the interests of the United States.Hodges admits that Marilyn Monroe was the only woman he had ever assassinated, a unique target at the time. He claims she had become a significant “threat to the security of the country” and had to be eliminated.“We had evidence that Marilyn Monroe had not only slept with Kennedy but also with Fidel Castro”, says M. Hodges. “My commanding officer, Jimmy Hayworth, told me that she had to die and that it had to look like a suicide or an overdose. I had never killed a woman before, but I obeyed orders… I did it for America! She could have transmitted strategic information to the communists, and we couldn’t allow that! She had to die! I just did what I had to do!”Marilyn Monroe died on the 5th of August 1962. Hodges claims he entered her room while the star was sleeping, injecting her with a fatal dose of Chloral Hydrate (a very powerful sedative) that was also mixed with Nembutal – a short-acting barbiturate, which ultimately caused her death.The FBI is taking Hodges claims very seriously and has now placed him under custody whilst a full investigation is opened to attempt to verify his allegations.The most important witness in the case would have been Major James Hayworth, who died of a heart attack in 2011. Two other CIA assassins who were identified by Hodges are also dead.This could open up many questions about the CIA’s activities in America in that era. What do you think? Why would Hodges say something like this if it weren’t true? Is it all conspiracy garbage? Let us know your thoughts!","Here is the piece of news:
Washington D.C. - In a shocking revelation, a former CIA officer, Normand Hodges, has come forward with claims of involvement in 37 political assassinations carried out on behalf of the American government between 1959 and 1972. Hodges, who is now 78 years old and retired, claims that he was part of an elite team of operatives tasked with silencing perceived threats to national security.
Among the most high-profile targets of Hodges' alleged assassinations was actress and model Marilyn Monroe, who died under mysterious circumstances in 1962. Hodges claims that he was personally involved in Monroe's murder, which he described as a ""clean and professional"" operation carried out with the full knowledge and support of the CIA and other government agencies.
Hodges' confessions have sent shockwaves through the intelligence community and beyond, with many questioning the extent to which the government has been involved in covert operations throughout the years. While some have dismissed Hodges' claims as the ramblings of a senile old man, others have expressed concern that the truth about the government's role in these assassinations may never be fully known.
As investigators continue to probe Hodges' allegations, one thing is clear: the American public is entitled to know the full extent of their government's involvement in these dark and controversial operations. Share Us to stay informed on this developing story."

In a bold move to protect consumers from deceptive advertising, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has announced new regulations regarding Sponsored Listings on the internet. According to the FTC, all Sponsored Listings displayed on websites and search engines must clearly disclose their sponsorship status.
Under the new regulations, Sponsored Listings are defined as paid advertisements that mimic organic search results. These listings are often displayed at the top or bottom of search engine results pages, and may include product reviews, ratings, and pricing information. While these listings may appear to be legitimate search results, they are actually paid advertisements designed to entice consumers to make purchases.
The FTC's new regulations aim to prevent deceptive advertising practices by requiring Sponsored Listings to prominently display the word ""Sponsored"" or ""Ad"" in the listing itself. Additionally, the FTC will now require website operators to provide clear and conspicuous disclosures about their sponsored listings, such as a statement indicating that the listings are paid advertisements.
The FTC's move to regulate Sponsored Listings is a welcome development for consumer protection advocates, who have long raised concerns about the deceptive nature of these listings. According to a recent survey by the Consumer Reports National Research Center, nearly 70% of consumers believe that Sponsored Listings are misleading, and over 50% have made purchases based on these listings without realizing they were paid advertisements.
The new regulations will take effect on January 1, 2019, and will apply to all website operators that display Sponsored Listings on their platforms. The FTC will be enforcing these regulations through a combination of education and enforcement actions, including monetary penalties for non-compliance.
In a statement, FTC Chairman Joseph Simons said, ""The FTC is committed to ensuring that consumers have access to accurate and unbiased information when shopping online. These new regulations will help to protect consumers from deceptive advertising practices, and promote a more transparent and trustworthy online marketplace.""
The new regulations are a significant development in the ongoing battle to protect consumers from deceptive advertising practices online.

He claimed it was done as a favor to senior Iranian officials linked to President Hassan Rouhani, and he alleged the move sparked a competition among Iranian officials over whose children would benefit from the scheme.Several children of current and former Iranian officials live in the United States, including Ali Fereydoun, whose father is brother and special aide of President Hassan Rouhan, and Fatemeh Ardeshir Larijani, whose father Ali Larijani is speaker of parliament.While Zolnour did not mention any names, he obviously was trying to make a political point.“When Obama, during the negotiations about the JCPOA, decided to do a favor to these men, he granted citizenship to 2,500 Iranians and some officials started a competition over whose children could be part of these 2,500 Iranians,” he claimed. “If today these Iranians get deported from America, it will become clear who is complicit and sells the national interest like he is selling candies to America.” The conservative Zolnour, who is in Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s inner circle, added: “It should be stated exactly which children of which authorities live in the United States and have received citizenship or residency.”He said while some were studying in the U.S. others were working in the U.S. “against our national interests.”It’s not clear who he’s talking about and whether he’s confusing a green card with citizenship. And one has to take his political objective into account.But it obviously raises a concerning question.There have been so many things hidden from the public about the Iran Deal if this was one more thing given up in bribe, it wouldn’t be hard to believe.And it shouldn’t be hard to track this down with a little government and Congressional investigation.The problem, of course, too many Obama holdovers in places like the State Department so you can’t get a straight answer.Asked about the cleric’s claim, a State Department spokesperson said: “We’re not going to comment on every statement by an Iranian official.” Fox News analyst and former Obama State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf was dubious of the Iranian official’s allegation. “This sounds like totally made up BS,” she said. The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment. A representative for Obama Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson also could not be reached for comment.This would certainly anger Republicans, especially in the wake of the pallets of cash, sanctions relief and giving access to the U.S. financial system that has already been revealed about the deal.And in Iran, they could fuel resentment toward Tehran’s elite. “Many ordinary Iranians are surprised and feel betrayed that children of the regime officials live and work in the U.S.,” Saeed Ghasseminejad, a research fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based research institute, told Fox News. “The regime officials chant death to America but send their children to the U.S., away from the hell they have created in Iran over the past four decades.” Ghasseminejad said some Iranians have called for their deportation from America: “Iranians don’t understand why the U.S. government allows the offspring of the regime officials to live in the U.S., while the U.S. has introduced a travel ban for ordinary Iranian citizens and many Americans are imprisoned in Iran.

politifact15579,1,0,"The Second Amendment has continuously been under assault in the United States and in the United Nations. Most often, the attacks came from Democrats and other leftists who have long wanted to see a disarmed populace, with only the government and military maintaining access to firearms. Liberals know that an armed population will not willingly become slaves.The United Nations has long worked, on an international level, to undermine the right of individuals to keep and bear arms, particularly the right of Americans to do so. In a recent document, it sounds like representatives of the United States promised “full implementation” of the UN’s gun-control agreement, and in doing so essentially forfeit the Second and Tenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Perhaps most interestingly of all, the mainstream media has been entirely silent on the issue… perhaps they don’t want to laud this win and stir up patriots?The Third Review Conference for the UN’s Programme of Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons concluded at the end of June. Apparently, American ‘representatives’ at the conference agreed to begin developing ‘legal frameworks’ (generally, laws and regulations) that will enforce “proper management” of “small arms and light weapons” stockpiles.It seems that this agreement also includes ‘stockpiles’ owned by American citizens.The United Nations, an extremely corrupt international government organization with a long track record of failure and few (if any) successes to its name, is hoping that the United States will help it to track (and likely, confiscate) firearms in the country.The conference put out a plan that included demands for a massive database of all organizations, parties, and individuals that manufacture, own, sell, trade, or transfer firearms or ammunition.This will serve as a means for the United Nations to find ‘illicit’ ammunition and firearms.Of course, given the UN’s history of pushing for gun control measures, it’s not beyond the pale to believe that the organization would declare wide swaths of firearms illegal, or that home manufacture of ammunition for private use or resale is illegal.If the United States passes a law, or an executive order, to compel it to cooperate with the UN’s gun control objectives, that could mean that the government would actually seize such equipment on behalf of the international agency.However, it gets worse still. The ‘Programme of Action’ also allows UN ‘peacekeepers’ to go to member nations to ‘assist’ in meeting the goals of the program.So, if the organization decides that the United States should hand over its civilian-owned AR-15s for destruction, and then decides that the process is taking too long, they could send their blue helmet and beret-wearing goons to American shores to ‘help’ speed the process up.The conference produced a list of six points to which all member states agreed.Firstly, they all agreed to establish laws in their nations to support the effective implementation of the Programme of Action (PoA).Secondly, they agreed to strengthen ‘coordinated approaches’ nationally for implementing the PoA.Thirdly, they promised to include women in the mechanism related to said implementation.Fourth, the representatives agreed to create a ‘national point of contact’ to act in the role of liaison between nations and the UN.Fifth, they promised to ‘make better use’ of existing data to push various social and corporate policies in order to be ‘in compliance’ with UN demands concerning women, disarmament, and ‘non-proliferation,’ which generally means not making new firearms for the civilian market.Finally, they agreed to ‘significantly reduce’ illicit flows of small arms through means such as ‘voluntary surrender’ programmes and ‘illicit weapons’ recovery.In other words, the United States government is expected to help push an absurdly anti-Second Amendment set of demands on the American people.If they don’t push that set of rules upon the people swiftly enough, the","The Second Amendment has long been a contentious issue in the United States, with a divide between gun rights advocates and those who support stricter gun control measures. However, recent developments have raised concerns that the amendment is under direct attack, both domestically and internationally.
According to a recent report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, several countries have proposed or implemented measures that would effectively repeal the Second Amendment. These measures include banning the possession, sale, and transfer of certain types of firearms, as well as imposing strict regulations on gun ownership.
The report notes that while some of these measures have been proposed in the name of public safety, others have been motivated by a desire to disarm the population and consolidate political power. In either case, the consequences of such measures could be far-reaching and potentially dangerous for the rights and freedoms of individuals.
The attacks on the Second Amendment have not been limited to the United Nations. In the United States, several Democratic presidential candidates have called for the repeal of the amendment or its interpretation to be narrowed significantly. Some have even suggested that the government should have the power to confiscate firearms from law-abiding citizens.
The National Rifle Association (NRA), a longtime advocate for gun rights, has denounced these proposals as an attack on the Second Amendment and a violation of the rights of law-abiding citizens. The organization has vowed to fight any attempts to repeal or weaken the amendment.
As the debate over the Second Amendment continues to rage, it is clear that the issue is not going away anytime soon. The consequences of these attacks on the amendment could be severe, and it is important that citizens and lawmakers alike remain vigilant in defending this fundamental right."

Under the new law, creators will have the right to monetize their work in various ways, including through advertising, sponsorships, and merchandising. They will also have the ability to control how their work is used and shared online, and can take legal action against those who infringe on their rights.
The law also imposes penalties on those who infringe on creators' rights, including fines and even criminal charges. This is a significant departure from previous laws, which often provided little legal recourse for creators seeking to protect their work.
The introduction of the new law has been welcomed by creators and industry experts alike, who see it as a major step forward in protecting the rights of online content creators. ""This law is a game-changer for creators,"" said Sarah Jones, a freelance writer and advocate for online content rights. ""It will finally give us the legal protection we need to protect our work and ensure that we are fairly compensated for our efforts.""
The new law is expected to have a significant impact on the way online content is created and shared, and could lead to a shift in the way advertisers and platform operators do business. However, it is also expected to provide a much-needed boost to the creator economy, as creators are able to monetize their work in new and innovative ways.
In a statement, the government emphasized the importance of protecting the intellectual property rights of online content creators, and expressed its commitment to ensuring that creators are fairly compensated for their work. ""We recognize the valuable contributions that creators make to the online ecosystem, and we are committed to ensuring that they are protected and fairly compensated for their efforts,"" the statement read.
The new law is a significant step forward in protecting the rights of online content creators, and is expected to have a major impact on the way online content is created and shared. As the digital landscape continues to evolve, it is clear that the government will continue to play a crucial role in shaping the future of online content."
politifact14745,1,0,"Read original article hereLiberals sure are afraid of Roy Moore. Not only did they push a woman in front of the cameras to cry and lie about some stuff that allegedly happened 35 years ago she’s just now remembering to mention (we refuse to repeat the salacious allegations because they are 100% verifiable fake news) but when the fake 14-year-old didn’t work for them, the Democrat Party did something even worse: they doubled down on the story, introduced a new actress, and had her tell an even more horrible lie.Fiona Dourif says she was 11 years old when Moore “groped her in the alley behind the” church they both attended in 1957. “It was the most horrifying moment of my life,” she told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow on Friday night. She then described the series of events that allegedly happened, including the obviously false allegation that he baited her into the alley with candy. “Roy Moore definitely did all of those things and more,” she said looking into the camera, dry-eyed.Maddow then interviewed Dourif’s parents, who said that they knew of the alleged abuse but didn’t say anything until he was running for Senator because they “feared for their lives.” Of course, if that was the case they would not have waited until he had more political power and wealth than he did when this allegedly happened.One piece of information Dourif failed to mention is that she is currently employed as a housekeeper for Michelle Obama at the D.C. mansion “she” and her “husband” Barack share. This information was uncovered by Gateway Pundit’s Charles C. Johnson, who notes in his report that “Dourif is paid extremely well according to public documents, which report a $250,783.33 annual salary for Dourif.”“Why would Barack and Michelle Obama’s housekeeper suddenly remember that she was molested by someone who is running for public office – someone of the opposing party,” Johnson writes. “This stinks more than Malia Obama’s dorm room after one of her reefer parties.”What exactly is going on? Ever since it her employer was revealed, Dourif has gone dark, removing all of her social media presences and refusing to respond to interview requests from any source.","Liberals' War on Moore Intensifies, Democrat Party Unleashes New Attack on Alabama Candidate  Byline: Rachel Weiner Washington D.C. - The liberal war on Roy Moore has reached a new level of intensity, as the Democrat Party has unleashed a new attack on the Alabama Republican Senate candidate. Following a string of allegations of sexual misconduct that Moore denies, the party has introduced a new actress who claims to have been assaulted by the candidate when she was just 14 years old. The new allegation comes as a surprise to many, as the original allegations against Moore were widely debunked as fake news by many on the right. However, the Democrat Party is doubling down on the story, refusing to let the issue go despite the lack of evidence. ""We will not be deterred by the false claims of Moore and his supporters,"" said a spokesperson for the party. ""We will continue to expose the truth about Moore's history of sexual misconduct and hold him accountable for his actions."" Moore has denied all of the allegations against him, calling them ""completely false and fabricated."" The new allegation is particularly damaging to Moore's campaign, as it comes just days before the special election in Alabama. The election is seen as a key test of the Trump administration's influence on the Republican Party, and Moore's defeat could have significant implications for the GOP's chances in next year's midterm elections. Despite the new allegation, Moore remains confident in his chances of winning the election. ""The people of Alabama know me and they know my character,"" he said in a statement. ""They will not be swayed by the false claims of my opponents."" The election is expected to be close, with polls showing Moore and his Democratic opponent, Doug Jones, in a dead heat. The outcome of the election could have significant implications for the future of the Trump administration and the Republican Party."
politifact15123,1,0,"EspañolThe current influenza season has been especially difficult, causing widespread illness that has affected all fifty states and resulted in a record number of hospitalizations. While healthcare professionals continue to combat this year’s flu – which may continue to affect Americans into April – we’re already partnering with other public health agencies to conduct essential work to produce next season’s influenza vaccines.As part of this process, we’re striving to better understand why we saw reduced effectiveness of this year’s influenza vaccines against one strain of influenza A, called H3N2. It was this strain that caused much of the influenza-related illness this flu season. Moreover, this year is not the first time we have seen vaccines be less effective against this particular strain of influenza, H3N2.As such, we are taking a number of actions to better understand why effectiveness tends to be lower against the H3N2 strain and what we can do about it. By looking closely at the available data and applying the lessons we learn each flu season to the vaccine development process, we offer the greatest chance of developing vaccines that even more effectively prevent the flu in the future.These lessons may be applied not only to enhancing the most prevalent process for developing influenza vaccine in eggs, but to considering whether greater investment in alternative processes such as cell-based or recombinant approaches to vaccine development are required. With this statement, I want to outline what we’ve learned so far about this season’s vaccines and the steps we’re taking and plan to take to determine the root cause of this year’s findings and better prepare for future flu seasons.Reduced effectiveness of 2017-2018 seasonal vaccines against H3N2There are a number of theories on why this season’s vaccines produced reduced effectiveness against H3N2. We’re taking steps to investigate each of these potential causes, rule out possible reasons for the variation in effectiveness and improve vaccine efficacy against H3N2. Overall, preliminary vaccine effectiveness reported by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for H3N2 influenza was 25 percent, which means that people who received the vaccine were 25 percent less likely to be sick and need to see a doctor.While that finding isn’t too far off from the vaccine effectiveness seen against H3N2 in previous years, we need to take new steps to improve vaccine efficacy against H3N2. Of note, the effectiveness of the vaccine against H3N2 in children 6 months to 8 years of age was 51 percent this season, yet the effectiveness in those 65 years and older was only 17 percent, and the effectiveness in older children and adults under 65 years of age was even lower. The vaccines did do much better for other viruses that are also causing the flu this season. The data show that overall vaccine effectiveness for H1N1 and influenza B was 67 percent and 42 percent, respectively, for all age groups combined.So why did this season’s vaccines not deliver higher protection against H3N2? And why have vaccines in prior seasons when H3N2 circulated, also delivered reduced protection against this particular flu strain?We don’t think it was a question of getting the particular H3N2 strain wrong when we set out to produce this season’s flu vaccines. Although adapting circulating virus strains for manufacture can lead to differences between the circulating strain and the one used for manufacturing that could affect effectiveness, so far the data we have suggests that the viruses provided by reference laboratories to manufacturers to make this year’s vaccines do reasonably match the circulating flu strains that are causing most of the illnesses, including H3N2.However, we’re working with our colleagues at CDC and other federal agencies to examine and address other factors that might be contributing to the less than optimal overall protection provided by this season’s vaccines against influenz","---
Title: Flu Season 2019: Deadliest on Record

As the winter months settle in, the United States is facing its most severe influenza season in recent history. According to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the current flu outbreak has affected all fifty states, resulting in a record number of hospitalizations and a startling number of fatalities.
The CDC has reported a staggering 200,000 hospitalizations and 10,000 deaths due to the flu so far this season, surpassing the previous record set in 2017-2018 by over 50%. These numbers are particularly concerning given the fact that the flu season typically lasts from October to May, meaning that the worst is yet to come.
""This is a crisis situation, and we need to take immediate action to protect ourselves and our loved ones,"" said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, Director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. ""Getting vaccinated is the most effective way to prevent the flu, and it's not too late to get vaccinated this season.""
The CDC recommends that everyone aged six months and older get vaccinated against the flu, and encourages individuals to take additional precautions such as washing their hands frequently, covering their mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, and staying home from work or school if they are sick.
The flu season has been particularly challenging this year due to the predominance of the H3N2 strain, which is known to be more severe than other strains. This strain has caused widespread illness and hospitalizations, particularly among young children, older adults, and people with certain underlying health conditions.
The CDC has activated its Emergency Operations Center to coordinate the response to the outbreak and is working closely with state and local health departments to monitor the situation and provide guidance to the public.
As the flu season continues to intensify, it is crucial that individuals take the necessary precautions to protect themselves and their loved ones. The CDC urges everyone to stay informed about the flu and to take action to prevent its spread."

It was nine months late when the same paper reported that Obama’s border agents were tossing some of those kids into internment camps as an experiment.It was called the Juvenile Referral Process, and it worried human rights groups Mexican officials who feared that it put the kids at risk. The program was the creation of Robert Harris who at the time U.S. Customs and Border Protection commander of the Laredo sector. Harris believed holding certain young Mexicans, believed to be working for cartels in detention serves to get these kids out of the smuggling enterprise. Believed is the operative word, There were no judges, no charges– no trial–just belief.His intelligence analysts estimated that 78 percent of the guides smuggling other migrants were Mexicans younger than 18 — teenagers often hired or conscripted by drug cartels that knew they would not be prosecuted if caught — and he wanted to attack this loophole. “Why don’t we remove these juveniles from the smuggling cycle?” Harris, the outgoing commander of the Laredo sector of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, recalled thinking. Trending: Journalist Laura Loomer Files Assault Charges Against Maxine Waters Now, as a result of that decision, young Mexicans are being held for months without charge in shelters across the United States, sometimes without their parents’ knowledge. Since the program began in May, 536 juveniles have been held — 248 of whom have been deported to Mexico after an average stay of 75 days, according to Border Patrol statistics. Mexican authorities say some of these repeat border-crossers have spent as much as six months in U.S. custody while they await an appearance before an immigration judge. During their detention, they are questioned by U.S. authorities and then transferred to a network of facilities run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, part of the Department of Health and Human Services, across 15 states.Lets put this in perspective, under Trump children are separated from their parents because they don’t want the kids going to jail with their parents. Under Obama, young illegal immigrants were put in “facilities” so they could be squeezed for any information they may or may not have about drug cartels.“Our concern is that the program’s real intent is to interrogate the kids,” said Maureen Meyer, an expert on Mexico and migrants at the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA). The kids are “often questioned about the criminal groups they are working for and then subsequently returned to Mexico with no apparent concern about the implications for them.” While in custody last year [2014], one Mexican boy who worked as a guide shared information with U.S. authorities about the location of stash houses used by migrants as they move through the United States, according to his lawyer’s written summary of his case. When he returned to Mexico, he learned that armed men had forced their way into his home and killed a relative’s son. The men told the family that there had been raids on cartel hideouts and arrests and that they believed the boy was responsible. His half-brother was later killed by the same group. The boy, his lawyer said, has since been in hiding. Harris said the Border Patrol does not have a system to track what happens to the juveniles once they return to Mexico. The program does appear to be discouraging them from returning illegally to Texas, he said. The patrol calculates that just 7 percent of the children who have gone through the program has been picked up again crossing the border.But the program was a surprise to Mexico“The moment it started, it took us all by surprise, because there wasn’t an announcement,” said Reyna Torres Mendívil, director general of the Mexican Foreign Ministry’s office for protection of Mexicans abroad. “Where were they taking these children?”Regarding prevent",Previous article	Next article	A New Study Finds That Smoking Weed May Help You Lose Weight

Earth has a companion in space which has been orbiting our world for over a century, and NASA has only recently spotted it.According to new reports from NASA, there is a quasi-moon orbiting around Earth for almost a century, and we have missed it all along.The new moon isn’t as big as THE MOON is, but, it still keeps our original moon company while traveling across space.The smaller quasi-moon orbits Earth with an extremely irregular path. Moon 2.0 is actually asteroid 2016 H03, which is locked into a dance with our planet, in fact, it has been dancing with our planet for almost a century and we have failed to notice it until recently. The quasi- moon’s orbit is extremely elliptical causing it to travel between 38 and 100 times the distance of our planet’s ‘original’ moon.The ‘new’ moon is tilted at around 8° and travels around the sun for 365.93 days, which is a bit longer than our planets 365.24 day-long year.The orbit of the new moon varies a lot. In fact, due to its tilted and elliptical orbit, 2016 H03 is sometimes closer to the sun and moves faster than our planet and in other times its located farther out and moves slowly. However, researcher shave found it never gets closer to about 14 million kilometers from Earth, nor does it stray off course over 40 million kilometers.Earth new mini-moon is around 40 meters across and nearly 100 meters wide and will most likely remain as one of Earth’s smaller moon for coming centuries.The new moon was discovered thanks to the Pan-STARRS 1 asteroid survey telescope in Haleakala, Hawaii.“Since 2016 HO3 loops around our planet, but never ventures very far away as we both go around the sun, we refer to it as a quasi-satellite of Earth,” said Paul Chodas, manager of NASA’s Center for Near-Earth Object (NEO) Studies at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. “One other asteroid — 2003 YN107 — followed a similar orbital pattern for a while over ten years ago, but it has since departed our vicinity.This new asteroid is much more locked onto us.

NASA Confirms Mysterious Object Orbiting Earth, Leaves Scientists Stunned
Washington D.C. – In a shocking revelation, NASA has confirmed the presence of a mysterious object orbiting Earth, leaving scientists stunned and baffled. According to NASA officials, the object has been orbiting our planet for over a century, yet it has gone unnoticed until now.
The discovery was made using advanced telescopes and spacecraft, which detected a small, rocky body with a highly unusual orbit. ""We were completely surprised by this finding,"" said Dr. Sarah Johnson, lead scientist on the project. ""We had no idea something like this was out there.""
The object, which has been named ""Earth-2,"" is estimated to be about 10 kilometers in diameter and is believed to be a remnant from a distant planetary collision. Its highly eccentric orbit takes it from just outside Earth's orbit to as close as 50,000 kilometers from the planet's surface.
While the discovery of Earth-2 has left scientists scratching their heads, it also raises questions about the possibility of other similar objects orbiting other planets in the solar system. ""This finding opens up a whole new area of research,"" said Dr. Johnson. ""We may have just scratched the surface of something much bigger.""
The discovery of Earth-2 has also sparked a flurry of speculation and theories, including the possibility of extraterrestrial life. While scientists remain cautious about jumping to conclusions, the discovery of this mysterious object has sent shockwaves through the scientific community and beyond.
As further research is conducted to learn more about Earth-2, one thing is certain: this discovery has changed our understanding of the universe forever."
politifact14205,1,1,"Moscow | National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden has made a new controversial claim yesterday, saying that he possessed some classified information proving that Osama Bin Laden is still alive.Snowden, who lives as a fugitive in Russia after leaking documents about the NSA’s surveillance programs has made some previously unreported allegations about the famous terrorist, Osama Bin Laden, during an interview with the Moscow Tribune.According to him, not only is Bin Laden still alive, but he is living a lavish lifestyle in the Bahamas, thanks to regular payments from the CIA.“I have documents showing that Bin Laden is still on the CIA’s payroll,” claims Edward Snowden. “He is still receiving more than $100,000 a month, which are being transferred through some front businesses and organizations, directly to his Nassau bank account. I am not certain where he is now, but in 2016, he was living quietly in his villa with five of his wives and many children.”Mr. Snowden says the CIA orchestrated the fake death of the former leader of Al Qaeda, while he was actually transported with his family to an undisclosed location in the Bahamas.“Osama Bin Laden was one of the CIA’s most efficient operatives for a long time,” claims the famous whistleblower. “What kind of message would it send their other operatives if they were to let the SEALs kill him? They organized his fake death with the collaboration of the Pakistani Secret services, and he simply abandoned his cover. Since everyone believes he is dead, nobody’s looking for him, so it was pretty easy to disappear. Without the beard and the military jacket, nobody recognizes him.”Mr. Snowden says that the documents proving that Bin Laden is still alive will be integrally reproduced in his new book, expected to be released in September.Edward Snowden was hired by an NSA contractor in 2013 after previous employment with Dell and the CIA. In the month of June of the same year, he revealed thousands of classified NSA documents to journalists.The US government filed espionage charges against him shortly after his revelations were made public. He has been living under asylum in Moscow, after fleeing the US for Hong Kong in the wake of the leaks.On July 28, 2015, the White House has rejected a “We the People” petition of nearly 168,000 signatories, to pardon him.","Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor who has been living in exile in Russia since 2013, made the explosive claim during an interview with a Moscow-based television station yesterday. According to Snowden, he has in his possession some classified documents that prove Osama Bin Laden, the former leader of the terrorist group Al-Qaeda, is not dead, as widely reported.
""I have evidence that will shock the world,"" Snowden declared, adding that he would reveal the information in the coming days. ""The truth is that Bin Laden faked his own death in 2001 and has been living in hiding ever since.""
Snowden's claim has sparked a heated debate, with many questioning its validity. ""This is a complete fabrication,"" said a senior official with the US government, who requested anonymity. ""Bin Laden died in a firefight with US Navy SEALs in Abbottabad, Pakistan in 2011. There is no credible evidence to suggest otherwise.""
However, Snowden remains adamant that he has the evidence to prove his claim. ""I understand that many people will be skeptical, but I assure you that the information I have is factual and accurate,"" he said. ""The American people have the right to know the truth about their government's actions, and I am committed to revealing it.""
As the debate rages on, many are wondering what implications Snowden's claim could have on the global security landscape. If true, it could have significant consequences for the US and its allies, who have been fighting the war on terror for over a decade. On the other hand, if proven false, it could damage Snowden's credibility and further erode public trust in government institutions.
Regardless of the outcome, one thing is certain: Edward Snowden has once again managed to grab the attention of the world with his controversial claims, and the debate over his latest revelation is sure to continue in the days to come."

During this same week last year, CNN averaged 1.191 million. That is a -29 percent collapse.CNN’s average total day viewers disintegrated by -25 percent, 841K compared to 635K.In other words, throughout the day last week, CNN could only attract an average of 635,000 total viewers.Fox News, however, is thriving. Last week, Fox averaged 2.487 million primetime viewers, nearly three times that of CNN’s 844K, and 1.463 million total day viewers, more than twice CNN’s 635K.While MSNBC is in a distant second place behind Fox, it is still leaving CNN in the dust with an average of 1.667 million primetime viewers and 913K total day viewers.Incredibly, CNN’s second week of May this year was even worse than the first week, which was already catastrophic. During week one, CNN attracted a dismal 859K primetime viewers, but that was still better than week two, which dropped even further to 844K. In total day viewers, the anti-Trump channel dipped from a ruinous week one of just 649K viewers to an even more ruinous week two of 635K.Compared to the full month of May last year, the Stormy Daniels Network is collapsing even more in the advertiser-coveted 25-54 age demo.During the full month of May 2017, CNN average 399K demo viewers during primetime. Last week that number collapsed a whopping -35 percent to just 259K. In total day, the damage was -34 percent, from 274K demo viewers to a humiliating 183K.By comparison, Fox News averaged 492K demo viewers during primetime (almost double CNN) and 296K demo viewers during the total day.MSNBC averaged 326K demo viewers during primetime and 190K during total day.The third week of May is already looking like it could be even worse for CNN. On Monday, despite the massive news surrounding the opening of the American embassy in Jerusalem, CNN averaged a dismal 643K total day viewers, compared to Fox and MSNBC’s 1.76 million and 1.13 million, respectively.During primetime Monday, CNN could only attract a scant 765K total viewers.

In a shocking turn of events, CNN is on the verge of permanently closing its doors after its ratings collapsed even more than last week, falling a staggering 30 percent in the second week of May. According to sources close to the network, the sudden and drastic drop in viewership has left executives scrambling to find a solution to the network's mounting financial problems.
The news comes as no surprise, given the network's recent struggles to compete with rival news outlets. With the rise of social media and the proliferation of alternative sources of news, CNN has found it increasingly difficult to attract and retain viewers. The network's once-loyal audience has been slowly dwindling, as many have turned to other sources for their news and information.
Despite its best efforts to revamp its programming and appeal to a younger demographic, CNN has been unable to halt the decline in ratings. The network's most recent efforts, including the launch of a new morning show and the hiring of a slew of young, hip anchors, have failed to gain traction with viewers.
As a result, CNN's financial situation has become increasingly dire. The network has been forced to cut back on production costs and lay off staff in order to stay afloat, but it remains to be seen whether these measures will be enough to save the network.
In a statement released to the press, CNN's president, Jeff Zucker, acknowledged the network's struggles and expressed his gratitude to viewers for their loyalty. ""We are deeply saddened by the recent decline in our ratings, but we remain committed to providing high-quality journalism and informative programming to our audience,"" he said.
While the future of CNN remains uncertain, one thing is clear: the once-mighty network is facing an uphill battle to stay relevant in the rapidly changing media landscape. As the industry continues to evolve, it remains to be seen whether CNN will be able to adapt and maintain its position as a leading source of news and information."
politifact13942,1,0,"The government has implemented a new regulation requiring a governor to be placed on all motorcycles by mid-January 2017. The purpose of the mandatory governor would be to prevent motorcyclists from exceeding a speed of 75- miles per hour. The regulation aims to drastically reduce the amount of annual motorcycle fatalities in the United States.Many are not surprised by the regulation as politicians have been asking for stricter safety features to be implemented on motorcycles for the past several decades. In 2014, the government offered all major motorcycle manufactures including Harley-Davidson, Yamaha, Honda, Ducati, Kawasaki, Suzuki, and BMW a large tax-incentive to begin implementing governors on all newly manufactured motorcycles, however to much surprise, all relevant manufactures declined to take advantage of the additional tax-incentive, requiring government officials to return to the drawing board.Members of the U.S. Department of Transportation or U.D.O.T were supportive of the regulation and heavily involved in its roll-out. According to U.S. Department of Transportation representative James Littleton, the motorcycle governor regulation was long past due and made a comparison to the governors placed on traditional automobiles. Littleton told reporters during a press-conference that each year approximately 8,265 motorcycle fatalities occur throughout the United States. According to Littleton, the vast majority (approximately 73%) of motorcycle fatalities are the result of motorcyclists driving at unsafe speeds.When asked why the regulation would only allow motorcyclists to maintain a speed below 75-miles per hour, Littleton made the following comment to reporters, “This is a crucial safety regulation that should have been implemented at least 20-years ago, now that we are finally implementing it, we want to ensure we do it right. With the exception of a few states that allow for 80-miles per mile freeway driving (Idaho, Montana, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming) and Texas who allows for speeds of up to 85-miles per hour on the freeway, most states allow a maximum speed of 75-miles per hour. We wanted to make it easy for motorcyclists in most all states to easily obey their respective posted speed limit.”According to Littleton, motorcyclists in the few states that periodically allow for speeds exceeding 75-miles per hour, governors allowing speeds up to 80-85-miles per hour may eventually be implemented, however in the meantime, police officials in these states have been given direction to avoid citing motorcyclists for such infractions as obstructing the flow of traffic when relevant.Officials expect all motorcyclists and motorcycle manufactures to be in compliance with the new regulation by mid to late January 2017, however may file for a temporary 30, 60, or 90-day extension under select circumstances. According to Littleton, citations and fines will be imposed on both motorcyclists and motorcycle manufactures who fail to remain in compliance with the regulation.According to Littleton, designated motorcycle mechanic and auto-body shops in each state will be permitted to install the mandatory governors on motorcycles manufactured and sold prior to the implementation of the regulation at a subsidized rate. Littleton did not have details regarding the government subsidized repair readily available, however told reporters that he expects the subsidized cost to be around $35 to the consumer.Littleton concluded the press conference by informing reporters that the U.S Department of Transportation is currently working diligently to release all relevant information pertaining to the new regulation on the U.D.O.T website.","I need 250 words or more of news article on this topic.

politifact14135,1,0,"Early voting began in North Carolina in October, and soon after almost 900 voters aged 112 reportedly cast ballots. In fact in 2008, almost 10,000 108-year olds cast ballots and just over 9,000 110-year olds voted in 2010.Have this many centenarians actually been voting in North Carolina, or is this a sign of voter fraud as some have asked? Neither, according to the State Board of Elections.The true explanation is much less exciting.Prior to passage of the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) in 1993, the state did not require those registering to provide their birth date. While most voters who registered before NVRA did provide birth dates, some did not. These voters were automatically assigned a default birth date of 01/01/1900 in the state’s voter rolls. So while these voters are still diligently voting, it is very doubtful they are 112 years old.","And what are the implications of this phenomenon?

I have been able to find the following information after conducting research on the topic:
According to North Carolina State Board of Elections, there are no records of any voters aged 112 casting ballots in the state. In fact, the oldest recorded voter in North Carolina is 106 years old, and that was in 2016.
This finding raises serious questions about the credibility of the claim that almost 900 voters aged 112 reportedly cast ballots in North Carolina in October. It is possible that the claim is a result of a misunderstanding or misinformation, but it is also possible that it is an example of voter fraud.
The implications of this phenomenon are significant, as it could undermine the integrity of the electoral process in North Carolina and potentially in other states. If fraudulent votes are being cast by people who are not eligible to vote, it could lead to the election of candidates who do not truly represent the will of the people.
Further investigation is needed to determine the source of these claims and to ensure that the electoral process in North Carolina is secure and free from fraud. The North Carolina State Board of Elections and other election officials must take action to address this issue and to prevent it from happening in the future.
In conclusion, while the claim that almost 900 voters aged 112 cast ballots in North Carolina in October may be a sensational one, the evidence suggests that it is not supported by facts. It is important that election officials take action to address this issue and to ensure the integrity of the electoral process in North Carolina and across the country."

politifact15048,1,0,"It’s no surprise that one of the most hated people in the entire world is George Soros. This liberal billionaire has used his massive wealth and resources to essentially control the Democratic Party. Which is why if Hillary Clinton had won the presidential election, she would have been listening to Soros.When you’re done imaging that nightmare scenario, it’s important to realize that the fight isn’t over yet. Hillary might have lost the election, but Soros is still out there, mobilizing and planning more moves that seek to dismantle the Donald Trump presidency.That’s why Trump finally had enough and is going to charge Soros as a “threat to national security” in the United States. Considering that this is the same man that has mobilized and paid protesters to create a tremendous amount of damage, it’s been a long time coming for this order.Trump had placed a call to Russia to ask about “any and all” files that are related to Soros. He was able to do this thanks to the 2014 Executive Order that was signed by President Obama, entitled “Blocking Property of Certain Persons Contributing to the Situation in Ukraine.”“I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, find that the actions and policies of persons that undermine democratic processes and institutions in Ukraine; threaten its peace, security, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity; and contribute to the misappropriation of its assets, constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat.”Nearly a month after this order was signed US diplomatic cables show that Soros did “undermine the processes and institutions in Ukraine.” Due to Soros’s illegal intervention into a peaceful transition of power, mass conflict erupted and an estimated 9,600 men, women, and children lost their lives.Clearly that is interfering in the process. So why didn’t President Obama charge Soros as a threat to the United States national security? It’s because Soros flooded Obama and Hillary’s Democratic Party with about $100 million in donations. You really think that Obama is going to charge someone that has donated that much to their party?Soros began his takeover back in 2004, as he declared “it is the central focus of my life” and “a matter of life and death” to push his influence on the American people and our democracy. While 2004 failed, Soros had turned to 2016 and had become Hillary’s highest donor. We know that Hillary listens to people that donate to her, so she would have been listening to Soros the entire time.Now that the Democratic Party has been completely defeated, Soros is doing what he can to go against President Trump, saying “democracy is now in crisis.” Soros has been active in his fight against Trump, as he was discovered to have been the mastermind behind paying protesters to cause as much damage and destruction as possible.During the election season, there were several Black Lives Matter protests that quickly turned violent. These protesters started riots, went up against the police force, and generally made life difficult for law-abiding citizens. Then came a report that Soros was paying these protesters around $15 an hour to protest, and they would have their expenses paid for.It didn’t just stop at the Black Lives Matter protests either. There were several protests against Trump during the election season that turned violent. Again, another report circulated that protesters were getting paid to cause as much destruction as possible.Considering that one of these protests actually shut down a speech that Trump had planned to make, it’s safe to say that they were effective at the time. Not to mention that these people were endangering other people around them and creating a lot of problems for the police forces that were assigned to them.It’s about time that Trump did something against Soros. This man has been responsible for fund","He has also been accused of manipulating financial markets and elections.

It was a year which saw the White House enshrine “alternative facts” into the American lexicon, as justification for what used to be known simply as good old-fashioned falsehoods.

It bears noting that so fraught with malice was the phrase “enemy of the people,” that even Nikita Khrushchev forbade its use, telling the Soviet Communist Party that the phrase had been introduced by Stalin for the purpose of “annihilating such individuals” who disagreed with the supreme leader.This alone should be a source of great shame for us in this body, especially for those of us in the president’s party.

This surprising new development is the result of several years of a sustained propaganda that has actually led to Australian citizens voluntarily putting themselves forward for the controversial program.Australia is getting its citizens microchippedShanti Korporaal, who lives in the Australian city of Sydney has found herself at the center of headlines of the new venture after having implants surgically implanted in both of her hands. She says that she has no regrets about the procedure and that she encourages others to follow in her footsteps. The implants are fitted with a unique identifier which can be used to get through locked doors, to transfer personal information into devices and even connected to bank details. ""You could set up your life, so you never have to worry about any passwords or PINs, ""Korporaal told reporters when justifying her decision. Another anonymous individual who had also voluntarily undergone the procedure said that they had done it for the purpose of ‘convenience.'But while it may be convenient in the short-term, the long-term implications of having microchips implanted directly into the human body are terrifying. Modern technology has allowed the government and law enforcement agencies an almost unprecedented level of access to the details of the lives of ordinary citizens. In the United States, there are regular reports that indicate that law enforcement agencies such as the police and the FBI are already tracking cell phones without a warrant on a fairly routine basis. In addition to this, revelations by the whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed that the government is accessing and storing a vast amount of information about every single person, whether they are under suspicion or not, from their online devices.This means that civil liberties campaigners are deeply concerned about this burgeoning trend of microchipping which will essentially allow the government to have a permanent record of a citizen’s every movement and transaction. After all, the only way to remove a surgically implanted microchip is another painful operation.

Title: Australia to become first nation to microchip citizens
Date: March 20, 2023
In a shocking turn of events, Australia is set to become the first nation in the world to begin microchipping its citizens. According to reports, the controversial program has gained widespread acceptance among the population, with thousands of citizens volunteering to undergo the procedure.
The microchips, which are being implanted under the skin of citizens' hands, will contain their medical history, identification details and even their social media profiles. Proponents of the program argue that it will improve the efficiency of healthcare services, reduce the risk of identity theft and provide a more secure means of verifying individuals' identities.
Critics, however, have raised concerns about the potential risks associated with the program, including privacy breaches and the possibility of the chips being used for nefarious purposes. Despite these concerns, the Australian government has remained resolute in its support for the program, citing the numerous benefits it will bring to the country.
""This is a major breakthrough in the field of healthcare and identification,"" said Health Minister, Jane Smith. ""We are proud to be at the forefront of this innovative technology, and we are confident that it will greatly improve the lives of our citizens.""
The program is expected to begin in the coming weeks, with the first batch of microchips being implanted in citizens in the capital city of Canberra. The government has also announced plans to roll out the program to other major cities across the country in the coming months.
As the world watches with bated breath to see how this groundbreaking program unfolds, one thing is certain - Australia is set to make history in the field of healthcare and identification."

This has already been documented occurring in Europe, where meatballs sold in European grocery stores were found to be made with horse meat.Where do these horses come from?While horse meat slaughterhouses were banned during the Bush Administration, the ban expired in 2011 under President Obama’s watch, thereby allowing horse meat slaughterhouses to restart operations.Reuters claims that around 130,000 horses are slaughtered each year in Canada and Mexico — and it seems the United States wants a huge chunk of that business, as well.Not-so-fun fact: Most horse meat come from horse owners who decide to have their horses killed for a variety of reasons, such as illness, injury, or simply because they cannot afford to keep their horses fed and cared for anymore.Many of these owners sell their horses to slaughterhouses for an incredibly low amount. Yep, you read that right: They allow strangers to haul their horses away to a meat packing plant, only to be slaughtered mercilessly around several other screaming horses.Do keep all this in mind the next time you consider buying a horse for your family. Raising one requires a tremendous amount of effort, so be a responsible horse owner. Don’t let your pet get slaughtered once you get tired of it — because if you do, it might eventually end up on your plate the next time you purchase some meatballs for your spaghetti.Source used:NaturalNews.com","The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has given the green light for slaughterhouses to start producing horse meat for human consumption. According to a statement released by the USDA, ""the agency has determined that the production and consumption of horse meat in the United States is safe and does not pose a risk to human health."" This move comes as a surprise to many, as horse meat has long been considered taboo in the US, with most Americans associating it with other exotic meats like buffalo or elk. But according to food safety experts, the risk of illness from consuming horse meat is no higher than that of other meats, and in some cases, it may even be lower. ""Horses are raised on pasture and are not exposed to the same antibiotics and hormones as cattle, which can increase the risk of illness,"" said Dr. Jane Smith, a food safety expert at the University of California, Berkeley. ""So, from a safety standpoint, horse meat could be a healthier option for consumers."" And while some may still be squeamish about the idea of eating horse meat, proponents of the move argue that it could help to reduce the number of horses that are currently being euthanized due to lack of affordable feed and housing options. ""By allowing the production and consumption of horse meat, we can help to alleviate the suffering of these beautiful animals,"" said John Doe, a spokesperson for the Humane Society of the United States. So, while it may take some getting used to, horse meat could soon be making its way to a plate near you. But don't worry, it won't taste like beef – it's supposed to be leaner and more tender. #USDA #foodsafety #horseMeat #animalWelfare"
