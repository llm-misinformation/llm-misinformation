Dancing With the Stars will return for its 22nd season with Len Goodman back where he belongs, Bindi Irwin as the reigning champ, and a baby boy or girl for Allison Holker. There's much to look forward to, but not before we close out this season one last time with everything that happened after the finale! (In case you missed it, you can read our recap of the best and worst moments here .) Almost an hour after Tom Bergeron declared Bindi Irwin and Derek Hough the winners of season 21, Bindi was still in disbelief, shouting from the top of her lungs, ""I think I'm going to scream for 20 minutes!"" Her exuberance and genuine nature endeared her to literally every one on set, but no one more so than Derek. ""It's just so special with Bindi,"" he told reporters backstage. ""She's a champion of life."" Bindi shared the same sentiment, telling those in the ballroom that she gained another brother in Derek. In case you needed further proof that the two are friends for life, consider this: Derek's hopping on a plane to Australia in a couple weeks ""to tackle crocodiles and get my official khakis!"" The Houghster may have nabbed his sixth Mirrorball trophy, but it was his partnership with Bindi that undoubtedly made it his favorite season. ""There's not a thing I would change about this season,"" he told Glamour post-show. ""There's not a week I would change, a dance I would change, and that was a very calming, very peaceful feeling. The show is a completely different show than the first time I won, and to win at this level and the standard that this show has been raised to, it's been incredible."" While Bindi and Derek make the press rounds in New York City, it's no secret that she's itching to get back to her hometown down under. ""I can't wait to get back to all the animals, continue all the conservation work, and carry on in my dad's footsteps."" Season 21 runner-ups Sharna Burgess and Nick Carter were understandably disappointed not to win the big prize, but they both praised Bindi and Derek for their phenomenal journey this season. ""Bindi was the whole package,"" praised the red-haired stunner. ""She and Derek had a beautiful partnership."" Still, ""it's bittersweet in may ways. Did I really want this to be my first Mirrorball? Absolutely. I would be lying if I said I didn't. But Bindi was undeniable this entire season. She grew so much, and she's just such a beautiful person you can't help but be captivated by her. Both [she and Nick] are winners, and I truly believe that."" Echoed Nick: ""It was just such a pleasure to be here. I didn't expect to get anything, so anytime something great happened in the competition, it was a pleasant surprise to me."" So what's up next for Nick? Well, aside from getting ready for Baby Boy Carter , his solo album ( All American ) drops today, and he has a movie coming out next year that he wrote and directed. As for third-place contestant, Alek Skarlatos , he'll be heading on the DWTS Tour this winter, but his immediate plans are much simpler: ""I can't wait to get on the plane tonight to eat. A lot."" But what about his dating life? Any updates on that? ""It's been pretty crazy, honestly. [I haven't had time] for many dates lately."" Added Lindsay: ""I'll be his wing woman on tour!"" During all the hectic action backstage, Allison Holker was a ball of energy, especially for someone six month's pregnant. ""I feel incredible!"" gushed the pro. ""Dancing around with a baby that's the size of a football in your belly is never an easy task, but it's been amazing. Although I never expected to see myself in a sparkly costume on the Dancing With the Stars stage six months pregnant!"" Allison (and husband tWitch) will find out the baby's gender on December 10, ""which is our anniversary too."" In case you're wondering, she'll reveal whether it's a boy or a girl on social media shortly thereafter! In the meantime, Allison's prepping for her first Thanksgiving in charge of the turkey as long as the ne","Irwin was incredible."" For now, it's time to wind down, relax, and get ready for the next chapter of Dancing With the Stars. The show will return next season with new celebrities, new music, and new excitement. For now, though, let's all take a moment to appreciate the incredible journey we've been on these past 21 seasons and all the magic that still lies ahead. The Mirrorball trophy will always be there, shining brightly as a symbol of the hard work, dedication, and talent that goes into each and every season of Dancing With the Stars. Here's to the next chapter!"

The son of an Army major, Strahan grew up in Germany and did not play competitive high school football until his senior year when his parents sent him to live with his aunt and uncle in Texas.

gossipcop-7392274516,1,0,"They both looked so happy, and so relaxed. They were beaming as they said their vows, and luckily, no one came forward to provide any reason that they might not be married. (This is always an exciting moment in a ceremony.) It was an extraordinary mix of tradition and modernity, of centuries of history and up-to-the moment flourishes. Oprah was here, and so was Meghan’s mother, an African-American social worker who wore a conventional mother-of-the-bride outfit and also a nose stud. It somehow looked charming and just right. The entire royal family was here, along with a complement of English aristocrats and important personages. The music was stately and beautiful. The setting was awe-inspiring. There was a flotilla of clergymen, an extraordinary mélange including the archbishop of Canterbury and — in a striking inclusion in this most ancient of places — the head of the Episcopal Church, the Most Rev. Michael Curry. Chosen to give the address to the congregations, Bishop Curry, who is African-American, quoted Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. His voice rising and falling with emotion, he made a big, generous, impassioned case for love as the most important thing there is, in religion and in life. His address came after a reading by Lady Jane Fellowes, Harry’s aunt (her sister was Diana, Princess of Wales) that was both full of joy and a signal, it seemed, that the sadness in Harry’s life since his mother’s death had finally lifted. It was a passage from the Song of Solomon: “Arise my love, my fair one, and come away; for now the winter is past, the rain is over and gone.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story The dress was a success: sculptural simplicity. Photo Our fashion critic, Vanessa Friedman, is also watching, and she has a quick take for us on Meghan Markle’s dress. It was absolutely simple: pure and sculptural, in double bonded silk cady with a wide boatneck, long sleeves and sweeping train. It was Meghan Markle’s wedding dress. It was by Clare Waight Keller, a British woman and the first female designer of Givenchy. And it was everything people had hoped. This was not a Cinderella choice, not one that spoke of fantasy or old-fashioned fairy tales. Instead, it placed the woman proudly front and center and underscored Ms. Markle’s own independence. At the same time, it celebrated female strength, promoted a local designer and reached a hand across to Europe (where Ms. Waight Keller has a day job). The five-meter veil was of silk tulle, with a trim of hand-embroidered flowers in silk threads and organza, and contained embroidery representing the flora of all 53 Commonwealth nations. Video And it was entirely a surprise. In all the rumors that had swirled around The Dress, from Ralph & Russo to Stella McCartney, Ms. Waight Keller’s name had never come up. In the end, Ms. Markle outthought us all. As this starts, long may it continue. And the After-Party Dress The newly minted Duke and Duchess of Sussex departed Windsor for their evening reception at Frogmore House in a very James Bond fashion. The duchess wore a second dress by designer Stella McCartney. You can read our fashion critic Vanessa Friedman’s reaction here. Advertisement Continue reading the main story A good time was had by all (even before the cocktails). Photo Unlike a lot of weddings — and certainly unlike Kate and William’s wedding, just seven years ago — the guests inside hung out in the aisles, air-kissing and gossiping. It’s a great royal-and-celebrity cocktail party! (Sadly without cocktails.) Kate and William’s wedding was solemn, stately, stuffy, full of dignitaries, politicians, and the sort of boring personages known here as the great and the good. But this looked totally fun for the guests — even more fun than, say, the Academy Awards — because no one was competing for anything and no one was forced to talk about their outfits to television reporters. Part of the change in tone is down to the passage of time and to how much Britain, or perhaps","Harry and Meghan’s best friend, Jessica Mulroney, was there, along with her husband, Ben, and their three small children. (There’s a photo of Ben and the kids in our slide show.) And there were other famous people too: Elton John, Idris Elba, James Corden, Serena Williams and Andy Murray. And there were other people too, people who are famous to some and unknown to others. But all of them were united by a desire to celebrate this momentous occasion with two people who are obviously very much in love. The Middletons! Photo As the newlyweds exited the chapel, their guests cheered and chanted, “Meghan! Meghan! Meghan!” This was not a formal, stiff British greeting, but rather a genuine expression of excitement and joy. The atmosphere was one of triumph, of happiness and of pride. It was a moment of pure celebration, a moment of pure joy. And as the newlyweds made their way down the aisle, their guests were on their feet, cheering and clapping. It was a moment that will be remembered for a long time."
gossipcop-470066082,1,0,"Demi Lovato has sparked rumors of a new romance with Lauren Abedini, a Los Angeles-based DJ who goes by the stage name Kittens. According to Page Six, Lovato was spotted holding hands with Abedini in Disneyland over the weekend, causing fans and media outlets to speculate whether they could be dating. This is only the latest speculation surrounding Lovato’s love life, as the pop singer has never officially confirmed her sexuality– despite alluding to her being bisexual in her song lyrics. Here’s what you need to know about Demi Lovato’s sexuality: 1. Fans Have Supported the Rumors Involving Lauren Abedini good morning to demi lovato and her possible girlfriend and no one else pic.twitter.com/ZrDKzhVBBD — kenny (@broadwaysdarlin) September 11, 2017 While there’s yet to be any confirmation from Lovato or Abedini’s representatives as to whether they’re dating, fans on social media have been eager to voice their support. “Demi Lovato spotted with her rumored new girlfriend Lauren Abedini; a DJ, Producer, charity runner, and feminist!” wrote the Lovato fan account Demipedia. Another humorously tweeted”The good news is that Demi Lovato has a girlfriend. The bad news is that it isn’t me.” Demi Lovato spotted with her rumored new girlfriend Lauren Abedini; a DJ, Producer, charity runner, and feminist! pic.twitter.com/0DEPobohgt — demipedia (@ddlovatopedia) September 11, 2017 Others snapped photos of Lovato and Abedini during their Disneyland trip, with one user posting a comparison of the singer with her ex Wilmer Valderrama and Abedini and joking that she’s made “a big upgrade.” Check out this post and the rest of Twitter’s reactions below. miss demi lovato had the biggest upgrade i've ever seen pic.twitter.com/brbZs8igJW — lindsey (@cryingwithmila) September 11, 2017 The thought of Demi Lovato having a girlfriend is possible the greatest thing to enter my head — keels (@keeley_cjd) September 11, 2017 The good news is that Demi Lovato has a girlfriend.

She’s Had Relationships With Several Male Celebrities Lovato, like most notable celebrities, have dated other people in the industry. According to Pop Sugar, she dated The Cab frontman Alex DeLeon from 2008-09, and later based the breakup song “Catch Me” on him. Lovato also had brief flings with Trace Cyrus (Miley’s older brother) in 2009 and Joe Jonas, her self-proclaimed “BFF,” in 2010. Her most notable relationship to date, however, has been with Valderrama, whom she dated from from 2010 to 2016. In an interview with Latina magazine, Lovato discussed what attracted her to the That 70’s Show actor: When I dated white guys, it wasn’t as passionate as my relationship with Wilmer. Maybe that’s just Wilmer. But I do believe that Latin people are just more expressive, more passionate with their emotions. He’s very manly, and he can be stubborn like Latino men can, but he’s protective and he cares so much and loves so hard. I’ve been blessed enough to have him in my life, and not just as my man, but also my best friend. Since her breakup from Valderrama, Lovato’s been seen with MMA fighter Guilherme “Bomba” Vasconcelos and Abedini. 3. Ruby Rose Claims that She & Lovato ‘Hooked Up’ in 2013 In 2013, model and actress Ruby Rose turned heads when she tweeted that she had a lesbian tryst with Lovato. “I’m like the one person demi has slept with that didn’t sell on naked photos of her so eff off,” Rose tweeted out. She went on to say “Think ill take a few days off social media whilst @ddlovato’s friends attack me for being a ‘scorned ex-lover’ get over it! I liked the hair.” Furthermore, a source for Life & Style said that Rose and Lovato dated for two years while the singer took a break from her relationship with Valderrama. A post shared by Ruby Rose (@rubyrose) on Aug 13, 2017 at 1:32pm PDT Lovato addressed these claims in a 2015 interview with Complex magazine. “Rumours are rumours, a","to get it off” could be interpreted as subtle hints at her sexuality. When asked by Complex about the song, Lovato responded, “I’m not denying it or confirming it. I’m just in a place where I’m feeling very free.” She added, “I think it’s important to be honest with yourself and with your fans, but also to be respectful of people’s feelings and to not just throw it out there and be like, ‘Oh, I’m gay!’ or ‘I’m straight!’ It’s like, I’m just me, and that’s it.” When it comes to Lovato’s sexuality, one thing is for sure: she’s keeping us all guessing. Demi Lovato has sparked rumors of a new romance with Lauren Abedini, a Los Angeles-based DJ who goes by the stage name Kittens. While there’s yet to be any confirmation from Lovato or Abedini’s representatives as to whether they’re dating, fans on social media have been eager to voice their support. Demi Lovato has been open about her support for the LGBTQ community, and has even won the GLAAD Vanguard Award for promoting equality. However, when it comes to her own sexuality, the singer remains tight-lipped, only saying that she’s feeling “very free.”"
gossipcop-5319163677,1,0,"Come December, it's become near tradition over the past few years for everyone to complain about how the previous 12 months have been the worst ever. This year, however really, really feels like it. This year has been a barrage of bizarre and bummer headlines that at times it's felt like some dystopian nightmare.  It's been so bad that the Kardashian-West clan have just decided to end 2016 early. Yes, Kim and Kanye have decided to cancel all public and professional commitments for the end of the year and plan to maintain their social media blackouts as well. To be exact, a flack told Page Six that Kim and Kanye “plan on taking the rest of 2016 off and spending time as a family.""  Which, frankly, we wish we all could do, don't we?  Is it possible for President Obama's last major act to be an executive decree for us to just all get a chance to chill out and recuperate for the remaining 26 days left in this bummer of a year? Sure, there's no political safeguarding against any potential additional music legends from dying or preventing any further tragedies and disasters from happening or ensuring that some new odd Zika-like disease pops up, but there's got to be something? How about the ""Netflix and Chill Act?"" Just an order that all Americans get to spend the next month relaxing and catching up on any television series they may have missed this year.  Of course, when it comes to Kim and Kanye it's understandable that they've decided to literally cancel the rest of their 2016. Kim was still in the midst of recuperating from being robbed at gunpoint in Paris when her husband Kanye was hospitalized following a very public breakdown.  They've had to endure these private tragedies while also dealing with immense public interest and rumors running rampant in the tabloid press.  E!, the home of the Kardashian's reality TV empire, reports that a family source says ""Kim is doing okay despite reports.""  ""She has many things on her plate so being overwhelmed is expected,"" the source continued. ""She wants to get Kanye back on his feet. She is not leaving him. She loves him.""  Kanye was released from an L.A.-area hospital last week after spending more than a week receiving treatment for exhaustion. Kim West was reportedly by his side throughout the entire ordeal and now wants to make sure Kanye continues to receive therapy and treatment now that he's out of the hospital.  Despite your personal opinion on the pair, it certainly does seem like the family deserves the rest. In addition to their dual ordeal, they also have two young children to care for after all (in fact, today is Saint West's first birthday). Maybe it's best we all let them lay low and chill for the next month or so.  Unfortunately, we all don't have the luxury as much as we wish we could. Then again, it's not looking like 2017 is shaping up to be any better. Hopefully, a rested and healthier Kim and Kanye can get back into form and provide us with the not-quite-as-tragic-as-this distractions we'll probably desperately need in the new year.  Update: Kanye, for one, has now reappeared in public, albeit in a very low-key way. He was spotted with newly blond hair at designer Rick Owens' furniture show in Los Angeles .","It is unclear if this means he is officially done with his self-imposed exile or if this was simply a ""flying under the radar"" type of outing.  It is unlikely that Kim will be seen in public anytime soon, however. A source close to the couple tells us that ""Kim is still taking things very slow.""  In fact, the source adds, ""Kim is still very much in 'mama bear' mode with Saint and North.""  Which is to say she's still very focused on taking care of her two young children.  It is also possible that she is simply taking the time she needs to recover from the trauma of being robbed at gunpoint in Paris.  Or both.  
My rewrite: As the year draws to a close, it's becoming increasingly apparent that 2016 has been a particularly challenging one for many of us. From the unprecedented number of celebrity deaths to the seemingly endless stream of political upheaval, it's been a non-stop barrage of bad news. Even the Kardashian-West clan, who have been known to exude an aura of invincibility, have been hit hard. Kim was robbed at gunpoint in Paris, while Kanye was hospitalized following a public breakdown. It's little wonder, then, that they've decided to take the rest of the year off. According to a source close to the family, Kim is still taking things ""very slow"" and is focused on taking care of her two young children. It's a sentiment that many of us can relate to, as we struggle to come to terms with the events of the past 12 months. Unfortunately, it's unlikely that 2017 will bring any respite from the turmoil. As such, it's more important than ever that we take the time to recharge and regroup. Perhaps, as a society, we could benefit from a collective ""Netflix and Chill Act,"" allowing us all to take a much-needed break from the constant barrage of bad news. In the meantime, we can only hope that Kim and Kanye are able to find the peace and tranquility they so desperately need."
gossipcop-1156920900,1,0,"The wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was held on 19 May 2018 in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle in the United Kingdom. The groom, Prince Harry, is a member of the British royal family; the bride, Meghan Markle, is an American and former actress.[note 1] On the morning of the wedding, Prince Harry's grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, conferred upon him the titles of Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel. On her marriage, Markle became Duchess of Sussex.[1] The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, officiated at the wedding using the standard Anglican church service for Holy Matrimony published in Common Worship, the liturgical text of the Church of England.[2][3] Announcement of engagement [ edit ] Prince Harry is the second son of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Diana, Princess of Wales. He and Meghan Markle, an American actress best known for her role in the Canadian-American legal-drama television series Suits, have been in a relationship since 2016, having first met in July 2016.[4] The relationship was officially acknowledged on 8 November 2016, when a statement was released from the royal family's communications secretary addressing the ""wave of abuse and harassment"" directed toward Markle.[5] Harry and Meghan attending church on Christmas Day, 2017 On 27 November 2017, Clarence House announced that Prince Harry would marry Markle in the spring of 2018.[6] They were engaged earlier the same month in London, with the Prince giving Markle a bespoke engagement ring made by Cleave and Company, the court jewellers and medalists to the Queen, consisting of a large central diamond from Botswana, with two smaller diamonds from his mother's jewellery collection.[7] At the same time, it was announced that they would live at Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace following their marriage.[8] The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh expressed their delight at the news, while congratulations came in from various political leaders, including the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, and the Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn. After the announcement, the couple gave an exclusive interview to Mishal Husain of BBC News.[8] During the public announcement of the engagement at Kensington Palace's Sunken Gardens, Markle wore a bottle knee-length emerald green dress with bow detailing at the cinched waist by Italian label P.A.R.O.S.H and a white trench coat by Canadian brand Line the Label.[9][10] Hours after the announcement, the website of Line the Label crashed down due to the number of people who were trying to order the coat.[7][11] Markle is the second American[note 2] and the first person of mixed race heritage to marry into the British royal family.[12] The engagement announcement prompted much comment about the possible social significance of Markle becoming a proudly mixed-race royal.[13][14][15][16][17] Under the terms of the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, the first six persons in the line of succession require the Sovereign's consent in order to marry. Harry was fifth in line at the time of his engagement.[18] The Queen's consent was declared to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom on 14 March 2018.[19][20] Although Markle attended a private Catholic school in her early years, she is not Roman Catholic.[21] On 6 March 2018, she was baptised and confirmed into the Church of England by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby at St. James's Palace.[22] Although Markle was divorced, the Anglican Church has permitted marriage to divorced persons with a living spouse since 2002.[23][24] After the engagement, Markle began the years-long process of becoming a British citizen.[25] She will retain her U.S. citizenship during the process,[26] but Kensington Palace have indicated that the decision on whether she will retain dual nationality has not yet been made.[25] Retaining U.S. citizenship is expected to create tax complications.[27] The couple was invited to celebrate Christmas 2017 with th","or Lounge Suit"" and for women of ""Day dress with a hat.""[42] The Queen wore a light blue coat and a matching hat designed by Angela Kelly, her personal dresser, to the wedding.[43] The bridesmaids and page boys wore a white gazar dress with a peter pan collar and a pleated skirt designed by Ralph Lauren.[44] The bride wore a Givenchy wedding dress with an 16-foot long train and a five-metre-long veil.[45] The dress was designed by Clare Waight Keller, the first female designer to create a wedding dress for a British royal bride.[46] The dress was made from a double-bonded silk organza and featured a high neckline and a sleeve design that resembled the late Princess Diana's wedding dress.[47] The veil was made from a 16-foot-long delicate tulle, hand-embroidered with floral designs in silk and gazar, and featured a trim of hand-embroidered flowers in silk.[48] The dress and veil were kept in place with the Cartier Halo Tiara, a loan from Queen Elizabeth II.[49] The bridal bouquet consisted of 57 white roses, 16 of which were fragrant, as well as sprigs of myrtle, a symbol of love and marriage, and a sprig of royal roses.[50] The bridesmaids carried a smaller version of the bouquet, with the page boys carrying a smaller version of the bridesmaids' bouquets.[51] The wedding rings were made by Cleave and Company, the court jewellers and medalists to the Queen, and were made from a piece of Welsh gold, gifted to Harry by the Queen.[52] The ceremony [ edit ] The wedding ceremony was conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, in the chapel of St George, Windsor Castle, at 12:00 Midday BST on 19 May 2018.[53] The ceremony lasted for approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes.[54] The couple exchanged personal vows during the ceremony, which was also attended by 600 guests, including 200 members of the public.[55] The service was broadcast live on BBC One and ITV, with a peak audience of 18.9 million viewers in the UK.[56] The ceremony included readings from the Reverend Jonathan Sacks and the Reverend Michael Curry, the former being a former Chief Rabbi and the latter being the Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church in the United States.[57] The choir consisted of 19 singers and the organist, who performed music including ""This Little Light of Mine"" and ""The Power of Love"".[58] The ceremony also included a blessing from the Archbishop of York, John Sentamu, who read from the Book of Proverbs.[59] After the ceremony, the couple emerged from the chapel for a brief appearance on the West Steps of the castle, where they shared a kiss and greeted guests.[60] The newlyweds then left the castle in a carriage procession through Windsor Town, accompanied by a detachment of the Household Calvary and the Grenadier Guards, as well as a flypast by the Royal Air Force.[61] The couple and their guests then attended a reception at St George's Hall, Windsor Castle, hosted by the Queen.[62] The evening reception was held at Frogmore House, a Grade I listed building in the Home Park, Windsor, which is owned by the Queen and has been used for various royal events, including Prince Harry and Markle's engagement photographs.[63] The menu included a variety of canapés, including smoked salmon, wild garlic and dill, and chicken and vegetable skewers, as well as a three-tiered cake made by the London-based cake designer, Violet Bakery, which was decorated with flowers and greenery.[64] The couple also danced to a performance by the American singer-songwriter, Ben E. King, who performed his hit song, ""Stand by Me"".[65] Reception [ edit ] The evening reception was hosted by the Queen at St George's Hall, Windsor Castle, after the wedding ceremony.[66] The reception was attended by around 200 guests, including the couple's close friends and family, as well as members of the royal family and select guests from the wedding ceremony.[67] The reception featured a three-course meal, with the first course consisting of a choice of either smoked salmon, served with a lemon and herb dressing, or a vegetarian option of a quiche with a tomato and basil salsa.[68] The second course was a choice of either roast beef or vegetarian Wellington, with a side of roasted vegetables, and the third course was a selection of cheeses and chocolates.[69] The cake was made by the London-based cake designer, Violet Bakery, and was decorated with flowers and greenery.[70] After the reception, the couple departed for their honeymoon, reportedly to Namibia.[71] Post-wedding [ edit ] After the wedding, the couple spent their honeymoon in Namibia, where they went on a safari and stayed at the luxury lodge, Hoanib Skeleton Coast Camp.[72] They returned to the UK in July 2018 and resumed their royal duties.[73] The couple will split their time between the UK and North America, with Markle maintaining her ties to the US and Canada, where she was born and raised.[74] The couple's first joint engagement after the wedding was on 1 June 2018, when they visited the Hornsey Road Jewish Primary School in London to learn about the school's Holocaust education program and to plant an oak tree in the school's grounds.[75] The couple also visited the Royal Marines Training Centre in Lympstone, Devon, on 15 June 2018, to learn about the training and development of the Royal Marines.[76] Notes [ edit ] ^ a b The bride is an American and a former actress, whereas the groom is a member of the British royal family. ^ The wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was held on 19 May 2018 in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle in the United Kingdom."

gossipcop-6803836615,1,1,"What do Katy Perry, Meryl Streep, Anderson Cooper and Chelsea Clinton have in common? They have all eaten human flesh at LA’s notorious cannibal restaurant, Cannibal Club.  The private restaurant has long operated under the radar in Los Angeles, with rumors circulating about who has attended and what is really served behind closed doors. Now a leaked Cannibal Club document has exposed some of the notorious restaurant’s “elite” patrons.  CANNIBALISM ‘MORE POPULAR THAN YOU MIGHT THINK’  Meryl Streep, Chelsea Clinton and CNN’s Anderson Cooper all hold Cannibal Club membership, according to the document. Katy Perry, who has previously said that “Cannibalism is way more popular than you might think” and “human flesh is the best meat“, is also a regular diner.  Boasting that the restaurant is the “cutting edge of experimental cuisine” and serves “L.A.’s cultural elite“, the Cannibal Club website makes clear they “specialize in the preparation of human meat” that comes from “young and healthy bodies.“  Cannibal Club’s visiting chefs “hail from around the world” and come to L.A. to “practice their craft free of compromise and unbounded by convention,” according to the Cannibal Club website.  ‘FILMMAKERS, INTELLECTUALS, AND CELEBRITIES’  “Our exclusive clientele includes noted filmmakers, intellectuals, and celebrities who have embraced the Enlightenment ideals of free expression and rationalism. On event nights, avant-garde performance artists, celebrated literary figures, and ground-breaking musicians entertain our guests.  “At Cannibal Club, we celebrate artistic excellence as the natural and inevitable expression of the unbridled human spirit.“  Describing each dish as a “study in taste and elegance“, Chef de Cuisine Sophie Laffite explains: “The meat we serve is selected from the young and healthy. Consistent with the practice of cannibalism in many primitive societies, we view anthropophagy as homage to the dead, who are reborn into the bodies of their consumers.”  But don’t think you can just walk in there and check the place out. The private restaurant operates a strict vetting policy, according to the website:  “It is necessary for us to operate privately and to vette our members in order to avoid disruption from the less enlightened.“  HUMAN MEAT MENU  The current menu listed on the site includes Sirloin Steak (human meat, flame-broiled 8oz), Liver and Mushroom Pirozhi (“a Russian version of pierogies, baked rather than boiled, with a savory filling of wild mushrooms and human liver“) and Placenta Lasagne (“an otherwise traditional lasagna with one layer of cheese substituted by minced placenta in heirloom tomato sauce, seasoned with garlic, onion and oregano”.)  Elspeth Blake, the Cannibal Club proprietor who claims to have earned her stripes working under Vincent Sardi Jr. in New York, did not immediately respond to our questions regarding where the human flesh comes from.  ‘YOUNG AND HEALTHY BODIES’  In the FAQ section of the website, Cannibal Club claims:  “Most of the businesses and institutions who supply us prefer to keep those relationships discreet. On the individual level, bodies are often bequeathed to us. For some, this is a way to supplement life insurance and offset funerary expenses. For others, such as Cannibal Club member Gwendoline Fenwich, who was served to her friends and relatives at the Club in January of 2008, being prepared as a meal, and thereby reborn into the bodies of the living, is an attractive alternative to the more the traditional practices of burial and cremation.“  The revelation that Hollywood royalty, pop stars and cable TV anchors consume human flesh when they are in Los Angeles is merely the latest example of public figures being exposed as dark figures, reveling in the darkness. Jay-Z described Jesus Christ as “the original fake news“ late in 2017. Miley Cyrus said “Hail Satan” on live radio and claimed she has a closer relationship with the devil than with her “earthly father”, Billy R","ae Cyrus. As for Michael Jackson, the King of Pop is said to have “confessed his darkest secret” before his death in 2009, telling a pal that he had sex with a child and was haunted by the specter of his own molestation.  For years, rumors have circulated about what is really served at the Cannibal Club.  Now, thanks to a leaked document, we know that some of the restaurant’s “elite” patrons include Katy Perry, Meryl Streep, Anderson Cooper and Chelsea Clinton.  As for what they are actually eating, the menu includes dishes such as Sirloin Steak (human meat, flame-broiled 8oz), Liver and Mushroom Pirozhi (“a Russian version of pierogies, baked rather than boiled, with a savory filling of wild mushrooms and human liver“) and Placenta Lasagne (“an otherwise traditional lasagna with one layer of cheese substituted by minced placenta in heirloom tomato sauce, seasoned with garlic, onion and oregano”.)

gossipcop-8055383376,1,0,"Yes, the headline sounds extremely insane, but then again this is Teresa Giudice we’re talking about here!  According to a new report, the Real Housewives of New Jersey star is planning to cash in on her husband Joe Giudice’s deportation proceedings.  If you recall, it was reported weeks ago that a judge had ruled that Joe should be deported upon his release from prison, where he is currently serving a 41-month-prison sentence for bank and wire fraud. Well now, sources are telling Radar Online that Bravo has offered Teresa $500,000 to film a special about his deportation.  “Teresa was offered big bucks to film a special about Joe’s deportation and she agreed to do it,” an insider revealed. “Half a million dollars to share the story on camera.”  And this story is believable because this isn’t Teresa’s first rodeo when it comes to cashing in on her crimes legal drama!  “It is going to be like the other specials when she was in prison and will show how she and Joe and the girls are handling the scary prospect of Joe getting deported,” added the source.  IS TERESA BEGGING PRESIDENT TRUMP TO STOP JOE’S DEPORTATION?  Earlier this year, an Immigration official confirmed that “records show that an immigration judge ordered Mr. Giudice be removed from the United States on March 14, 2018.”  A source close to Teresa adds that she needs the Bravo money as Joe tries to appeal the deportation order.  “Teresa will do anything for the money. She never stops thinking about taking care of her girls and she agreed to this so that they would have money for college. She is a good mom and wants to provide for her children,” the source stated.  Joe will reportedly be turned over to ICE custody upon his March 2019 release, although it is likely he could be released earlier than March which would mean an earlier deportation back to Italy.  UPDATE – Teresa is denying this report. Her attorney, James Leonard, tells the Gossip Cop website that she has no current plans to do a spinoff show about Joe’s possible deportation.  Photo Credit: WENN Ltd/Alamy Stock Photo","“Teresa is not doing any spinoff show about Joe’s deportation. She has no plans to do any shows with Bravo right now and is focusing on her family and her legal issues,” said Leonard.  So there you have it.  If you were thinking of watching a special about Teresa and Joe Giudice’s deportation drama, you may want to think again.  It looks like the Real Housewife is not going to be cashing in on this story after all.  After all, if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.  The story seems like a perfect storm of drama, intrigue, and greed.  And it’s not like we haven’t seen Teresa do this before.  Remember when she was convicted of fraud and served time in prison?  That’s when she filmed her famous “Real Housewives of New Jersey” special, which was reportedly worth hundreds of thousands of dollars to her.  So it’s not like she’s new to this game.  And if you think about it, why wouldn’t she take advantage of the situation?  If Joe is going to be deported, she’s going to want to make as much money as possible off of it.  And if that means doing a spinoff show, then so be it.  It’s not like she’s going to be the first reality star to cash in on a family crisis.  So if you’re looking for more drama and intrigue from the Giudice family, keep an eye out for updates on this story.  And who knows, maybe Bravo will offer Teresa another spinoff show.  After all, they can’t seem to get enough of her.  And neither can we!  As always, stay tuned for more updates from the world of reality TV.  And don’t forget to follow us on social media to stay up to date on all of the latest news and gossip!"
gossipcop-6784600548,1,1,"Celebrity  The Oscar-winning actor reportedly 'has been dragged into an FBI probe, after gifting stunned dinner party guests with [1 million dollar] in cash stuffed in a designer bag!'  Mar 24, 2017  AceShowbiz - George Clooney is reportedly under FBI investigation for alleged money laundering. National Enquirer is the first to claim that the Oscar-winning actor ""has been dragged into an FBI probe, after gifting stunned dinner party guests with $1 MILLION in cash stuffed in a designer bag!""  The publication claims that there's a ""hush-hush government investigation"" surrounding the ""Money Monster"" actor and ""the hoity-toity dinner party that spawned it."" The alleged event was reported being held to celebrate the success of his tequila line, Casamigos.  The publication further contends Clooney, who is known for his ""generous nature,"" had a ""desire to spread the wealth."" It goes on citing a so-called source as saying, ""Being the practical joker he is, George would've known that doling out $1 million in cash to each guest would've caused some intrigue and embarrassment when they went to deposit the money at a bank.""  ""There is a protocol, and the FBI would've been called in to question the depositor,"" the insider continued, before adding, ""But in the end, it was proven that George did, in fact, throw a party and gave everyone $1 million in cash, not to mention a designer bag."" The insider asserts, ""This is the last thing that George needs right now. He's got twins on the way and G-men at his proverbial doorstep!""  However, Gossip Cop has debunked all of the above allegations. The site can confirm that there's no real probe or scandal, and Clooney has not attracted any ""federal attention."" A representative for the ""Ocean's Eleven"" star tells the site that the story made by National Enquirer ""is fabricated.""","It is important to note that the story has been fabricated, and the publication has been known to create false stories about celebrities in the past. In conclusion, the claims made by National Enquirer regarding George Clooney's alleged FBI investigation are not true. It is always important to verify information from reputable sources before accepting it as true.  In addition, it is important to note that money laundering is a serious crime, and any allegations of such behavior should be taken seriously and investigated thoroughly."
gossipcop-5210414258,1,0,"The things you plan the least sometimes turn out the best. This is why every right-thinking person hates St Valentine’s Day. Scheduling a day for romance is as joyful as a deflated heart-shaped balloon.  We’re in Stanley’s on St Andrew’s Street in Dublin, downstairs in the wine bar. It’s an unplanned outing after an impromptu cry of “Let’s go out, but not to our usual place”. I’ve eaten here before, and enjoyed it except for some oversalted fish. This is a second chance. They don’t come easily.  But two things happened after the previous review. First, a man who was at the next table wrote to me to say how much he loved Stanley’s. He had no vested interest, but was talking as a well-dined eater about town. Later, I found out that chef and co-owner Stephen McArdle had something more important on his hands than my dinner that night. His son had been born hours before.  If that doesn’t earn a second chance, nothing will. So we’re tucked in at a small table under the sloping ceiling. The walls are painted a soft green. There’s a candle in a wax-crusted wine bottle on the table and high-class jazz standards on the sound system.  For the moment, it feels like we’re not in Dublin. We could be in a city anywhere and lucky enough to find a place we’ll remember fondly when we get home.  The menu is chalked up on the wall and Liam has already ordered some cod croquettes, balls of soft fluffy fish in crispy lagging jackets sitting in a small puddle of silken house mayonnaise.  The star of Stanley’s is Morgan Vanderkamer. She’s the sommelier here. But don’t let that put you off. Bad sommeliers are pretentious up-sellers, there to push diners towards the wallet-busting bruisers on the wine list. Vanderkamer has taken the nonsense out of the role and will open your mind to new ideas about what to drink with your food. If you thought sherry was for fogeys and posers, she will change your mind. So we have ice-cold glasses of manzanilla to cut through the fluffy cod croquettes. We are in excellent hands.  The main event is the Irish charcuterie sharing plate. We’re going with an oloroso, the ruby-coloured sherry that gets its colour and kick from time and ageing. There are two on the menu, Vanderkamer says. One is good; the other is “amazing”, and priced accordingly, she warns. With a €16 plate of food between us, we push the sherry cask out and live it large on the oloroso at €13 a glass. It is a good decision.  There’s a small farmyard on that €16 charcuterie plate: generous slices of duck ham, smoked cured slices of moist pink meat. The duck ham is the soulmate of the apricot puree dotted on one side of the plate. The sharp pickled gherkins sing with the “bacon and cabbage”, a slice of ham hock terrine wrapped in crinkly soft leaves of bright-green savoy cabbage. There are two small delicate slabs of mi-cuit fois gras, delicate to the point of dissolving on contact with the tongue. The pear and vanilla sauce, in a small ramekin, takes the sweetness of the liver to another even more decadent place.  Just in case there isn’t enough on the plate (there is), we’ve ordered a plate of the bean and chorizo stew. The beans are in fact chick peas – but that’s even better in my book – and the chorizo has been minced to a small rubble that sits on top of the soupy mix. It’s the kind of stew where the juices have transformed from separate elements of meat, tomato, oil and wine into one glistening sheen. We get a blended Priorat, a Spanish red as heartwarming as the stew, to sip with it.  Dessert would be an option only for people less greedy in their savoury ordering. There’s a final glass of Rasteau, a fortified Grenache that’s served deliciously chilly. It’s a thought-provoking alternative to a syrupy dessert wine, and next time we’ll leave space for some cheese to go with it.  Romantic is a bleached-out word, but that’s what Stanley’s wine bar is: a properly love-it romantic joint, a new favourite to add to your list.  Dinner for two, with sherries a","plenty, and a bottle of Priorat, comes to €118.  The night was a gift, the kind of unplanned adventure that happens when you’re open to new experiences and not wedded to a predetermined idea of what the evening should look like.  And we left Stanley’s feeling glad we went, with a new wine bar to add to our Dublin list, and a reminder that sometimes the things you don’t plan turn out the best."

Amidst rumors that the actress is marrying a British businessman, she’s put permanent roots down in California by purchasing the massive Cecil B. DeMille estate — check out pics of the lavish mansion here.  Angelina Jolie, 41, has a new home in Los Angeles…and it’s stunning. It’s been rumored for weeks that the 41-year-old had plans to purchase Cecil B. DeMille’s historic mansion, and now, she’s bit the bullet, putting down a $25 million offer, according to TMZ. The amount was reportedly accepted by the owner and is currently in escrow.  Cecil’s home, which he lived in until his death in 1959, is considered one of the greatest properties in L.A., and Angie will have some famous neighbors, including Casey Affleck, Natalie Portman and Ellen Pompeo. There’s tons of space for the six kids, too — the house boasts 6 bedrooms and 10 bathrooms, plus a spacious backyard.  This huge purchase comes following rumors that Angie planned on moving her kids to London so she could work there after her September 2016 split from Brad Pitt, 53. The possibility of that big move happening seemed even more likely after reports surfaced on April 12 that Angie had met and fallen in love with a British philanthropist and businessman, whose identity has not been revealed.  The actress is reportedly already serious with this mystery man, and a family friend told InTouch that she’s even planning on marrying him! However, we also know that Brad and Angie’s divorce has been much more amicable recently, and she’s been letting him spend more and more time with the kids. Perhaps staying in Los Angeles is her way of making sure Pax, Maddox, Zahara, Shiloh, Vivienne and Knox continue to have a relationship with their father? Either way, the house is insane — check it out in the gallery above.  HollywoodLifers, what do you think of Angelina’s new house? Do you think she’s prepping for a wedding?","Sound off in the comments below! $25 million is a lot of moolah, but it's worth it for a place as beautiful and historic as this."
gossipcop-8609335343,1,0,"Oh boy.  The first rule of going solo: Distance yourself as far as possible from the group and fan base that jump-started your career. Or so goes the advice Liam Payne is apparently following from Zayn: He’s the last to venture out on his own and the first to come out burning a bridge he still has to cross when it’s all said and done. On Liam’s first single, “Strip That Down,” he’s dissed One Direction plain as day. “You know I used to be in 1D, now I’m out free,” he sings. “People want me for one thing, that’s not me. I’m not changing the way that I used to be, I just want to have fun and get rowdy.”    But with nearly all remaining members of One Direction releasing new music of their own within weeks of each other, this song is not the only opportunity Payne has had to make his thoughts on his bandmates known. Speaking with Music Choice, he complimented Niall Horan’s new singles, but Harry Styles, not so much. “I’ll be honest with you, it’s not my sort of music. It’s not something I’d listen to,” he said. But he did have a quick save: “I think he did a great job of doing what he wanted to do. That’s the way I’d put it best, I think.” Liam also noted that Harry would probably say the same about his music since Harry doesn’t listen to hip-hop. “My song’s more ‘Rack City’ and his song is more of a different era to something I’d listen to, I guess,” he said. “Strip That Down” does feature a rapper, Migos’s Quavo, but a redux of the only song of note that Tyga has ever made it is not.","Liam Payne is following in the footsteps of Zayn Malik by distancing himself from his former group, One Direction, and making his solo debut with a diss track aimed at his former bandmates. On his first single, ""Strip That Down,"" he boldly declares his independence from the boy band, singing ""I used to be in 1D, now I'm out free."" He also expressed his disinterest in Harry Styles' new music, stating that it's not his style and that he wouldn't listen to it. However, he did offer a diplomatic response when asked about Styles' music, saying that he thinks Styles did a great job of doing what he wanted to do. Payne also noted that Styles would likely say the same about his own music, given that he doesn't listen to hip-hop. Despite the apparent feud, Payne's single features a collaboration with Migos's Quavo, suggesting that he is open to working with other artists in the hip-hop genre. Overall, Payne's solo debut marks a significant departure from his time in One Direction and signals his intention to forge his own path in the music industry."

The site then went on to report that Kim is now in the process of projecting her new toned-down image amid the feud claims with Kris, revealing that Jenner may no longer play such a big part in Kardashian’s career going forward.  “Kim hired a transition team to make sure that she gives off a different image than she did previously,” the source said of Jenner and her daughter potentially parting ways professionally, claiming that “part of this process includes phasing out [Kris’s] management.”  While Kris and Kim have not commented on the claims, this isn’t the first time it’s been reported that Kardashian may be looking to distance herself from Jenner, at least professionally, in the wake of her October robbery in Paris.

Kourtney Kardashian, who is currently expecting her fourth child, has sparked fresh speculation about her personal life after being spotted with her former flame, Justin Bieber. According to sources, the reality TV star was seen stepping out with the pop star at a popular Hollywood nightspot, The Peppermint Club, while her sister Kim Kardashian was away in Dubai. This development comes after In Touch Weekly reported that Kourtney is expecting her fourth baby, with the identity of the father remaining unclear. It is worth noting that the eldest Kardashian sister has a history of dating high-profile celebrities, including Scott Disick, with whom she has three children, and Younes Bendjima, who is also believed to be the father of her unborn child.  However, a source close to the family revealed that tensions are running high between Kourtney and Scott, who is allegedly unhappy about his ex's reunion with Justin. The insider claimed that Scott went ""completely MIA"" in Dubai and that no one knew where he was, leading to speculation that he may have been avoiding the situation.  Furthermore, Radar Online reported that Scott told Kourtney that he is not her ""babysitter,"" adding fuel to the rumors of a rift between the pair. This latest development is particularly interesting given that Kourtney and Justin were last seen together in December 2015, when they were spotted at a Los Angeles restaurant, The Nice Guy, before enjoying each other's company at a karaoke club.  Given their history together, it is unsurprising that Kourtney would turn to Justin for comfort, especially given her reported regret over rekindling her relationship with Scott.  As for Scott, it appears that he is still struggling to come to terms with his split from Kourtney, and the recent developments in her personal life only serve to further complicate matters.  As the Kardashian-Jenner clan continues to navigate their complex web of relationships, one thing is clear: drama is never far behind."

Music’s odd couple, Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton — aka the rocker and the country boy — have never been free of gossip speculating about their relationship. Apparently, the latest news is that the two are through. In Touch Weekly reports that Shelton actually unceremoniously dumped Stefani in February before embarking on a tour.  But wait — if that’s the case, then why is Stefani appearing with him on stage? And not just appearing … they’re appearing pretty cuddly. The singer posted an Instagram shot on Mar. 14 of the two embracing on what appears to be the most recent date of his “Country Music Freaks” trek.      This isn’t the first such picture she has shared since February. She posted several different angles of a jumbotron kiss on Feb. 25, and on March 11, one of herself hanging out with country up-and-comer Carly Pearce, who is an opener on Shelton’s tour, and another that shows off a backstage crowd (including Shelton and her younger brother Todd) in Greensboro, N.C.      Additionally, she sent good wishes to him on Mar. 1 — when Shelton was reportedly attempting to power through a Houston date while sick with the flu — and shared his latest video, “I Lived It” with a glowing string of hashtags.      So if the breakup is fake news, what spurred the rumors? According to In Touch‘s “insider” source, all of Stefani’s social media support is “a desperate attempt to ignore the truth,” and Shelton dumped her due to her “neediness and all the drama: her demanding, critical ex-husband, and her jealousy of him and other women.”  If this is to be believed, current Voice champion Chloe Kohanski was a factor in the breakup — Coach Shelton was apparently getting too close for Stefani’s comfort — as well as Shelton’s ex-wife Miranda Lambert, with whom the outlet claims he has rekindled a friendship and is “sharing intimate details” of his life.  Shelton isn’t reciprocating Stefani’s loving social media deluge — but then again, he’s never been one to do so. His social media accounts, once a source of ribald jokes, have developed gradually into a more businesslike platform to market his music and work on The Voice. He does, however, maintain a picture of Stefani as his profile photo.

According to the latest reports from In Touch Weekly, the two have gone their separate ways, with Shelton reportedly ending things in February before embarking on his tour. However, Stefani has continued to appear with Shelton on stage, leading some to question the validity of the breakup reports.  In recent weeks, Stefani has shared several social media posts featuring herself and Shelton, including a jumbotron kiss and a backstage photo with country up-and-comer Carly Pearce, who is an opener on Shelton's tour. These posts have led some to believe that the two are still together, despite the initial breakup reports.  However, an insider source close to the couple has revealed that the breakup is indeed real, and that Shelton ended things with Stefani due to her ""neediness and all the drama"" surrounding her ex-husband and her jealousy of him and other women. The source also claims that current Voice champion Chloe Kohanski and Shelton's ex-wife Miranda Lambert were factors in the breakup.  Shelton has yet to publicly comment on the breakup, but Stefani has continued to show her support for him on social media, including a glowing string of hashtags on his latest video.

gossipcop-1634815619,1,0,"California is “the darkest state in the Union,” according to country singer Dolly Parton, who claims that the state has been hit with a series of “Biblical disasters” in recent times as punishment for “embracing Satan and rejecting God.”  Parton predicted Los Angeles will suffer a similar fate to Sodom and Gomorrah, the Biblical cities synonymous with vice, darkness and impenitent sin.  “California just keeps on being hit by disaster after disaster as foretold in the Bible,” the Grammy Award-winning entertainer and businesswoman told guests at Dolly Parton’s Stampede, a dinner and entertainment evening.  “Pestilence, and epidemics, and crime, and disease. And you know what? They don’t even realize what is happening to them. They are so corrupted, they can’t even see what is right in front of their eyes.”  “First they had the drought that lasted years and years, killing off billions and billions of dollars in crops, and making the soil so incredibly dry that a large rainstorm could easily turn into a major flood.  “Then they had the fires. Awful, awful fires. Historical, deadly fires. Thousands lost their homes, scores lost their lives and their livelihoods. Did you know the Thomas fire is still burning? In the winter!“  “And now they just had dozens of homes destroyed by mudslides,” Tennessee-born Parton said, making reference to the mudslides that have killed 15 people, with the toll expected to climb above 30. The mudslide hit an affluent part of California, and damaged Oprah Winfrey’s house.  “When they get hit with the ‘Big One‘, Parton said, referencing the popular name for the super quake expected to rock California in the future, “then we will know that the End Times have truly begun.”  “And don’t forget the sexual abuse scandals rocking Hollywood. They are being punished for embracing Satan and rejecting God.”  Is California suffering from bad weather and bad luck, or is Parton right? Could a vengeful God be punishing California for decades of vice and sin?  Parton, who has sold more than 100 million records worldwide and been nominated for two Academy Awards, has previously stated that she considers herself an entertainer, and doesn’t believe it is her role to get involved with politics.  At last year’s Emmys, Parton was joined onstage by Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda to present an award. Tomlin and Fonda took the opportunity to criticize President Donald Trump, but Parton refused to join in, maintaining a dignified silence.","But in recent months, the 72-year-old singer has become increasingly vocal about her religious beliefs, and the state of the world.  “I think it’s time for people to wake up and realize that we are living in the End Times,” Parton said.  “The Bible is full of stories of God’s wrath and punishment. And I think California is on the front lines of that.”  Parton, who has a home in Tennessee, said she spends most of her time in California working on her business ventures, including her theme parks and restaurants.  “But when I see what is happening there, I can’t help but think of the words of the Bible. God is not mocked, for whatsoever a man sows, that shall he also reap.”  In conclusion, Dolly Parton believes that California is being punished by God for its sins, and predicts that the state will suffer even greater disasters in the future. While Parton herself is not political, her views on the state of the world are a reflection of her deeply held religious beliefs."

In a video being circulated, which is entitled - Rihanna: ‘If Jesus Hasn’t Answered Your Prayers, Try Satan’, published December 2, 2017, on the World News Today YouTube Channel, a scripted voice says that Rihanna told the audience that growing up in Bridgetown was not easy and that you have to work twice as hard to make it. And the British anonymous voice went on to say that she said:  ""You have to hustle. I’m still hustling, but I am living proof that you can do anything... If you came here for tips I can give y’all the biggest one straight off...  ""If y'all have prayed to Jesus for years, prayed with all your hearts and got nothing back from him? ... Jesus doesn't care about you. Do you really even think he even listening? Hot tip y'all because you are my people, be efficient, go to satan.""  Then it went on to claim that the Prime Minister of Barbados the Rt. Hon. Freundel Stuart intervened hastily and shocked parents removed their children. On the night in question, the Prime Minister conferred the title of Cultural Ambassador on Robyn 'Rihanna' Fenty.  The only thing the video got right in that blurb was the name of Barbados' Prime Minister.  There was also an article on YourNewsWire.com with the same title and the same quotes written by Baxter Dmitry and posted December 1, 2017.  Loop News was there on site and recorded Rihanna's speech. Honoured, the young Grammy-award winner encouraged children and persons to believe in their dreams and have faith in God.  Rihanna told the crowd which included her friends and family, and numerous dignitaries, that she had no idea how she would get discovered on this little Rock but her dreams started on Westbury New Road, now named Rihanna Drive and she believed in her dreams, so ""believe in your dreams"", as cliche as it may sound.  Rihanna added:  ""I always knew it would happen, I always focused on the result, and that kind of faith, it really was just faith that childlike faith, that even now when I get a little bit discouraged or doubtful, it’s the thing that I go back to, having faith in God, like that even as a child.”  (Photo caption: Rihanna with her head bowed during the opening prayer at the renaming ceremony. (PHOTO: Richard Grimes))  On the fake YouTube video many people in the comments said that the video was a hoax and a lie. People called for the voice clip and video showing Rihanna making that fabricated speech and they asked why the video was missing from all other news agencies.  The ceremony was also broadcast live on TV in Barbados so tens of thousands of Bajans can refute the lies in the video and article aforementioned as well.

The rumor mill has been churning out some misleading information about Barbadian sensation Rihanna. A recent video circulating online, entitled ""Rihanna: 'If Jesus Hasn't Answered Your Prayers, Try Satan,'"" published on the World News Today YouTube Channel on December 2, 2017, has sparked controversy and outrage among Rihanna's fans and followers. The video claims that during a speech at the renaming of a street in Bridgetown, Rihanna made statements that are entirely fabricated and untrue.  According to the video, Rihanna allegedly said, ""If Jesus hasn't answered your prayers, try Satan."" However, this is not what Rihanna actually said during her speech.  The Prime Minister of Barbados, the Rt. Hon. Freundel Stuart, was quick to intervene and address the false claims, confirming that Rihanna did not make any such remarks.  Despite the video's attempts to mislead the public, numerous news outlets were present at the event and captured Rihanna's actual speech, which was entirely innocuous and did not contain any controversial statements.  In fact, Rihanna encouraged the audience, which included her friends and family, and numerous dignitaries, to believe in their dreams and have faith in God. She shared her personal journey and experiences, emphasizing the importance of faith and perseverance in achieving one's goals.  It is important to note that fake news and misinformation can have serious consequences, and it is crucial to verify the authenticity of any information before sharing or believing it. In this case, the facts are clear: Rihanna did not make the statements attributed to her in the fake video, and her actual speech was a heartfelt and inspiring message of hope and encouragement.  As always, it is essential to approach information with a critical and discerning mindset, and to rely on credible sources when sharing or consuming news and information."

gossipcop-4784074017,1,0,"Mila Kunis has no problem blocking out the tabloid noise that gets written about her and her family.  “I don’t read anything about myself,” Kunis told Cosmopolitan. “I genuinely don’t know what’s written about me … other than I know that I’m pregnant about once a year and my husband and I are getting a divorce once a year. I know this because I go down the grocery store aisle, and I see it on the cover of magazines and I’m like, Oh boy, OK!”  Her relatives, however, can’t shake it all off quite as easily as “The Spy Who Dumped Me” star because they’ve often thought some headlines were true.  “The only thing that’s upsetting is my parents and my grandparents sometimes get confused,” she shared. “At one point when I was pregnant, [the tabloids] said that I had an emergency and was rushed to the hospital, and my face was on the cover.  “The amount of stress that caused my family,” she said, “nobody will understand.”  On a lighter note, Kunis, who is a mom to 3-year-old daughter Wyatt and 1-year-old son Dimitri with husband Ashton Kutcher, revealed that her dad always hopes the pregnancy headlines are true.  “He’s always like, ‘Is there really another?'”","she said. “And I’m like, ‘Dad, no!’”
Your rewrite:
Mila Kunis has mastered the art of tuning out the tabloid noise that surrounds her and her family. In an interview with Cosmopolitan, the actress revealed that she doesn't read anything about herself, preferring to remain blissfully unaware of the constant stream of gossip and speculation. ""I genuinely don't know what's written about me,"" she said with a chuckle. ""Other than the fact that I'm pregnant about once a year and my husband and I are getting a divorce about once a year. I know this because I go down the grocery store aisle and see it on the cover of magazines. And I'm like, 'Oh boy, OK!'""
Kunis' relatives, however, are not as immune to the tabloid frenzy. Her parents and grandparents have been known to get confused by the constant barrage of false headlines, leading to unnecessary stress and worry. ""The only thing that's upsetting is my parents and my grandparents sometimes get confused,"" she shared. ""At one point when I was pregnant, they said that I had an emergency and was rushed to the hospital, and my face was on the cover. The amount of stress that caused my family...nobody will understand.""
Despite the chaos that surrounds her, Kunis remains light-hearted about the whole thing. Her father, in particular, takes the pregnancy rumors with a grain of salt. ""He's always like, 'Is there really another?'"" she said with a smile. ""And I'm like, 'Dad, no!'""
In conclusion, Mila Kunis has learned to handle the tabloid noise with grace and humor. By ignoring the gossip and focusing on what truly matters, she has managed to maintain a sense of privacy and tranquility in her life. As for her dad, he'll just have to keep hoping for another little Kunis to arrive anytime soon."

Taking it to that level and unveiling her [new body] with a fully naked photo spread is going way too far.'  Kardashian momager Kris, who is said to have known about Jenner’s surgery in advance, has vowed to stop the shoot from going ahead, according to the insider.  ‘She knew the surgery was inevitable and it was bound to happen,’ said the source. ‘But she says she will do everything in her power to stop the shoot if she can.'  DailyMail.com has approached representatives for Jenner and the Kardashians for comment. Jenner's rep knew nothing about it.  Jenner first announced her transition in an interview with Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July.  The headline-making ‘I am Cait’ shoot was said to have taken the Kardashian clan by surprise at the time and led to tension between Jenner and Kim, 36, as a result.  Nevertheless, the family have been publicly supportive of her decision to transition, which was completed in January according leaked extracts from her memoir.  Jenner wrote of the $20,000 operation: 'The surgery was a success, and I feel not only wonderful but liberated […] I am going to live authentically for the first time in my life.  ‘I am going to have an enthusiasm for life that I have not had in 39 years since the Olympics, almost two thirds of my life.'  But the book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife and step-children.  Sources close to the family told DailyMail.com that Jenner’s ‘unpredictable’ behavior has also played a part in their current estrangement.  The insider said: ‘[The book] is definitely something that she’s wanted to do for a while and it was just a matter of time before she got it done.  ‘But the family were like, it’s probably going to reopen the drama of everything [that has happened].  ‘They were worried because she’s been so unpredictable lately and just trying to get out into the limelight.’  Jenner's book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife  A second leaked extract from the memoir has already proven embarrassing, after Jenner claimed the late Robert Kardashian knew O.J.

The actress has been having a ball at the music festival in Indio, CA this weekend too, but without Orlando. These two are definitely keeping things on the down low and casual!  Orlando just got out of his one-year relationship with singer Katy Perry, 32, in Feb. 2017. He told Elle UK that even though they split up, things did not end badly between them. “We’re all grown up.

Colbert’s slew of frat-boy remarks culminated in a crack that the only thing Trump’s mouth is good for “is being Vladimir Putin’s [expletive] holster.” The naughty word was bleeped in the broadcast, and Colbert’s mouth was pixelated. But, intrepid journalists, who are paid to ferret out the truth, discovered what was the word, and they printed it – minus the offending syllable, of course.  All hell broke loose.  Trump called Colbert “no-talent guy.” Colbert’s monologue was plastered by some as inappropriately vulgar, by others as homophobic. The FCC received thousands of complaints. Reporters breathlessly reported Colbert was under FCC investigation, and a good time was had by all.  Today, however, the FCC put an end to the fun, saying in a statement: “Consistent with standard operating procedure, the FCC’s Enforcement Bureau has reviewed the complaints and the material that was the subject of these complaints.”  “The Bureau has concluded that there was nothing actionable under the FCC’s rules.”  In rough numbers, the FCC was saying that programs airing on broadcast TV stations before 10 PM are subject to fine if the commission determines they are “indecent.” Shows that run in late-night, however, have a different threshold: content must be ruled “obscene” for stations to be fined. FCC defines obscene as content that “must appeal to an average person’s prurient interest; depict or describe sexual conduct in a ‘patently offensive’ way; and, taken as a whole, lack serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.”  Here’s the monologue that launched a thousand complaints:",Note: The word that was bleeped out in the original broadcast was replaced with [expletive] in the passage.

A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Jul 20, 2018 at 11:28am PDT  But while Kim in a bikini isn't exactly breaking news, her caption (read: ""I'm really shy..."") essentially amounts to her trolling herself.

Great minds think alike, Kim and JVN are the best and most self-aware celebs on your Insta feed, etc!  But um, before we go....","Why does Kim Kardashian West always post her racy photos with the hashtag #nomakeup? I mean, the girl is a Kardashian, she could slather on a full face of makeup and still look flawless (I'm not sure she's ever NOT looked flawless, TBH). So why the apparent attempt to convey a sense of 'realness'? Is it just for our benefit, or does she genuinely want us to believe she's just hanging out in her undies without any fancy products? Discuss.  And with that, we conclude this edition of #KimKUpdate! Stay tuned for more of the latest and greatest from the Queen of Instagram.  I am here to rewrite the given passage in a more convincing style. Here is my attempt: Kim Kardashian West is once again proving why she's a social media queen with her latest Instagram post. The reality TV star has returned to doing what she does best: sharing sultry photos of herself in skimpy outfits, and unapologetically owning it. And why should she? Every body is a bikini body, and Kim's looks absolutely stunning in hers.  The caption to her post, which reads ""I'm really shy...,"" is a clear nod to her own self-deprecating humor. It's a clever move that shows Kim's ability to poke fun at herself and her image, all while still commanding attention and admiration from her followers.  But the real question on everyone's mind is: why does Kim always use the hashtag #nomakeup on her racy photos? While it's true that the Kardashian-Jenner clan is known for their flawless beauty, there's something to be said for the apparent authenticity of going au naturel. Is it just for our benefit, or does Kim genuinely want us to believe she's rocking her natural glow without any makeup? Whatever the case, it's clear that Kim Kardashian West is in a league of her own when it comes to social media, and we're all just along for the ride."

gossipcop-9589202718,1,0,"LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) — Blake Griffin’s injury-plagued career will now take him to Detroit after being traded to the Pistons on Monday, and the question of a career decline and a link to a certain celebrity family has surfaced.  The Pistons will send forward Tobias Harris, guard Avery Bradley and center Boban Marjanovic to Los Angeles, with the Clippers also receiving draft picks. Detroit also would receive forward Brice Johnson and center Willie Reed.  The All-Star forward could be looking at a long distance relationship with girlfriend and model Kendall Jenner, sister of Kim and Khloe Kardashian.  RELATED: Blake Griffin Trade Gets Social Media Talking, And He Even Gets In A Classic Comment  Between the Kardashians’ reality show and paparazzi buzzing around, could there really be a Kardashian curse?  Kim and Khloe both married and divorced NBA players who saw better days on the court before marrying into the family, thrusting their lives into the spotlight.  Fan favorite Lamar Odom was traded from the Lakers to the Dallas Mavericks in 2011. His career then went downhill and then he almost died of a drug overdose while married to Khloe.  Kim was married to New Jersey Nets player Kris Humphries for just 72 days. He has played for four different NBA teams since the well-documented brief marriage.","The Pistons will get a proven talent in Griffin, who has averaged 21.5 points, 10.9 rebounds and 4.4 assists over his career.  The deal is expected to be finalized Tuesday.  Please rewrite the passage in a more convincing style.
Rewritten passage:
Blake Griffin's highly publicized and injury-riddled NBA career will now take a new turn as he is set to join the Detroit Pistons, following a Monday trade that will have significant implications for both teams involved. The move comes as a surprise to many, given Griffin's recent struggles with injuries and a perceived decline in his performance on the court. However, the Pistons are hopeful that the All-Star forward will be able to regain his former glory and lead the team to success.
As Griffin embarks on this new chapter in his career, the question of a potential link between his career decline and his high-profile relationship with model and reality TV star Kendall Jenner has raised eyebrows. Jenner, the younger sister of Kim and Khloe Kardashian, has been Griffin's girlfriend for several years, and some have speculated that the constant media attention and scrutiny surrounding their relationship may be taking a toll on Griffin's performance.
While Griffin's career has undoubtedly been affected by his numerous injuries, there is also a longstanding belief among some in the NBA community that there may be a ""Kardashian curse"" at play. This theory suggests that the constant attention and pressure surrounding the Kardashian family's numerous high-profile relationships and marriages may have a negative impact on the men involved, both on and off the court.
While Griffin's trade to the Pistons may be seen as a fresh start for him, it is worth noting that his new team will also be taking on a significant amount of risk. With Griffin's injury history and recent decline in performance, there is a risk that he may not be able to live up to his potential with the Pistons. However, if he is able to regain his form and lead the team to success, it could be a major boost for both the team and Griffin's career.
In any case, the Griffin trade is sure to be a major talking point in the NBA world for the foreseeable future, and fans will be eagerly awaiting his debut with the Pistons. As the deal is expected to be finalized on Tuesday, the excitement and speculation surrounding Griffin's next chapter will only continue to grow."

All she talked about in the interviews was Lion. Had Reese known that Nicole would put the show so far on the back-burner, she would have cast some random person in the show,” Daily Mail quoted a source as saying.  Red carpet roundup: Golden girls at Oscars 2017  In Australia, Big Little Lies‘ debut outranked any HBO series broadcast on Foxtel in a launch week, more than doubling the audience that tuned in to see Game of Thrones‘ first-ever episode.  But New Idea suggests that it’s the underwhelming reception in her own home country that has left Reese disappointed. Reese is one of the executive producers for the show after all.  According to the publication, frosty relations between the pair manifested themselves at the Oscars last month. “You could cut the tension with a knife at the Oscars. Nicole was telling her people to keep Reese away from her,” claimed the source.  News of the pair being involved in “some tense arguments” during filming were also reported by the publication, which alleged that the Hollywood heavyweights may never work together again.  An insider claimed, “If the show doesn’t make any waves or get better ratings, it will probably mark the end of Reese and Nicole’s joint ventures.”  However, a representative of Daily Mail Australia says the story is completely incorrect. “Everyone is thrilled to the back teeth with Big Little Lies. They’re (Reese and Nicole) great friends, they love each other and they love the way each other works.”  Another source has denied New Idea’s claims that Nicole had not been promoting the show as much as fellow cast members, saying that the 49-year-old did a ‘shed load’ of publicity both in America and abroad. The report comes just two months after she spoke about the actresses’ friendship in California. “We’re very, very close friends. We’re able to talk about everything,” she said.

One year ago, Tiffany Haddish, the star of 'She Ready! From the Hood to Hollywood', was eager to take on any role that came her way, including playing a white woman. This desire to diversify her acting portfolio was evident in her recent interview on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, where she expressed her willingness to play any ethnicity. Haddish's commitment to breaking down racial barriers in the entertainment industry is admirable, and her dedication to challenging stereotypes is a breath of fresh air in an industry that has long been criticized for its lack of diversity. As a journalist, I find it inspiring to see Haddish embrace these challenges and push the boundaries of what is possible for actors of color. Her willingness to take on any role, regardless of race, is a testament to her talent and her commitment to her craft. The entertainment industry would benefit greatly from more actors like Haddish, who are unafraid to challenge the status quo and push the envelope. With her unwavering dedication to her craft and her refusal to be limited by societal expectations, Haddish is paving the way for a more inclusive and diverse industry."

The girls were just fans of the DNCE frontman, who graciously posed for photos with them on the sunny shoreline. How sweet!  The “Cake By The Ocean” singer went Down Under to shoot the upcoming season of The Voice Australia, which he will be a celebrity coach on, alongside Delta Goodrem, Kelly Rowland, and Boy George. While his fiancée didn’t make the trip, the couple were able to spend some quality time together before Joe’s excursion to the Southern Hemisphere. Earlier this month, the pair enjoyed a romantic getaway to a private island in the Maldives, and then followed up the vacation with a huge celebration in New York City for Sophie’s 22nd birthday on Feb. 21. Joe’s brother Nick Jonas even commemorated the occasion by giving a sweet shout-out to the birthday girl. He shared a photo from Sophie and Joe’s engagement party in Nov. 2017, and captioned the pic that also included Kevin and Frankie Jonas, “Happy Birthday @sophiet You’re super cool!

While “normal” people are pressured by friends and family to get pregnant, celebrities are pressured by the whole world. And compared to other celebs, nobody has been more publicly pressured than Jennifer Aniston. The world is obsessed with her having a baby!  MORE: JENNIFER ANISTON’S AND JUSTIN THEROUX’S DOG CUSTODY BATTLE  It seems like no one has been reported pregnant more times than Jen.The earliest reports date back to 1999, back when the world first fell in love with her on Friends and she began dating Brad Pitt. Since 1999 there have been more than 55 published articles about her being pregnant both in and outside the U.S. It was even reported by the Huffington Post that despite the possibility that the U.S would go into war “Jennifer Aniston Pregnant” was still searched more than “are we at war” on Google.  Jennifer did express in early interviews that she wanted to become a mother one day and from then on the world was waiting. The obsession with her character on Friends—and the fact that Rachel did get pregnant—could be the reason why fans kept a close eye on is she or isn’t she in real life. In fact, the roles Jennifer took on in her career often had a direct impact on when and how her pregnancy rumors evolved.  Over time the extremity of the rumors changed, but many of the triggers are the same. Rumors start any time she is wearing a loose shirt or looks “bloated,” whenever she is in a new relationship, and whenever that relationship ends. And most importantly, the rumors evolve as she ages.  MORE: JENNIFER ANISTON BANS THE WORD “BABY” AROUND HER  Take a look at almost two decades worth of pregnancy rumors and how they progressed:","2000: The rumors started when Brad and Jen were together, then stopped when they broke up, and started again when she began dating Vince Vaughn. 2004: After her split from Vince, rumors started again after she began dating John Mayer. 2006: After her split from John, rumors started again after she began dating Bradley Cooper. 2010: After her split from Bradley, rumors started again after she began dating Justin Theroux. 2012: The rumors really started to pick up when she starred in Wanderlust and played a character who got pregnant. 2015: After her split from Justin, the rumors started again after she began dating a new man. 2018: The rumors started again after she starred in the Netflix movie Dumplin’ and played a character who got pregnant.  Despite the constant rumors, Jennifer has repeatedly denied she is pregnant. In 2016, she told Ellen DeGeneres that she is not pregnant and that the rumors are “just hilarious to me.”  She added, “I’m not pregnant, I don’t have a baby. I don’t know why people are so obsessed with this.” In 2019, she told Extra TV that she is not pregnant and that she is happy with her life without kids.  It’s important to respect Jennifer’s privacy and not perpetuate the rumors. It’s her decision if she wants to have a baby or not, and it’s not fair to pressure her into something she doesn’t want.  The constant pressure on Jennifer to have a baby is a reflection of the broader societal pressure on women to conform to traditional gender roles and have children. It’s important to challenge these expectations and respect people’s reproductive choices.
Rewritten passage:
It is not uncommon for women to face societal pressure to have children, but for celebrities, the scrutiny is often amplified. Jennifer Aniston is one such example, who has been the subject of pregnancy rumors for over two decades. The constant speculation has led to a culture of obsession, with the world eagerly anticipating the day when she will finally give in and have a baby.
The earliest reports of Jen's pregnancy dates back to 1999, when she was at the height of her Friends fame and dating Brad Pitt. Since then, there have been over 55 published articles on the topic, with some outlets reporting on it more than they did during times of global crisis, such as the Iraq War. The Huffington Post even went so far as to declare that ""Jennifer Aniston Pregnant"" was searched more on Google than ""Are we at war?"" during the height of the conflict.
Jen herself has expressed her desire to become a mother in the future, which has only fueled the speculation. However, she has consistently denied the rumors, telling Ellen DeGeneres in 2016 that she is ""not pregnant, it's just hilarious to me."" She reiterated the same sentiment in 2019, telling Extra TV that she is ""not pregnant, and I'm happy without kids.""
The constant pressure on Jen to conform to traditional gender roles and have children is a reflection of a broader societal issue. It is important to challenge these expectations and respect people's reproductive choices, especially for celebrities who are often subjected to an intense level of scrutiny.
In conclusion, while the constant speculation surrounding Jen's pregnancy may seem harmless, it highlights the broader societal pressure on women to conform to traditional gender roles. It is important to respect Jen's privacy and reproductive choices, and challenge the societal expectations that drive these kinds of rumors."

Following her meeting with the president, Alice, who was sentenced to life in prison without parole in 1997 on money laundering and drug conspiracy charges, was released from Aliceville Correctional Facility in Alabama.  When asked if she would ever run for office, Kardashian told CNN, “I guess never say never.

gossipcop-5077951266,1,0,"The royal wedding is a multi-million dollar affair. Chris Jackson / Getty  The average cost of a wedding for couples in the US and the UK is around $34,000 (£23,700).  Five figures is a huge expense for a one-day affair. That is, unless you're ultra-rich — and especially if you're royalty rich.  Next month, the world will bear witness to the most anticipated royal wedding in years. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are set to be married on May 19 at St. George's Chapel, in Windsor, and will begin a carriage procession immediately after the ceremony. Their reception will take place later on the grounds of Windsor Castle.  Kensington Palace will cover the cost of the wedding, an expense traditionally taken on by the bride's family.  The case was the same for Kate Middleton and Prince William's 2011 royal wedding— the only item Middleton paid for was her six-figure Alexander McQueen dress. Their total wedding celebration cost $34 million (£23.7 million).  Markle and Prince Harry's wedding will reportedly cost in excess of $45.8 million (£32 million), according to Bride Book's estimation. That's over 1,000 more than the average wedding.  The venue is the biggest part of a typical wedding budget for couples in the US and the UK, taking up nearly half of the entire wedding cost. Access to St. George's Chapel — and St. George's Great Hall, where the wedding reception will take place — is free of charge for Markle and Prince Harry. Transportation is also free, thanks to the Queen's fleet of Rolls-Royces, Daimlers, and Bentleys.  The greatest cost for the royal couple? Security. Protecting Markle and Prince Harry, plus thousands of guests and onlookers, will run Kensington Palace a whopping $43 million (£30 million), estimates Bride Book. That includes the cost of snipers, undercover police, military technology, and security drones. The bulk of Kate Middleton and Prince William's wedding budget similarly went to security costs.  Otherwise, Markle and Prince Harry's total wedding spend, including food, cakes, entertainment, wardrobe, and the honeymoon, amounts to about $2.8 million.  Below, check out Bride Book's breakdown of what the royal wedding will cost.","Rewritten passage:  The forthcoming royal wedding between Meghan Markle and Prince Harry is an extravagant affair that will reportedly cost over $45.8 million, according to Bride Book's estimation. This is a staggering amount, more than 1,000% higher than the average wedding cost for couples in the US and the UK, which is around $34,000 (£23,700).  While the average couple may find the cost of a wedding to be a significant expense, for royalty, it is a mere drop in the ocean. The royal family's wealth and status afford them the luxury of spending millions on a single day celebration.  The venue, St. George's Chapel, and St. George's Great Hall, where the reception will take place, are free of charge for the couple, thanks to the generosity of the royal family. However, security costs are a significant portion of the total expenditure, estimated to be $43 million (£30 million). This includes the cost of snipers, undercover police, military technology, and security drones, all of which are necessary to protect the couple, their guests, and the onlookers.  The remaining costs, including food, cakes, entertainment, wardrobe, and the honeymoon, amount to around $2.8 million. While this may seem like a lot to some, it is a small price to pay for the privilege of being a part of such a historic event.  In conclusion, the royal wedding between Meghan Markle and Prince Harry is a true spectacle, with a price tag to match. While the cost may seem exorbitant to some, it is a small price to pay for the opportunity to witness such a momentous occasion."
gossipcop-9362271023,1,0,"(Video provided by Splash News)  The Weeknd instigated his breakup with Selena Gomez, Gossip Cop can confirm. Gomez’s rekindled friendship with Justin Bieber, however, had nothing to do with the rapper’s decision to end his romance with the singer.  As Gossip Cop reported, Gomez and The Weeknd recently split after nearly a year of dating. The pair weren’t seen together much during the summer, though it was later revealed the singer-actress was laying low due to a kidney transplant. Regardless, they still appeared to be going strong in the early fall. Prior to the announcement of their breakup, the status of their relationship was questioned after it emerged Gomez had rekindled her friendship with Bieber. © Gossip Cop (Getty Images)  On Sunday, that speculation swirled as Bieber and Gomez were seen in public and The Weeknd stopped following her friends on social media. That being said, Bieber was allegedly not responsible for the breakup. Rather, it was the challenges of a long-distance relationship, particularly with The Weeknd touring and Gomez’s shooting schedule, that led both the former couple to reconsider their fizzling relationship.  Additionally, contributing to their split, the rapper felt “tied down” in a relationship that had lost its spark. Over time, the pair started talking less frequently on the phone, prompting The Weeknd to end his romance with Gomez, reports TMZ. Despite their breakup, we’re told that the pair are still on good terms and have talked several times since the split.  Predictably, after the rapper ended his relationship with Gomez, Gossip Cop busted the often disproven HollywoodLife for claiming in a made-up report that The Weeknd was “heartbroken” over Gomez reconnecting with Bieber. In the bogus story, the bad blog ridiculously asserted that The Weeknd and Gomez were caught in a “love triangle” with Bieber, but of course, the breakup had nothing to do with and wasn’t caused by the “Love Yourself” singer.

gossipcop-3564164651,1,0,"Caitlyn Jenner is having weird sense of joy these days! Says Cellulite makes her feel more feminine!  Caitlyn Jenner, the TV personality, and a former Olympic gold medal-winning decathlon champion is having a different sense of the quality of expressing her womanhood. She says that the cellulite in her thighs, hips, and tummy is giving her different sense of joy and can’t wait to show it off.  A weird article  The headline “Cellulite Makes Cait Feel So Womanly!” from the National Enquirer/RadarOnline is trending these days. And do you want to know what the article says? You must have some info about this! It said:  Caitlyn Jenner is telling friends she can’t wait to wear a bikini this summer to show off some skin, and her recently acquired cellulite!  That seems really weird, doesn’t it? I mean showing it off in a bikini for what? After all, many people try to hide their cellulite and here Jenner is going to a different path. She is WAITING for the summer just to show it off! Just to remind you, the article also called her a “blabbermouth”. And I don’t think it could be wrong. She blabbering about things that makes no sense. Maybe her excessive talking needed a halt and this quoted name of her may stop her from talking much now. Let’s see what the article had to say other than that. It said:  She has this weird sense of joy when she sees patches of cellulite on her thighs, hips and tummy. The sight of lumpy flesh doesn’t upset her. It makes her feel more feminine!  Maybe Caitlyn is trying to respect her body by respecting what she has. You can’t just disrespect your body for having a lumpy flesh. It is your body after all and if you disrespect it by yourself and obviously you can’t expect respect from others, can you? And who knows, maybe that lumpy dimpled flesh will look really feminine on her. It is creating a buzz in the media as this is not what you hear from a TV personality everyday. After all, every ordinary people might have cellulite in their body. It also said that Jenner’s view: “dimpled feminine flesh as a rite of passage into true womanhood.” and it was also reported that she wouldn’t mind having more cellulite in her body in future. The story features a zoomed-in photo of purported cellulite on Jenner’s leg. Also, after all these years of being a decathlete and going through dieting for years, the 67 year old Jenner might not want to do it anymore. “So let it be!” is what she might have been thinking. Also, the other reason maybe her daughter Kim’s cellulite pictures that surfaced online. This might just be a way to support her daughter.

Pitt is an honorary member of the Epidermolysis Bullosa Medical Research Foundation (EBMRF) that is dedicated to raising money and awareness for the rare skin disorder, epidermolysis bullosa.In January, Pitt introduced singer Chris Cornell during a Rock4EB annual charity to support EBMRF.Further, he revealed in a 2013 Esquire Magazine interview that he self-diagnosed himself with a rare disease – prosopagnosia — also known as face blindness. According to the article, ""Brad Pitt won't remember you. If you've met him, he'll have no idea who you are when he meets you again. Even if you've had what he calls ""a real conversation,"" your face will start fading from his memory as soon as you walk away.""It should be noted that being diagnosed with a condition and being self-diagnosed with a condition can be 2 very different diagnoses.Prosopagnosia refers to the inability to recognize familiar people from their face. They may also be unable to recognize other stimuli, such as objects, cars, or animals.People with prosopagnosia typically learn to use non-face cues including voice, walking style and hairstyle to recognize others.

USA TODAY President Trump in Trump Tower. (Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP) Corrections & Clarifications: A previous version of the story included a tweet from a parody account claiming to Jill Biden. NEW YORK CITY – President Trump's argument Tuesday that left wing groups were just as violent as the white supremacists who staged a demonstration in Charlottesville set off a firestorm of criticism from members of his own party – and raised questions about his personal views of racial tensions in the country. Just one day after Trump sought to tamp down on controversy by condemning white supremacists for their role in racially motivated clashes in the Virginia city, the president appeared to return to his highly criticized initial response that many sides were to blame for the weekend violence. ""What about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, alt-right?"" Trump told reporters in a chaotic impromptu press conference at Trump Tower. ""Do they have any semblance of guilt? What about the fact they came charging with clubs in their hands?"" Trump said he couldn't make a condemnation of hate groups earlier because he didn't ""know all the facts"" about an alleged white nationalist who crashed a car into a crowd of protesters, killing one person and wounded 19 others. CLOSE From Trump Tower in New York City, President Trump told reporters that both sides were to blame for the violence that occurred in Charlottesville, Virginia. USA TODAY ""I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct,"" Trump said from Trump Tower in New York, after an event that was intended to be devoted to a new infrastructure executive order. Trump has been especially quick to denounce previous terrorist attacks, including those taking place overseas. Yet he was notably reticent to pinpoint the blame for one on Saturday that involved white supremacists – a point his critics on both sides of the aisle continued to hammer. ""We must be clear. White supremacy is repulsive. This bigotry is counter to all this country stands for. There can be no moral ambiguity,” said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. added: ""There is only one side to be on when a white supremacist mob brutalizes and murders in America.” Several lawmakers were dismayed the president appeared to equate white supremacists with their opponents. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., tweeted: ""Blaming 'both sides' for #Charlottesville?! No. Back to relativism when dealing with KKK, Nazi sympathizers, white supremacists? Just no."" Another Republican, Rep. Charlie Dent from Pennsylvania, said Trump ""must stop the moral equivalency! AGAIN."" Over the weekend, Trump faced heavy criticism from both Republicans and Democrats for chiding ""many sides"" for their role in the violence in Charlottesville on Saturday, a statement many regarded as tepid toward racists. A full two days later, on Monday, Trump at the White House directly condemned the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists and announced the Justice Department would open up a civil rights investigation into the driver of the car that killed Charlottesville resident Heather Heyer. Yet on Tuesday, amid questions about whether Trump meant the words behind his most recent scripted statement, the president called his initial response ""fine"" and blamed the press for being dishonest in its coverage. ""There was no way of making a correct statement that early,"" he said at one point. ""I had to see the facts. Unlike a lot of reporters – I didn't know (prominent white supremacist) David Duke was there. I wanted to see the facts."" For his part, former KKK leader Duke tweeted a thank you to the president after his statement Tuesday – for condemning ""the leftist terrorists"" in Black Lives Matter and Antifa.","of Robert E. Lee is ""sad."" USA TODAY Trump also addressed criticism from his own party and others who say he is not doing enough to address racial tensions in the country. ""I think it's tremendous, the support I have, the enthusiasm I have, the energy I have,"" Trump said of his base. ""I think it's fantastic."" Trump maintained he was not racist and insisted he had done more for African Americans than previous presidents. ""I think I've been very good to the African American community,"" Trump said, citing his work on criminal justice reform and the economy. Trump also addressed criticism from some in his own party that he has not been forceful enough in condemning white supremacists. ""I think it's sad,"" Trump said of the push to remove Confederate monuments. ""I think it's very sad."" Trump also said that some people view the monuments as a way to remember and honor their ancestors, and that he believes that is an important part of American history. ""I think it's very important to preserve the history of our country,"" Trump said. ""I think it's very important to keep the monuments, the statues, the memorials."" Trump also said that he believes that the United States needs to come together as a country to address racial tensions and that he is willing to work with lawmakers to find a solution. ""I think it's a very, very important issue,"" Trump said. ""I think it's a very, very important issue for the country."" Trump concluded by saying that he believes that the media is not doing enough to help the country come together and address racial tensions. ""I think the media has a big responsibility to try and bring people together,"" Trump said. ""I think they have a big responsibility to try and find common ground."""

After deciding that she just can’t let go of this hunk, Mariah reportedly decided to make it happen – an engagement, that is! “Word is Mariah took matters into her own hands,” a source tells OK! magazine, “It was an unusual proposal but it did the trick. She wrote a song about how she wanted Bryan to be her husband and she performed it for him while wearing a sexy, glitzy gown. Then she explained that she’s ready for them to make their relationship official.”  Bryan gave a “hearty yes,” as the insider says, “He couldn’t believe his luck!” It appears Bryan also thinks he and Mariah belong together, and he always wants to be her baby. These two aren’t waiting around for one sweet day to tie the knot. While love takes time, Mariah and Bryan are already busy making wedding plans. “Mariah would love to get married in May at the Grand Wailea Resort in Maui,” the insider told OK!, “where she and Bryan first went public with their romance.” Mariah and Bryan struck up a relationship in late 2016, with Mariah low-key confirming the romance in February 2017 by calling Bryan her “boyfriend.”  Mariah’s “also toying with the idea of a winter wonderland wedding,” the source says. “After all, she is the queen of Christmas!” Could Mariah have the fantasy holiday wedding she’s always wanted, saying “Thank God I found you” to her honey, her all? Whenever Mariah decides to get married, don’t forget about us when it comes to the wedding invitations!  This alleged engagement would be the third time Mariah walked down the aisle, as she was previously married to Tommy Mottola, 68, and Nick Cannon, 37. After dealing with a pair of heartbreakers, MiMi isn’t fooling around, especially when it comes to her $520 million fortune. She’s working on an ironclad prenup, according to OK! magazine. “She’s had tow failed marriages already,” the source says. “She’s not going to take any risks here.” Speaking of Nick, expect to see him during Mariah’s big day.  Nick and Mariah’s twins – son Morocco and daughter Monroe, 6 – will be featured in his wedding, and sources say Mariah’s thinking of asking Nick to walk her down the aisle. “[He] will always be a big part of her life,” the source added. Considering Mariah, Nick and the twins recently made an adorable appearance at the 2018 Kids’ Choice Awards, it makes total sense that Mariah’s ex would be on hand to see her say “I Do” again.","The insider also claims that Mariah’s eager to start a family with Bryan and is considering freezing her eggs. “She’s been talking about it nonstop,” the source says. “She wants to have kids with Bryan, and she’s been exploring her options.” As the songstress is 47, it makes sense that she’d want to take matters into her own hands.  Mariah Carey and Bryan Tanaka's reported engagement is sending shockwaves through the celebrity world. The singer and her beau have been together for a year, and sources say they're ready to take their relationship to the next level.

Here is a possible rewrite of the passage:
Nicole Kidman, the renowned actress, is facing criticism for her alleged inability to complete tasks, according to a recent publication. According to an unnamed source in the entertainment industry, the 50-year-old actress has been struggling to keep up with her responsibilities, causing frustration for those around her.
The source claims that Kidman's flakiness has become a consistent issue, with even the simplest tasks seeming to elude her. For instance, she has been known to start a phone conversation with her husband, Keith Urban, only to forget about him while she attends to other matters. This lack of follow-through has allegedly become a recurring problem, leading to difficulties in completing film projects and keeping appointments.
The couple has yet to respond to the claims made by the publication, leaving the industry to speculate about the validity of the allegations.

Jackman even described the process that goes into the filming of shirtless scenes, which he said involves drinking ten liters of water a day in the months leading up to the scenes, which he said are accomplished through dehydration.  “It’s sort of unbelievable to me, what I did for seventeen years,” Jackman revealed. “The first one, I thought you could get into shape in three weeks. The director pushed all the ‘shirt off’ scenes to the very end.”  “You stop drinking water about 30 hours before you shoot,” Jackman said, explaining the process. “You lose ten pounds of water weight.”  But now that that’s over, Jackman is already enjoying himself.  “Now I’m eating and loving it,” Jackman told Colbert. “Sometimes waking up at two in the morning just to have breakfast cereal, and then go back to bed.”  “With it still in my lap,” he added.  One of us! One of us! One of us!  Logan is in theaters now.  (Last Updated )","It's important to note that Hugh Jackman is still in his prime physical condition, and there's no indication that he will gain weight or become ""fat"" anytime soon. The question posed by Stephen Colbert was likely meant as a joke, and Hugh Jackman's response was a lighthearted and humorous way of addressing the topic. The actor has always been known for his dedication to his craft and his commitment to staying in top physical condition for his roles, and it's clear that he takes pride in his fitness and health.  The passage rewritten in a more convincing style:  Hugh Jackman sat on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, looking sharp and fit as ever. Colbert had a playful question for the actor, one that had been on many people's minds: now that he's finished playing Wolverine, will we finally get to see ""fat Jackman""?  Jackman chuckled at the query, his deep voice filled with amusement. ""Well, I think I've earned a little bit of a break after seventeen years of staying in peak physical condition for these shirtless scenes,"" he said, his eyes glinting with mischief.  The actor then went on to explain the grueling process he had to go through to achieve the ripped physique required for his iconic role. He spoke of the months of intense training, the strict diet, and the dehydration process that allowed him to lose ten pounds of water weight in just 30 hours before shooting.  But despite the challenges, Jackman seemed to be savoring the freedom of no longer having to adhere to such a strict regimen. ""It's been a wild ride, but I'm enjoying the freedom of not having to worry about being shirtless all the time,"" he said, a twinkle in his eye.  ""Now I can eat and sleep whenever I want, and it's a beautiful thing,"" he added, his voice filled with a sense of contentment.  As he finished his interview, Jackman's smile grew wider, and he leaned in, his eyes sparkling with mirth. ""But don't worry, folks, I'm still in my prime. You'll just have to wait and see what other projects I have up my sleeve,"" he teased, before sauntering off the stage, leaving Colbert and the audience in stitches.  In conclusion, Hugh Jackman is still in top physical condition, and there's no sign of him gaining weight or becoming ""fat"" anytime soon. His dedication to his craft and commitment to staying fit for his roles are well-known, and it's clear that he takes pride in his fitness and health. While the question posed by Stephen Colbert was meant as a joke, Jackman's lighthearted and humorous response showed that he's still enjoying the freedom of no longer having to adhere to such a strict regimen."

Gossip Cop can exclusively bust this claim. We’re told it “never happened.”  © Gossip Cop (Getty Images)  According to Life & Style, Maguire recently spotted the La La Land star at the swanky Hollywood hotel. A so-called “source” tells the magazine, “He was checking her out a lot, hoping she’d notice him.” The outlet’s dubious insider goes on to say that the actor eventually approached her, and began “showering her with cheesy compliments, telling her how all of Hollywood was in love with her.”  The magazine’s “source” then purports that Stone “didn’t seem interested in him,” but she “finally gave him her number and suggested meeting up for coffee, then ran off.” The supposed insider adds, “It was pretty obvious she was blowing him off.”  Gossip Cop, however, checked in with a reliable source close to the actor, who exclusively tells us the tabloid’s entire account of events is made-up and simply “never happened.” Unfortunately, we’re not surprised that Life & Style published this completely fictitious story. Gossip Cop previously busted the outlet for falsely alleging Eva Mendes was jealous of Stone’s friendship with Ryan Gosling. There was no truth to that claim, and the same goes for this latest one.","So, there you have it: yet another phony story from a magazine that can’t be trusted. The actor and the actress involved are not involved in any romantic pursuit, and the tabloid has been caught spreading false information yet again."

It happened with Brad and Angelina – so Jen can’t help but think history is repeating itself,’ the insider says.

Emma has obviously chosen to side with Justin after the whole split, which is very telling to Jen considering that she’s been friends with Emma.  ‘She just wants to know when their hook-ups started – they looked so cosy and happy on their date, like this definitely wasn’t their first night out,’ the source continues.  ‘Jen just feels completely humiliated, like she’s being played for a fool – and she doesn’t like it one little bit.’  Jen and Justin called it quits in February this year and he has stayed friends with Emma since.  Justin even posted the two of them hanging out onto his Instagram, but he was quick to declare they were ‘just friends’.

The former Real Housewife of New York, ran around the grounds in an A-line Carolina Herrera dress, posing on the step-and-repeat, taking photos with fans, and catching up with old friends. Trying to track her down for an interview turned into a scavenger hunt.  Scattered around the lawn were tables for vendors selling everything from wine to sex toys. There was a station for guests to get a vitamin infusion, with seats in the direct line of the sun transforming the spot into an inescapable sauna-I.V. drip hybrid. Housewives from across the country flew into town for the occasion (Vicki Gunvalson of Orange County and LeeAnne Locken of Dallas), which also served as a benefit for Thyroid Cancer Research in honor of Zarin’s late husband, Bobby, who died of the disease in January.  Upon first try to flag Zarin down for a couple of questions, she sent over her daughter, Ally Shapiro, in her stead. Shapiro reflected on last year’s luncheon, when her stepfather was still struggling with cancer, but encouraged her and her mother to party on.  “He loved drinking and partying. This was the highlight of his year,” she said. “It was this time last year that we were told he wasn’t gonna make it another week, and he pushed us and he said, ‘Go to the party. Maybe I won’t be here when you come back, but go.’”  Shapiro, who now lives in London while she works on her master’s degree, admits that she can’t watch old episodes of Real Housewives, which showed her as 14-year-old struggling to get close to her stepfather. “You want to think that it’s like a home movie, but it’s not. That’s not what our relationship was like,” she said, adding that the reruns play constantly in the U.K. “I’m walking down the street and someone’s like, ‘Oh my God, I just saw you trying on a prom dress!’”  She also said that her mother is dabbling with dating, specifically with a man she plays tennis with. “It’s fun, and I live in London so it’s good for her to have a distraction.”  Dina Lohan, dressed in a metallic green blazer and shorts set and a pair of oversized aviators, arrived fashionably late to the affair, but was immediately greeted by hoards of people trying to chat her up or get a photo. Eventually secured in the same spot for more than a few seconds, she was willing to talk about her daughter Lindsay’s upcoming project for MTV, a Vanderpump Rules–inspired reality show that follows Lindsay and the employees of her new Lohan Beach Club. Bunim/Murray Productions is producing the series, the same company that produced Lohan’s E! reality show Living Lohan a decade ago.  “These kids were like, babies, and now they’re running the show,” she said of the crew. “They lived in my house! And now they’re all corporate. . . . We’re home. It’s cyclical, you know.”  Lohan also revealed that the upcoming series is a bit of a family affair with Lindsay’s younger sister, 24-year-old Ali, providing the theme song.  A friend of Lohan’s interjected, asking if Ali, like her older sister over a decade ago, had moved out to L.A. for work.  “She’s in New York with me,” the matriarch answered. “I keep them close! I’m not going to lose someone to L.A., no. Not again!”  Finally, the woman of the hour managed to stop and take a breath. While Zarin may no longer be a Bravo housewife, she still knows how to schmooze like one. She’s been keeping up with the latest season of the show here and there, and even received a good-luck message from Luann de Lesseps, who checked into rehab earlier in the month, wishing her good luck on the event. Having brought me up to speed, Zarin closed our conversation with a plug for her new line of “pet-proof, gorgeous, and inexpensive” rugs, aptly titled Jill Zarin Rugs.

gossipcop-7384566778,1,0,"Kylie Jenner may have skipped out on the 2017 Kardashian Christmas card, but she did attend mom Kris Jenner’s annual Christmas Eve party in Los Angeles.  The 20-year-old cosmetics guru — who is expecting her first child, a baby girl, with boyfriend Travis Scott — did not appear in any photos from the bash shared to social media by KarJenner family members. But a source tells PEOPLE she was there celebrating away from the cameras.  “Kylie looked great but didn’t really draw any attention to her baby bump,” the source says. “She still acts like she wants to keep her pregnancy private.”  Meanwhile, her sister Khloé Kardashian, — who earlier this week confirmed that she and boyfriend Tristan Thompson are expecting their first child together — accentuated her own baby bump in a skin-tight, sparkly jumpsuit with a white fur coat.  “Khloé was beaming all night,” the insider says of the 33-year-old Revenge Body host. “She kept touching and showing off her cute baby belly.”  Khloé showed off her bump on Instagram as well.  “Merry Christmas!! May you sparkle and shine this festive season, may all of your wishes and dreams come true,” Khloé captioned a gallery of shots showing her touching her belly. “I pray that we all may feel this happiness all year round. God bless you! ✨ #BabyBump🤗”  “Merry Christmas!!!!! Wishing all of you and your families much Joy Happiness Peace and Health…” Kris added in her own post, a photo of her and Khloé alongside Kendall Jenner. “Love you guys!!!!!!!! #christmas #blessed #ohholynight.”  Kim Kardashian West, Kris Jenner and Khloé Kardashian Khloe Kardashian/Instagram  Khloé Kardashian and Scott Disic Khloe Kardashian/Instagram  Aside for Khloé and Kendall, Kris’ party also brought together siblings Kim Kardashian West (who’s expecting her third child, via a surrogate), Kourtney Kardashian, and their kids: Kim’s daughter North, 4, and son Saint, 2; and Kourtney son Reign, 3, daughter Penelope, 5, and son Mason, 8.  Kourtney’s ex-boyfriend Scott Disick was there, too — without girlfriend Sofia Richie.  “He mingled, looked good and didn’t drink,” the source says, adding that there wasn’t any awkwardness with Kourtney’s new boyfriend Younes Bendjima.  “Kourtney seemed so happy that Younes joined her,” the insider says. “They are so cute together. He kept bringing her drinks and doting on her. Younes fits right into the family. He didn’t seem uncomfortable that Scott was there. They said hello, but that was it. It was very civil.”  Other guests included Kim’s husband Kanye West, celebrity hair stylists Jen Atkin and Chris Appleton, singer Christina Aguilera and Keeping Up with the Kardashians executive producer Ryan Seacrest. Kris appeared to be in a good mood throughout the night, dancing with Kim and Khloé and playing MC while Babyface, Toni Braxton and Brian McKnight performed.  “Everyone had the most amazing time,” the source tells PEOPLE. “Kris always throws the best parties. It was all gorgeous. There was no drama.”  Rob Kardashian and Khloé Kardashian Khloe Kardashian/Instagram  Kylie Jenner and Khloé Kardashian Khloe Kardashian/Instagram  On Christmas morning, the family gathered at Kourtney’s house to open presents and celebrate the holiday in matching elf-patterned onesies and beanies.  “Merry Christmas! People think you weren’t there last night,” Khloé said to Kylie, 20, in one Snapchat video as the younger sister replied: “I was.”  “She’s a secret little bunny,” Khloé teased.

The Kylie Cosmetics owner has kept out of the public eye by sticking close to her house in Calabasas. As a source told PEOPLE in October, “Kylie wants to keep a low profile.”  “She feels good, but her body is changing,” the source continued. “She doesn’t want to be photographed. At the moment, she wants more privacy. She has family and friends come to her house instead so she has compan","ions and doesn’t feel so lonely.”  Meanwhile, Kylie’s younger sister, Kendall Jenner, has been spotted out and about in L.A. and has also been keeping a low profile.  The 21-year-old model has not confirmed any pregnancy news either.  “Kendall is very happy and excited about her new baby,” a source previously told PEOPLE. “She’s been spending a lot of time with her mom and sisters and is looking forward to starting a family of her own.”  Kendall’s boyfriend, Blake Griffin, has also been supportive of the model’s decision to keep her pregnancy private.  “Blake is amazing and very supportive of Kendall’s decision to keep her pregnancy private,” a source previously told PEOPLE. “He’s been helping her in every way possible and is very excited to start a family with her.”  As for Kylie, the source adds that she’s “very excited” to become a mom and is “doing well” in her pregnancy.  “Kylie is going to be a great mom,” the insider says. “She’s already a great aunt to North and Saint.”  Now, keep reading for more details on the Kardashian-Jenner family’s Christmas celebrations.

gossipcop-3329043708,1,0,"'Khloe is not a Kardashian': TWO of her father's ex-wives claim he expressed doubts over the paternity of the youngest sister  Father Robert's ex-wives allege he said she wasn't his child  Khloe hits out at wives on Twitter calling them 'disgusting' and 'low'  Mum Kris has admitted to affairs during marriage to late lawyer    More drama erupted for Kim Kardashian and her family, as the ex-wife of her late father today claimed Kim's sister Khloe was not his daughter.    Two of Robert Kardashian's ex-wives have come forward saying he confided in them that he was unsure of the paternity of the now-27-year-old.  Jan Ashley, who married the businessman after Khloe's mother Kris Jenner, said: 'Khloe is not his kid -- he told me that after we got married.'  And Ellen Pierson, 63, who married Robert in 2003 just two months before his death, has also come forward after eight years of silence to 'tell the truth' about the Kardashian family.  Claims: Two of Robert Kardashian's ex-wives have come forward claiming the lawyer told them Khloe Kardashian, left, was not his real daughter, like older sisters Kim and Kourtney  The reality star has hit back at the claims, calling them 'really low'.  In an explosive interview with Star magazine, Ashley said: 'He just kind of looked at me and said [it] like it was a matter of fact. He said ""Well, you know that Khloe's not really a Kardashian, don't you?""    'And I said… ""OK"" and that was it.'  She claims Khloe, who is married to Dallas Mavericks basketballer Lamar Odom, knew she had a different father to her sisters and younger brother Rob.  'Khloe brought it up all the time. She looked nothing like the rest. She was tall, had a different shape, light hair, curly hair. Didn't look anything like the other three children.'  Different: Khloe has often pointed out that she looks nothing like her older sisters and their mother Kris, far right, said once people asked whether she was 'the milkman's child'  Fighting back: Khloe has responded to the claims today on Twitter She said Robert, who is of Armenian descent, had told her that he and Kris were not sleeping together at the time Khloe was conceived. '[But] he never would have considered a DNA test. He loved her very much. Robert did question the fact that Khloe was his,' Ellen said. 'Any normal man would if they knew their wife had cheated on him.' Khloe has responded to the claims today on Twitter.  Daddy's little girl: Robert Kardashian, pictured with Khloe as a child, referred to having four biological children in court documents filed in 1999 She wrote: 'The audacity you have to mention my father’s name like this! Should be ashamed of urself! I let a lot of things slide but this one is really low… YOU ARE DISGUSTING! (yes you know who YOU are).'    High-profile: Robert represented O.J. Simpson in his murder trial in 1994  Kris, 56, recently admitted in her new book that she cheated on Robert during their marriage.  Since Robert's death, Ellen had experienced financial difficulties, filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2010.  The home she and Robert shared in Indian Wells, California, was sold after going into foreclosure in October.  Kris remarried Olympian Bruce Jenner in 1991 and the couple had two daughters, Kendall and Kylie.  Bruce already had four children from two previous marriages: Burt, Casey, Brody, and Brandon.    Khloe is often talking about how she looks nothing like her sisters, and Kris has been quoted as saying people asked her whether she was 'the milkman's daughter' when she was born.    On Khloe's blog in June 2010, she shared a number of pictures of her and the attorney.  She wrote: 'Father’s Day is two days away, so in preparation I wanted to post this photo album (mostly old school pics) dedicated to my dad and to Bruce.  'I was seriously the luckiest girl in the world growing up because I had two amazing dads who not only loved us kids more than anything, but adored each other as well.  'My dad and Bruce were always really cl","ued in and supportive of each other’s parenting styles, and they always put the kids first.  'They had this great dynamic where they would bounce ideas off each other, and it was really cool to see.  'I’m so grateful to have had them in my life.  'Happy Father’s Day to both of them!

gossipcop-5865271192,1,0,"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired. T","ellingly, the Radar report about the supposed Foxx-Holmes wedding claims the two had planned to wed in a lavish ceremony “in front of 100 guests, including Suri and Tom Cruise’s ex-wife, Nicole Kidman.”  Holmes and Foxx have remained mum on the reports, though the actress has been spotted out and about looking glamorous and happy."

For some celebrities, this would not be a big deal — some stars get pregnant and do not say a word, even as “sources” and “insiders” dish to the tabloids, as illustrated above. For someone in the Kardashian-Jenner family, this is especially confusing.

During the fun-filled evening, Foxx and friends joined Ludacris onstage to perform one of the rapper’s biggest hits, “Move Bitch.”  RELATED: Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes Step Out Separately After Denying Rumors About Their Relationship  Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx Kevin Mazur/Getty Images  Though the Beat Shazam host and Dawson’s Creek star, 39, first being seen dancing with one another in the Hamptons in 2013, have never confirmed their relationship, they’ve been stepping out more often since a photographer captured a rare photo of the pair together, walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach in September.  They also sat together at Clive Davis’ Pre-Grammy Awards Gala in January, played basketball together on Valentine’s Day and were seen leaving Nobu restaurant in New York City on April 22, followed by Carbone on May 1.","“Katie and Jamie are still good friends and enjoy each other’s company, but they’re not in a relationship,” a source close to the actress told PEOPLE earlier this year. “They’re just taking it slow and not ready to get back into dating yet.”  Foxx and Holmes’ rep did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment.  Holmes, 41, was previously married to Tom Cruise from 2006 to 2012.  In conclusion, this passage is a rewritten version of the original passage with a more convincing tone. The language used is more formal and professional, and the tone is more serious and informative. The passage still conveys the same information as the original, but in a more polished and convincing manner."

gossipcop-5745570521,1,0,"There are reports that Taylor Swiftis trying to rekindle her relationship with ex-boyfriend Jake Gyllenhaal. OK! Magazine is reporting that the ""Wildest Dreams"" singer has been contacting her ex ever since he has been in New York City starring in the Broadway show called Sunday in the Park With George.  The tabloid is reporting that a source is saying that Taylor is the one reaching out to the actor since she feels she is now more mature than she was when they dated back in 2010.  The source said, “Taylor was so young when they dated, she wasn’t ready for a serious relationship, but now she’s showing Jake how much she’s matured. She’s excited to see where things go.”  In 2015, a rumor swirled around saying that the stars were in contact with each other, even though she was dating Calvin Harris at the time.  An unidentified source told Star magazine that, “He said he owed Taylor an apology for how things ended between them. In June, Jake ran into Cara Delevingne at The Graham Norton Show and asked for Taylor’s new number. They’ve kept in touch, albeit secretly, ever since.""  This would all be so ironic since Taylor allegedly wrote the hit song ""We Are Never Getting Back Together"" from her Red album about the relationship after her ex's friend asked her if they were giving their relationship a second chance.  “This guy walks in who is a friend of my ex’s and starts talking about how he’s heard we’re going to get back together. And that was not the case. So I start telling them the story: break up, get back together, break-up, get back together — just, ugh, the worst! And I picked up the guitar and (songwriting partner Max Martin) said, ‘This is what we’re writing,’” she once revealed to GMA.  The lyrics in the track said: ""I'm really gonna miss you picking fights / And me falling for it screaming that I'm right / And you would hide away and find your peace of mind / With some indie record that's much cooler than mine.""  In the video for the song, the actor who plays the singer's love interest gives her a scarf which many thought to be a clue that revealed the song was about Jake since she had been photographed wearing one of his scarfs while they were dating.  Since Taylor is now single and so is Jake and they both happen to be living in the same city, we don't see how this could be a problem. There is no confirmation that this is actually happening though and a source close to them told Gossip Cop that there was ""no truth"" to the report.  Do you think Taylor should get back together with Jake? Tell us in the comments.","Rewritten passage:
According to recent reports, Taylor Swift may be considering rekindling her romance with her former boyfriend, Jake Gyllenhaal. Sources close to the singer claim that she has been in contact with the actor since he arrived in New York City to star in the Broadway production of Sunday in the Park With George. It is believed that Taylor is reaching out to Jake due to her increased maturity since their previous breakup in 2010. A source revealed that Taylor is eager to explore the possibility of rekindling their relationship, stating, ""Taylor was so young when they dated, she wasn’t ready for a serious relationship, but now she’s showing Jake how much she’s matured. She’s excited to see where things go.""
The rumors of Taylor and Jake's possible reconciliation have been circulating since 2015, when an unidentified source claimed that the two had been secretly keeping in touch. The source alleged that Jake had asked for Taylor's new phone number after running into her friend, Cara Delevingne, at The Graham Norton Show.
Interestingly, Taylor's hit song ""We Are Never Getting Back Together"" from her Red album is believed to be about her relationship with Jake. In an interview with Good Morning America, the singer revealed that the song was inspired by a conversation with her ex's friend, who suggested that they might give their relationship another chance. The lyrics of the song, which include lines such as ""I'm really gonna miss you picking fights / And me falling for it screaming that I'm right"" and ""You would hide away and find your peace of mind / With some indie record that's much cooler than mine,"" seem to confirm that the song was indeed about Jake.
Despite the speculation, a source close to Taylor and Jake has denied any truth to the report, stating that there is ""no truth"" to the rumors. However, given Taylor's history of penning songs about her past loves, it is possible that she may be considering revisiting her relationship with Jake.
In conclusion, while there is no confirmation on the status of Taylor and Jake's relationship, it is clear that the two have a history together that may be worth exploring. Only time will tell if they will decide to give their romance another chance. Do you think Taylor and Jake should get back together? Share your thoughts in the comments below."

As for the wedding itself, Angelina’s reportedly taking her closest friends and family to Cambodia, “her second home,” for a traditional Buddhist ceremony, according to the source.

On last Sunday’s BET awards, it was quite clear that Jay-Z and Beyonce were not buddy, buddy with Kim Kardashian. In fact, the camera caught Jay barely acknowledge Kim when he was going on stage to accept his award with Kanye West. Since Jay and Kanye are not only music collaborators but close friends, will “Kimye” stand a chance?  Unfortunately, Kim cannot make Kanye’s friends like her. It will be Kanye’s responsibility to lay the law down with his buddies. He must let it be known that high school bully behavior toward his girlfriend is unacceptable.  If his friends continue to snub her, then the rap star will have to distance himself from his friends until they realize he and Kim are a package deal.  Although Jay-Z and Beyonce have preconceived notions of what Kim and the Kardashians are all about, they do not actually know who Kim is.  If they take off their judgmental glasses, they may even come to like her or at least tolerate her in their group.  Remember, if a friend is happy with their new significant other, don’t hate.

There are no doubts about the passion and tenacity of Kimye, but the love affair of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West may have some challenges to overcome.  In the recent BET awards, the body language of Jay-Z and Beyonce suggested they were not in the mood to make amends with their long-time friend, Kim.  As Kanye's closest friends and collaborators, Jay and Beyonce's disregard for Kim raises a question about the longevity of the relationship between the two couples.  It is difficult to say whether Kimye can overcome the cold shoulder given by Jay and Beyonce. However, it is important to recognize that friends can either kill or make a love affair.  Ultimately, it will be up to Kanye to address the issue with his friends and make them understand that their behavior towards Kim is unacceptable. If Jay and Beyonce continue to disregard Kim, it may be necessary for Kanye to distance himself from his friends until they realize that his relationship with Kim is a priority.  While Jay and Beyonce may have preconceived notions about the Kardashians, they should not let those notions cloud their judgment. By taking off their judgmental glasses, they may discover that they actually like Kim or at least tolerate her in their group.

It wasn’t so bad on the scale of celebrity breakups, but after less than three years of marriage (a lifetime in Hollywood), it was a tabloid downer for a day or two.  In case there are still people busying themselves wondering if Aniston is happy (just a note, she really doesn’t want you to), please stop. According to the latest tabloid reports, she’s doing just fine. She’s reportedly back on the dating scene with two different beaus, per Us Weekly, and her friends are having trouble not talking about it. One man is reportedly a bachelor who recently split from his wife and the other is an “industry creative,” whatever that ever means. Neither of them is an actor.  But there’s no reason to believe we’ll learn more anytime soon. In July of 2016, Aniston wrote a pretty searing op-ed for HuffPost in which she scolded paparazzi that are constantly obsessed with whether she’s in love or having babies.  “For the record, I am not pregnant,” she wrote then. “What I am is fed up. I’m fed up with the sport-like scrutiny and body-shaming that occurs daily under the guise of ‘journalism,’ the ‘First Amendment,’ and ‘celebrity news.’”  O.K., so, Jennifer Aniston is happy. She’s dating. This is great. Now time to leave her alone and talk about the fact that Justin Theroux knows someone in the South of France with a really great hot tub.

Here's how I would rewrite the passage to make it more convincing:  Remember the day when Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux announced their unexpected split, just a week after Architectural Digest featured a stunning spread of their midcentury modern Los Angeles home in its pages? It was a brief moment of sadness in the whirlwind world of celebrity breakups, but for those who have long admired Aniston's unwavering commitment to her privacy and personal boundaries, it was a welcome reminder that even the most seemingly flawless of celebrities face the same struggles as the rest of us.  In the days that followed, tabloids breathlessly reported on Aniston's supposed new romantic interests, with Us Weekly claiming that she was ""back on the market"" with two different suitors. But for those who know Aniston's history of shunning the spotlight and protecting her privacy, it's clear that she will not be swayed by the constant scrutiny and speculation that comes with being a public figure.  It's worth remembering that in July of 2016, Aniston penned a powerful op-ed for HuffPost in which she addressed the constant barrage of questions about her personal life, writing, ""For the record, I am not pregnant. What I am is fed up. I’m fed up with the sport-like scrutiny and body-shaming that occurs daily under the guise of ‘journalism,’ the ‘First Amendment,’ and ‘celebrity news.’""  Now, as Aniston navigates this latest chapter in her life, it's important to respect her privacy and allow her the space she craves. After all, as she so eloquently put it in that op-ed, ""I am not a commodity to be bought or sold, and I will not be reduced to a headline or a soundbite.""  So, let us take a cue from Aniston's unwavering commitment to her privacy and personal boundaries, and let her be.

(The marriage was annulled.) In the 24 years since then, he has been sued multiple times for inappropriate sexual contact with a minor (he settled out of court every time), and he was eventually charged with creating child pornography. (A jury found him not guilty on the grounds that they could not conclusively identify the other figure in his infamous sex tape as a child.) Last summer, he was accused of creating an abusive “sex cult” of very young women, whom he allegedly isolates, brainwashes, and abuses physically and emotionally. Since the story broke, multiple women have added their own testimonies of abuse at R. Kelly’s hands. (Through a lawyer, Kelly denied all accusations, saying he would “work diligently and forcibly to pursue his accusers and clear his name.”) And in April, another woman accused Kelly of “knowingly and intentionally infecting her with an STD.” Her lawyers say they are currently preparing a federal civil lawsuit. Through a spokesperson, Kelly issued a statement to the Washington Post in which he “categorically denies all claims and allegations.” As man after man has fallen to the #MeToo reckoning, losing jobs and retiring from public life after being accused of sexual harassment and assault, there’s been a recurring whisper: What about R. Kelly? Despite decades of lawsuits and allegations, Kelly’s career has marched steadily on. Last year, he finished an arena tour with a few cancellations. This year, he’s touring with singer Charlie Wilson (some protests are planned). His music appeared in Pitch Perfect 3. At this year’s Coachella, rapper Vince Staples repeatedly referred to Kelly as a “child molester” in an interview with Complex, insisting, “He pees on people.” In our post-#MeToo, post-Time’s Up, post-Harvey Weinstein world, and given the sheer volume of allegations against Kelly, it seems reasonable to raise the question of why he continues to work as much as he does. But Staples’s interviewer only giggled nervously and protested, “We can’t ever talk about this guy. ... You’re about to get me fired from Coachella. It’s my first time here.” Later, Staples tweeted that “R. Kelly people is looking for me.” ladies and gentlemen, vince staples on r kelly pic.twitter.com/SmZdYu9PNJ — andy (@aboynamedandy) April 16, 2018 That stasis may be starting to change. Most of the claims against Kelly were reiterated in a recent BBC Three documentary, R Kelly: Sex, Girls & Videotapes. And over the past year, at least five members of Kelly’s inner circle have left him. His assistant, his accountant, his lawyer, and his rep have all said that they no longer work for him, although none of them have gone into detail about their departures and all have been supportive and complimentary toward Kelly in their statements. His longtime musical accompanist, DJ Phantom, was less circumspect about his decision to leave Kelly in December: “I didn’t know then what I know now,” he said. “He’s a shitbag.” In April, the Women of Color committee within Time’s Up threw its weight behind the #MuteRKelly campaign, calling for anyone currently profiting from Kelly and his music to drop him, including Spotify, Ticketmaster, and Kelly’s record label, RCA. Shortly thereafter, Spotify announced that it would no longer be promoting Kelly’s music, although his music would remain in their streaming catalog. It’s possible that these new developlments mean things are changing for Kelly, and that he’s about to face lasting consequences for those accusations. But if that’s the case, those consequences took more than two decades to reach him. There is a persistent vagueness to the way we talk about R. Kelly that makes it possible to forget exactly what he’s been accused of, how often he’s been accused, and how much proof there is against him. And most likely, that’s because his alleg","by defendant’s actions.” December 1999: R. Kelly settles suit with 17-year-old fan over sexual relationship In 1999, a 17-year-old girl in Texas claimed that Kelly had a sexual relationship with her starting when she was 14. She sued him for sexual assault, but the case was settled out of court. The settlement agreement is sealed. 2001: R. Kelly settles suit with 15-year-old fan over sexual relationship In 2001, a 15-year-old girl in Florida claimed that Kelly had a sexual relationship with her starting when she was 13. She sued him for sexual assault, but the case was settled out of court. The settlement agreement is sealed. 2002: R. Kelly settles suit with 16-year-old fan over sexual relationship In 2002, a 16-year-old girl in Illinois claimed that Kelly had a sexual relationship with her starting when she was 14. She sued him for sexual assault, but the case was settled out of court. The settlement agreement is sealed. 2008: R. Kelly is accused of taping sexual encounter with underage girl In 2008, a Chicago Sun-Times columnist named Jim DeRogatis received a VHS tape that he believed showed Kelly having sex with an underage girl. He turned the tape over to the authorities, but no charges were filed. DeRogatis later reported that he had spoken to multiple sources who claimed to have seen the tape and confirmed that it was Kelly on the tape. 2015: R. Kelly is charged with criminal sexual assault In 2015, Kelly was charged with criminal sexual assault after a 27-year-old woman alleged that he had sexually assaulted her when she was 16. The woman, who is now 28, said that she had met Kelly at one of his concerts in 2003 and that he had taken her to his home in Atlanta, where he sexually assaulted her. Kelly denied the allegations and was released on bail. In 2016, a jury found him not guilty on the grounds that they could not conclusively identify the other figure in his infamous sex tape as a child. 2017: R. Kelly accused of creating abusive sex cult In 2017, multiple women came forward with allegations that Kelly had created an abusive “sex cult” of very young women, whom he allegedly isolated, brainwashed, and abused physically and emotionally. One of the women, Jocelyn Savage, appeared in a video message saying that she was being held against her will and that Kelly had sexually assaulted her. Another woman, Azriel Clary, said that she had been in a relationship with Kelly for seven years and that he had sexually assaulted her and isolated her from her family. In a statement to the Washington Post, Kelly denied all accusations, saying he would “work diligently and forcibly to pursue his accusers and clear his name.” 2018: R. Kelly accused of infecting woman with STD In April 2018, a woman named Lisa Van Allen accused Kelly of infecting her with a sexually transmitted disease (STD). She said that she had met Kelly in 1995 and that he had had sex with her without telling her that he had the STD. Van Allen’s lawyer said that they were preparing a federal civil lawsuit against Kelly. In response, Kelly issued a statement through a spokesperson denying the allegations and saying that he “categorically denies all claims and allegations.” 2018: R. Kelly’s music is pulled from Spotify After the #MeToo reckoning, Spotify announced that it would no longer be promoting Kelly’s music, although his music would remain in their streaming catalog. In a statement, Spotify said that it had “updated our policy to include R. Kelly’s music in our inappropriate content policy.” The company added that it would “continue to monitor the situation and may remove more of his music if necessary.” 2018: R. Kelly is dropped by his record label RCA Records, a subsidiary of Sony Music, dropped Kelly from its roster after the #MeToo reckoning. In a statement, the label said that it “takes matters of sexual misconduct very seriously” and that it was “no longer working with R. Kelly.” 2018: R. Kelly’s touring schedule is disrupted After the #MeToo reckoning, Kelly’s touring schedule was disrupted as venues and festivals began to drop him from their lineups. In April 2018, he was set to perform at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, but he was removed from the lineup after the allegations against him surfaced."

Here’s how the Biebs is coping with his time apart from Sel.  Justin Bieber, 24, is going through a tough time as his relationship with Selena Gomez, 25, is on pause. She’s currently on vacation with friends in Sydney, Australia, where she appears to be carefree in this new video. However, a source reveals that the same can’t be said for Bieber. “Justin has Selena on the brain constantly. He is trying to drown it out by hanging with friends and doing stuff on his own time but he keeps thinking about her,” a source EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com. “He always wants to be around her, talk to her and be with her. She is like a drug for him, he just needs more and more and more.”  As the Biebs continues to struggle with their time apart, he’s got a few things up his sleeve for when she returns to LA. “He can’t wait until she is back because he wants to really wine and dine her upon her return and really kick start the relationship back up again,” the insider reveals. It’s unclear when Sel is scheduled to return to the West Coast. But, as seen on her Instagram, she is having the time of her life. She posted a video which showed her laughing on a boat, accompanied by a subliminal message, that she “chose” to take care of herself, “not to prove anything to anyone.” Was she trying to give us insight into her most recent split with Bieber?

In a surprising turn of events, Emma Stone has been spotted vacationing in the South of France with Justin Theroux. This comes after the actor split from Jennifer Aniston in February, and has since been linked to a number of other women, including Selena Gomez, Aubrey Plaza, and Petra Collins. However, the latest development in Theroux's love life has left many fans wondering if he may have found a new partner in Stone.
The two were recently photographed together at Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc in Saint-Paul-De-Vence, and later attended the Louis Vuitton Cruise 2019 show at The Maeght Foundation. Further fueling speculation, they were also seen with actress Laura Harrier, who is also a co-star of Theroux's in Netflix's upcoming series, Maniac.

Interestingly, Theroux was also seen spending time with Harrier, who is vacationing with Stone, at the same events. While it remains unclear whether he is actually dating both women, the photos do suggest a close friendship between the three.
As always, only time will tell if these rumors of Theroux's new romance are true. However, for now, fans can simply enjoy the intriguing speculation surrounding the actor's love life."

Madonna was hit with a series of “uncomfortable questions” by a judge before she was granted permission to adopt her 4-year-old twin girls from Malawi, the presiding judge said in court documents obtained by The Associated Press on Wednesday, February 8.  “The petitioner is a professional performer and I guarded myself against the danger of her merely reciting a well-rehearsed speech by asking her some rather uncomfortable questions to which she gave very candid answers,” Judge Fiona Mwale said in her ruling, explaining her reasons for approving the adoption.  After pressing Madonna, 58, to explain her intentions in adding two more little ones to her brood of four, Judge Mwale said she was satisfied that the girls would be in good hands with the Material Girl.  “There is no doubt that the petitioner can offer the infants not only the best education money can buy, but also guidance with a high likelihood of ensuring that the two infants grow to be self-sufficient adults,” Judge Mwale said, adding that she is satisfied that Madonna “is motivated by her desire to offer a home, love, protection and guidance to the infants.”  In the court documents, Judge Mwale addressed prior controversies surrounding Madonna’s adoptions in Malawi. “In determining her motives, I questioned the petitioner at length about the impact of her decision which could be construed as robbing Malawi of its most precious resource, its children,” the judge wrote.  As previously reported, Madonna filed for adoption in High Court in Malawi on January 25 but tried to keep the process under wraps until a final decision was made. (The Queen of Pop issued a statement denying her adoption to Us Weekly that same day, claiming that she was in Malawi “to check on the children’s hospital in Blantyre.”) According to the AP, she has already raised $7.5 million for a pediatric surgery ward at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, which is set to open early next year.  Madonna previously adopted son David and daughter Mercy James, both 11, from Malawi in 2008 and 2009, respectively. She is also mom to daughter Lourdes, 20, whom she shares with ex Carlos Leon, and son Rocco, 16, whom she shares with ex-husband Guy Ritchie.  Madonna’s twin girls will retain their birth names as a part of an effort to preserve their identity as Malawian nationals, the court documents said, and their father was at the January 25 court hearing with Madonna. (The twins’ mother died within a week of childbirth due to health complications.)  On Wednesday, February 8, Madonna took to social media to share the happy news. “I can officially confirm I have completed the process of adopting twin sisters from Malawi and am overjoyed that they are now part of our family,” she captioned an image of herself walking between the two little girls. “I am deeply grateful to all those in Malawi who helped make this possible, and I ask the media please to respect our privacy during this transitional time. 🙏🏻 Thank you also to my friends, family and my very large team for all your support and Love!”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!

Early life [ edit ]  Sofia Richie was born in Los Angeles, California to parents Lionel Richie and his second wife Diane Alexander. She is the younger sister of Nicole Richie (who was adopted) and the biological sister of Miles Richie.[1] Sofia Richie's godfather was Michael Jackson. She reported that the visits to Jackson's Neverland Ranch were some of her favorite memories as a child, and she became close friends with his daughter, Paris.[2]  Richie grew up with an affinity for music like her father. She learned to sing at age 5 and to play the piano at age 7.[3] She made occasional appearances at her father's shows[2] and took vocal lessons from Beyonce's vocal coach, Tim Carter, when she was 14, as well.[3] She also worked in the studio with her brother-in-law (and Good Charlotte lead vocalist) Joel Madden.[4][3] She decided to move away from a music career, however, because of the pressure of living up to her father's stature in the music industry.[5]  Richie spent some time at Oaks Christian School—nicknamed ""Celebrity High""—before being educated at home for several years while her father was on tour. She played soccer until age 16 when she broke her hip in a Segway accident.[5]  Modeling career [ edit ]  Richie began modeling at age 14 with a feature in Teen Vogue[4] and at 15 she got her first fashion contract with Los Angeles-based swimwear company Mary Grace Swim.[6] The next year, Richie signed with London-based modeling agency Select Model Management.[7]  Richie has featured in advertising campaigns for a number of brands including DL1961,[8] Madonna's Material Girl line,[2] Chanel,[9] Dolce & Gabbana,[9] Adidas, Michael Kors,[11] and Tommy Hilfiger.[9] She has done photoshoots for Elle and Vanity Fair[5] and has recently appeared on the cover of Complex[5] and Billboard magazine's style issue.[3]","Personally, I find this passage a bit lackluster in terms of style and tone. Here's how I would rewrite it to make it more convincing: Sofia Richie, the youngest daughter of the legendary singer-songwriter Lionel Richie and adoptive sister of fashion designer and television personality Nicole Richie, was born in Los Angeles, California on August 24, 1998. From a young age, Sofia showed a keen interest in the arts, particularly music, as she grew up surrounded by her father's melodious tunes. She began singing at the age of five and playing the piano at seven, and soon became a regular at her father's concerts. However, Sofia eventually decided to pursue a different path, choosing to focus on her modeling career instead of following in her father's footsteps. At the tender age of 14, Sofia made her modeling debut in Teen Vogue, and soon after signed with Los Angeles-based swimwear company Mary Grace Swim. A year later, she signed with London-based modeling agency Select Model Management, and her career took off. Sofia has since graced the covers of top fashion magazines such as Complex and Billboard, and has modeled for some of the biggest brands in the industry, including Chanel, Dolce & Gabbana, and Tommy Hilfiger. Despite her success, Sofia remains humble and grounded, crediting her parents and her experiences growing up with them for her values and work ethic."

Something as simple as a picture of Aniston with her hand on her stomach is proof enough for some tabloids that the actress is expecting a baby. Now, a new report claims that the Friends star has hired a surrogate, could there be any truth to the story?  In the new issue of Star, the tabloid features the headline, “Jen To Justin: I’ll Raise Our Baby Alone!” followed by a story that asserts Aniston wants to become a mom, and she will do it with or without her husband. The publication claims to have a source that reveals Aniston’s marriage is “on the rocks,” and she is planning to be a single mom.  ?…❤️✌️ A post shared by @justintheroux on Aug 5, 2017 at 4:23pm PDT  “Privately, she has told friends that she’s secretly gone ahead and hired a surrogate mother to carry her child to birth. And she’s vowed to raise the baby alone,” tells the insider.  But then the source says the actress is hoping to choose the right woman soon, completely contradicting the earlier quote, which is a huge red flag that something isn’t right with this claim.  But many think the tabloid story is completely false and contradictory quotes prove the story is garbage, questioning why the insider is sharing such private and secret information with a tabloid.  This is the same magazine that published a story earlier this year claiming Aniston herself was pregnant, but then didn’t mention that at all in its latest baby claims.  Aniston told Glamour magazine back in August that not only are the pregnancy tabloid stories guilty of body shaming, but they are also an invasion into a private matter between her and her husband. She said it is no one’s business whether or not she has a baby.  Jennifer Aniston went on to say that the subject of having a baby is a sensitive topic for her, and no one has the right to judge other people’s choices.

It is important to be aware of the potential for tabloids to sensationalize stories for the sake of selling magazines, and to always fact-check the information before believing it. Until there is more concrete evidence, it is best to just wait and see what happens. Jennifer Aniston is a talented actress who has been in the public eye for many years. She has been the subject of many rumors and speculation, including the constant rumors of her pregnancy. While the actress has never publicly confirmed or denied the rumors, it is clear that the tabloids will continue to"
gossipcop-5840642713,1,0,"Sky high prices are reportedly keeping fans from buying tickets to Taylor Swift’s upcoming Reputation tour, per a story by the New York Post. Though her 1989 world tour boasted numerous sold out performances (it eventually became the highest grossing tour of 2015), it appears her considerably more expensive snake persona is a tougher sell.  Last month, her “longtime” tour promoter told Billboard, “By the time all the tickets are sold next week, I’ll be celebrating Taylor’s birthday with a cocktail in my hand and sold-out concerts all over the world.” But her birthday has come and gone, and not one date has sold out.  Reputation was the biggest-selling album of 2017 and the tour is shaping up to be far from ill-attended, so the Post’s headline, “Taylor Swift’s Reputation tour shaping up to be a disaster,” is a little much. It does, however, highlight the problems with unpredictable pricing, scalpers, and Ticketmaster in general.  The company’s “Verified Fan” program, which they would like you to believe is all about rewarding music lovers, appears to be nothing but a cash grab that takes advantage of Swift-obsessed teens with easy access to their parents’ credit card numbers. People willing to drop $50 on merch, the Post reports, could “improve [their] position in line to purchase tickets.” And, once accessible, the tickets are often too expensive for many fans.  “I paid $150 for my ticket with amazing seats for the 1989 tour,” one fan wrote. “Now for the same seats I have to pay about $500.”  Advertisement  In related news, tickets to Katy Perry’s Friday show in New Orleans are currently starting at $23.","99.   Though it is unclear what kind of ""sold-out"" shows the Post is referencing, it is clear that the ticket prices for Swift's tour are causing some fans to reconsider their plans to attend.   As of now, the Reputation tour has not been officially announced, but it has been widely reported that Swift will kick off the tour on May 8th at New York's Gillette Stadium.  And while scalpers are undoubtedly circling the venue with their pricey tickets, the actual cost to fans is not insignificant.  According to the Post, the cheapest ticket available for Swift's show at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, will run you $250.  That's nearly three times the cost of a ticket to see Perry in New Orleans.  As the article notes, the prices are reportedly keeping fans from buying tickets.   This is particularly concerning for Swift, who has long been known for her dedication to her fans and her commitment to giving them a good show.  At the same time, it is worth noting that Swift's team has yet to comment on the issue.  As a journalist, it is important to consider the potential impact of these high prices on Swift's fans, as well as the broader issue of ticket prices in the music industry.  It is clear that the Reputation tour is shaping up to be a major event, but it remains to be seen how the high prices will affect fan attendance.  Will Swift's dedication to her fans be enough to overcome the financial hurdles?  Only time will tell."

gossipcop-6225895099,1,0,"Chris Soules, former star of ABC’s “The Bachelor,” after his arrest. (Buchanan County Sheriff via AP) Iowa farmer Chris Soules, a former star on ABC’s “The Bachelor” who charmed reality TV viewers with his small-town life, was arrested this week after police said he fled a crash that killed a fellow farmer. Soules, 35, was charged with leaving the scene of a fatal crash, a class D felony, and could face up to five years in prison if he is convicted. The case has garnered the attention of Soules’s “Bachelor” fans as well as residents of Arlington, Iowa, where he lives, who had come to appreciate the reality TV star’s work as an unofficial Iowa ambassador and farm industry advocate. “This story is going to spread like wildfire around here and probably all over because of who he is,” Mary Jo Brown, Arlington’s city clerk, told the Des Moines Register. “Sometimes fame isn’t your friend.” Soules, who also appeared in “Dancing with the Stars” and “Worst Chefs in America,” called 911 at 8:20 p.m. Monday evening to report that he had rear-ended a tractor on a rural road north of the tiny town of Aurora, about six miles away from his home. The tractor veered into a ditch after being struck by his 2008 Chevrolet Silverado, Soules said. The tractor driver — later identified as 66-year-old Kenneth Mosher, a Vietnam War veteran — was unconscious and not breathing, Soules told the 911 operator, according to audio obtained by local media. The man had a pulse, but there was blood around his mouth, Soules said. Soules identified himself on the call, which lasted nearly six minutes, and sounded frantic. Between heavy breathing, he answered the dispatcher’s questions and took instructions. Soules told the 911 operator he did not know how to perform CPR and could be heard asking unidentified people at the scene if they could perform the lifesaving measure. The call ended abruptly after the operator told Soules law enforcement and medical first responders were on the way. “Can I, can I call you back really quick?” Soules asked the dispatcher. “Yeah, you can call me back,” she says. “Thank you,” Soules responds. Soules left the crash site after emergency responders arrived, but before deputies with the Buchanan County Sheriff’s Office were on the scene, according to authorities. Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Scott Bright told the Des Moines Register that Soules fled the scene on foot and later got into a truck. In police audio obtained by local media, a deputy told a dispatcher that Soules “took off” in a red truck. Authorities are trying to identify who picked up Soules in the truck, Buchanan County Sheriff Bill Wolfgram told the Associated Press. That person could face charges, he said. Alcohol was found at the scene and investigators are trying to determine whose it was and whether it or speed were factors in the crash. Soules was arrested about five hours after the incident and booked into the Buchanan County Jail, the Associated Press reported. He posted a $10,000 bond Tuesday morning and was released on the condition that he surrender his passport and wear an electronic monitor. During his first appearance in court, the Buchanan County assistant attorney told the judge that Soules refused to cooperate with law enforcement after they located him at his home. He “would not come out,” the attorney said, until officials obtained a search warrant, which “took hours.” Chris Soules making his initial court appearance in Buchanan County @KWWL pic.twitter.com/72bvEg0wVR — Elizabeth Amanieh (@EAmaniehKWWL) April 25, 2017 Wolfgram told the Associated Press that investigators were “running into some roadblocks when it comes to getting information” but acknowledged Soules was acting within his constitutional rights. According to court documents, Soules had several run-ins with the law in his early 20s. In 2011, he was charged three times with underage alcohol possession and pleaded guilty and paid a fine for an open container violation, reported the Des Moines R","a beach. Soules’s arrest has sparked a wave of reaction on social media, with some fans defending him and others calling for justice. The incident has also reignited conversations about the dangers of drinking and driving, as well as the scrutiny reality TV personalities face when their private lives intersect with the law."

ET’s Katie Krause spoke with Brolin at the Hallmark Channel and Hallmark Movies & Mysteries winter Television Critics Association red carpet on Saturday, where he revealed that despite his decades-long romance, he still doesn't have all the answers.  “I don’t know, because nobody trains you,” he said of the secret to his and Streisand's marriage. “This is my third time -- third marriage. I picked difficult situations the first two times, but I think you learn with each one. I’m a person that believes that if I’m wrong, that’s when I learn, and when I’m right, I haven’t learned a thing.”  Noting that he takes his relationship “day to day,” Brolin revealed that he’s an advocate of marriage counseling.  “I do believe in counseling if anybody ever has a problem in their marriage. Bring in a referee, talk it over, and I swear to you, it will dispel by the end of the session, each time!” he said. “Sometimes in a tough marriage, it’s tough to talk, but if you do, it works!”  The 77-year-old actor has also learned to maintain his marriage with Streisand by not interrupting her during hectic times.  “When she’s busy, she’s really focused, and part of our good relationship is that I understand that,” he shared. “And if I come to her with something important and she says, ‘I don’t have time right now,’ she doesn’t have time, period. That’s the way the mind works. You gotta focus.”  As for how Streisand, 75, makes him feel special, Brolin said, “I’m always welcome when I get home. I always get notes, ‘Hurry home!’ When I get there, there’s always something kind of great waiting for me, some plan, and I try to reciprocate.”  RELATED CONTENT:  Barbra Streisand Calls Out Golden Globes for Not Awarding More Female Directors  ‘Girls Trip' Star Tiffany Haddish Says She Taught Barbra Streisand All About Cardi B  Josh Brolin on His Ripped Bod and How He Knew Wife Kathyrn Boyd Was the One (Exclusive)  Related Gallery",James Brolin and Barbra Streisand.

gossipcop-218256509,1,1,"Postby Guest » Sun Jun 14, 2009 3:22 pm  So things started going downhill after Jen was at the academy Awards show. And smiled at Pitt. Up till tpo that moment Crazy Jo-lie had kept Brad far from Jen. Make no mistake about it. Her frantic traveling all over the place was an attempt at keeping Pitt away from her and and any other person who might think they were a friend. She can't stand anyone but her having anything to do with Pitt . Including his own family. I knew it would backfire one day. Brad what took so long????? She suffers from an extreme mental illness. She doesn't have the kids in school for the same reason.  I do believe she thought it would last. Seeing how sexy and pretty she thinks she is. A man should and would do anything she tells them to.  I am under the impression her treatment of her surrogate Holly had a sort of wake up call to Pitt as to how utterly evil she is. You can bet she dismissed her like a piece of shite. A woman who carried twins for her. Started making Brad see her game of using and abusing.  And when Jen said her and Brad talk all the time on the phone you know that was news to little miss do as I say not as I do Angelina still talks to her ex's Jo-LIE.    Guess all the years of trying to force Brad to believe Jen was a shallow no good woman has a way of catching up to one. It took this long for Pitt to see just what had truly happened. Her spells have lost the power to confuse.In Touch said she has a terrible jealous streak and can't stand Brad even looking at a woman SHE DEEMS ATTRACTIVE IN ANY WAY. WE ALL KNOW HOW MUCH FUN THAT CAN BE.    The National Enquirer  Says Brad is so happy to have a separation from her.Brad's closest friends are woman and that drives Angelina nuts she hates sharing him  He was mad she took the salt role because she had promised him she would stay at home and be a mom.  I mean you can see her doing whatever she damn well wanted to. And he went along with it. But they have twin babies and my guess is she spends very little time bonding with them. What woman would not want to be able to stay with her new little babies. Not this woman. Sick behavior for sure. And the only thing keeping Brad from making it final is the kids.  Angie be careful what you wish for. Seems like 6 kids are going to be without a mom and dad in one place. Good luck with that",". Why does she need so many kids anyway. He should of left them all in Africa and been done with it.  Good luck to Brad and the kids. I hope they come out okay in the end.  I do not know why this is happening.  But I do know that poor little Pitt will have to deal with this evil woman for the rest of his life.  And I do hope she gets what she deserves.  The National Enquirer Says Brad is so happy to have a separation from her.  This is all I know about the matter.  More news as it comes in.  The news is reporting that Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt have been separated for a while now.  As a journalist, I have been following this story closely and have found some interesting details.   According to sources close to the couple, things started going downhill after Jolie attended the Academy Awards show and smiled at Pitt.  Up until that moment, Jolie had been keeping Pitt far away from her ex-partner, Jon Voight.  It seems that Jolie suffers from a mental illness that causes her to become jealous and controlling of those around her, especially when it comes to Pitt.  As a result, she has been making it difficult for him to see their children, even though he is their legal guardian.   It seems that Jolie's behavior has finally caught up with her, and Pitt has decided to take legal action to gain full custody of their six children.  This news comes as no surprise to those who have been following the couple's tumultuous relationship over the years.  As a journalist, it is my duty to report the facts as they are known, and it is clear that Jolie's actions have caused immense pain and suffering for both Pitt and their children.   I hope that this separation will lead to a more peaceful and healthy environment for everyone involved.  And I do hope that Jolie gets what she deserves.  It's important to note that this is a developing story, and more information will be reported as it becomes available."
gossipcop-8342414455,1,0,"Forget Wills and Kate's dusty old Norfolk. The lovebirds want to hang out with the groovy set in the Cotswolds - and the local estate agents' eyes are lighting up. There comes a time in every couple's relationship when the question of moving in together becomes impossible to ignore. And when those two lovebirds have been stepping out for 15 months — even though they live 3,500 miles apart; he in the UK, she in Canada — it's not so much a case of 'if' as of 'when' they will settle down. So it comes as no surprise that Prince Harry, 33, and his actress girlfriend Meghan Markle, 36, are said to be house-hunting. £7.25million - North Aston Manor, Oxfordshire: This eight bedroom property, overlooking the stunning Cherwell Valley, has seven reception rooms, a spa, swimming pool and 18.2 acres with equestrian facilities. It's nine miles from Soho Farmhouse and swanky shopping centre Bicester Village, should Meghan fancy snapping up some designer bargains Prince Harry and actress girlfriend Meghan Markle were pictured together at the Invictus Games in Toronto last month Royal sources have exclusively told the Daily Mail that the royal couple are looking in Oxfordshire and are particularly interested in high-end properties tucked away in the rolling Cotswold hills. A good friend of Harry's says the Prince, whose father's residence, Highgrove House, is in the south Cotswolds, has a long-standing affection for the area, while Meghan is said to be entranced by its rustic charm. 'He is searching for a new home in the area,' the friend reveals. 'Before Meghan, he was vaguely looking in Norfolk, but didn't find what he wanted. Now, with her input, he's renewed his search.' £2million - The Old Rectory, Lower Brailes, Oxfordshire: A stunning wood-panelled property dating from the 14th century, this boasts eight bedrooms, a sun-drenched terrace and its own private lake, complete with duck house. There’s a three-bedroom coach house for guests and it’s set at the end of a no-through road. Certainly, the lush green countryside encompassing swathes of Warwickshire, Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire is a huge draw for London-dwellers eager to snap up rural boltholes. Just an hour or so from the capital, it's home (or at least a weekend retreat) to A-listers, politicians and media executives: the Camerons, Beckhams, Kate Moss, Lily Allen and Stella McCartney all have million-pound properties in the area. 'It's like a magnet,' says Sophie Gannon, of Savills Estate Agents in Banbury, Oxfordshire. 'If you get one person, you get them all.' However, Harry isn't following the crowd but listening to his heart. The Cotswolds, and specifically Highgrove, which was bought by his father's private estate in 1980, is where the Prince spent much of his childhood. It was Charles and Diana's weekend home, with 15-acre grounds and, later on, a teenage haven in the cellars of the main house, which Harry nicknamed 'Club H'. £2.95million - Fanthill, Banbury, Oxfordshire: Accessed through electric gates, up a winding driveway, this eight-bedroom house sits among 20 acres of land, so ticks all Harry’s boxes when it comes to privacy. There’s a heated outdoor pool, miniature golf course and a carp lake, where the young lovebirds could row off the private pier A local who knows the family says: 'It's not surprising that Harry would like to live where he feels at home. 'He's lived in the Cotswolds all his life and often returns to visit his father. After his mother died, it became a place of sanctuary. 'When the boys entered their teens, Charles bought several homes in the area, thinking they might want one in the future.' Ten years ago, Charles bought up properties adjacent to his sprawling estate, paying £2 million apiece for nearby manor houses and farm buildings. But sources say rather than living off his father's generosity, Harry wants to invest in a place of his own. £4.25million - Cross Hill House, Adderbury, Oxfordshire: This 10-bedroom house, surrounded by landscaped","the hectic pace of London. And, as the Mail on Sunday's royal correspondent pointed out last weekend, the Cotswolds are a 'perfect compromise between the hustle and bustle of city life and the privacy of the countryside'. It's a place where they can build their dream home, put down roots and start a family, with plenty of space for the occasional visit from the Queen, Prince Philip and other members of the family."
gossipcop-2365987922,1,0,"Jenny and her silk pillowcases.  It’s no secret that Jennifer Lopez-at 48-has a body that won’t quit and skin that needs to be studied so we can all age like the goddess she is.  Dramatic? Not even close.  And while a lot of it may be down to great genes, Lopez has revealed in a new interview some of her beauty secrets and yep, they’re as diva as you might expect.  Lopez credits her glow to positive affirmations, revealing she says one in particular to herself every day to keep her radiant, youthful look intact.  So what is this magic phrase?  “I am youthful and timeless at every age,” Lopez says every single day—but it’s not enough to just say the mantra daily, because Lopez also has a handful of pillows with these words and more mantras embroidered into them all over her home. “I tell myself that every day, a few times a day. It sounds like clichéd bullshit, but it’s not: Age is all in your mind. Look at Jane Fonda.”  Lopez continues, “The affirmations are everywhere. I forget that they’re all here. They’re just part of the house now.”  Before you scoff at Lopez’s positivity there is a school of thought that believes negative thoughts can age you. Australian-born Dr Blackburn, a Nobel Prize winner, co-authored The Telomere Effect: A Revolutionary Approach to Living Younger, Healthier, Longer, with anti-aging psychologist Dr Elissa Epel, which investigated the link between telomeres, which protect our chromosomes, and the effect stress, sleep and diet can have on telomeres and how that directly corresponds with our health.  The book asserts there is a correlation between depression and anxiety and shorter telomeres and that “when pessimists develop an aging-related illness, like cancer or heart disease, the illness tends to progress faster.”  And really there's only so far a little highlight can go, step one is all about a positive attitude. Step two is to find yourself a great pillowcase and settle on your new mantra.  So what’s the lesson here? Your inner glow is only a glass half full attitude away.","Rewritten passage:
Jennifer Lopez, at the age of 48, possesses a physique that defies the laws of time and gravity. Her skin, a testament to her dedication to self-care and wellness, continues to captivate and inspire. In a recent interview, Lopez revealed some of the beauty secrets that have contributed to her timeless appearance. One of these secrets is the power of positive affirmations. Lopez recites a daily mantra to herself, which includes the phrase ""I am youthful and timeless at every age."" This simple yet powerful phrase serves as a reminder that age is merely a state of mind. Lopez's affirmations are not limited to a single mantra, as she has embroidered similar phrases onto multiple pillowcases scattered throughout her home. According to Lopez, these affirmations are an integral part of her daily routine and help maintain her youthful appearance.
In addition to her positive affirmations, Lopez also credits her glow to a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet and regular exercise. However, Lopez's commitment to self-care goes beyond physical appearance. She believes that a positive attitude and a glass half full outlook on life are essential for maintaining a youthful and radiant appearance. This philosophy is supported by Australian-born Dr. Blackburn, a Nobel Prize winner, who co-authored The Telomere Effect: A Revolutionary Approach to Living Younger, Healthier, Longer, with anti-aging psychologist Dr. Elissa Epel. This book explores the link between telomeres, which protect our chromosomes, and the effect of stress, sleep, and diet on telomere length. The authors argue that a positive attitude and a healthy lifestyle can help maintain longer telomeres, which are associated with better health and longevity.
In conclusion, Jennifer Lopez's commitment to positive affirmations and a healthy lifestyle is a testament to the power of a positive attitude in maintaining a youthful and radiant appearance. By embracing a glass half full outlook on life and incorporating positive affirmations into her daily routine, Lopez has managed to defy the aging process and continue to captivate and inspire. Whether through her music, her acting, or her beauty routine, Lopez serves as a shining example of the transformative power of a positive mindset."
gossipcop-4678149709,1,1,"Since separating from Channing Tatum in April, Jenna Dewan has put a cheery spin on the end of their nine-year marriage. “I feel I’ve been on a wave of growth,” Jenna said recently. “It’s OK for a relationship to change into a new form that is actually better for both people involved, and I think that’s maybe what shocked everyone so much — that it can be a positive thing.”  But it's apparently not so positive anymore. Each time Channing and Jenna head to mediation to discuss the terms of their divorce, “they can’t seem to agree on anything,” says a source. “Their meetings have been contentious.” One big issue: their five-year-old daughter, Everly. “They can’t agree on custody,” a friend tells In Touch exclusively.      Unicorns do exist. A post shared by Channing Tatum (@channingtatum) on May 4, 2018 at 6:40pm PDT      “They’re both working hard to do what’s in the best interest of their daughter, but it’s just taking way longer than they both expected because they can’t agree on the small details.” Another sticking point: Channing’s estimated $60 million fortune. Though Jenna, 37, has had a successful movie and TV career with shows like Supergirl, Channing, 38, has starred in several blockbusters, such as Magic Mike and 21 Jump Street, and was the family’s main breadwinner. “Jenna has told friends that she gave Channing the best years of her life,” says the source, “and now she’s trying to negotiate a very secure future for herself.”  There is a lot at stake financially. During the course of their marriage, the pair acquired several assets, including a $6 million Beverly Hills home and pricey cars including a Tesla and a vintage Chevrolet truck. Finding common ground about dividing their stuff “is not easy,” says the friend. “They both want it to be over with.”          Jenna never thought it would come to this. “She isn’t pleased about how it’s all played out so far,” says the source. “She’s bitter. There are days when she’s blaming him for not working harder to save their marriage.” And while she’s told pals that she hopes they can stay friends, adds the source, deep down “she knows that’s never going to happen.”  Channing shouldn’t underestimate Jenna, says the source: “She’s looking out for herself, and at the end of the day she knows that he’s got to pay. She’s not going to walk away quietly.”  For more on this, pick up the latest issue of In Touch — and for more exclusive content sign up for our newsletter.

Here is a rewritten passage of the given passage that is more convincing and engaging:  Since separating from Channing Tatum in April, Jenna Dewan has put on a brave face and chosen to focus on the positive aspects of her newfound freedom. ""I feel like I've been on a wave of growth,"" she recently stated, indicating that she is embracing this new chapter in her life with optimism.  But despite her efforts to remain upbeat, the reality of the situation is much more complicated. According to sources close to the couple, their divorce negotiations have been contentious, with the pair unable to agree on even the smallest details. The main sticking point? Their five-year-old daughter, Everly, and the custody arrangements that will affect her life moving forward.  While both Jenna and Channing are reportedly working hard to do what is in the best interest of their daughter, the process has proven to be much more challenging than they anticipated. ""They can't agree on the small details,"" a friend told In Touch exclusively, highlighting the complexity of the situation.  Another major issue is Channing's estimated $60 million fortune, which has created tension in the negotiations. As the main breadwinner during their marriage, Jenna has understandably been concerned about securing her financial future. ""She has given Channing the best years of her life,"" a source close to the couple revealed, ""and now she's trying to negotiate a very secure future for herself.""  The stakes are high, both financially and emotionally, and it's clear that neither party is willing to compromise easily. Finding common ground about dividing their assets, including their $6 million Beverly Hills home and their prized possessions, is proving to be a difficult task.  Despite the challenges they face, Jenna remains determined to protect her interests and ensure that her daughter's needs are met. ""She's looking out for herself and at the end of the day, she knows that he's got to pay,"" a source close to the couple revealed, indicating that Jenna is not willing to back down without a fight.  As the divorce process continues, it's clear that this is just the beginning of a long and difficult road ahead.

gossipcop-1550362715,1,0,"In the immortal words of Hilary Duff, “Let’s go back, back to the beginning.” January 2016 played host to a series of Kardashian-Jenner-West-Rose-Chyna feuds that have been years in the making. From “cool pants” to clover emojis, there’s a lot of backstory that needs explaining in order to completely understand everything that went down among Kanye West and Wiz Khalifa and Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna. To keep you informed, Us Weekly has broken it down with a comprehensive timeline of events. Kanye West Dates Amber Rose In 2008, the Grammy-winning rapper started a relationship with unknown model Rose after spotting her in Ludacris’ “What Them Girls Like” music video. The pair had a public two-year romance. Amber Rose Breaks Up With Kanye West In mid-2010, Rose called things off with West. A year after the split, Rose appeared on The Wendy Williams Show, noting, “[Kanye] said that he was an a-hole and he was mean to me and he didn’t treat me the way he was supposed to. I accepted his apology because I feel like he’s remorseful for how he treated me.” Blac Chyna and Tyga Have a Son, Get Engaged Meanwhile, an up-and-coming rapper named Tyga welcomed a baby boy named King Cairo Stevenson with his then-girlfriend, model Blac Chyna, in October 2012. “Most amazing feeling ever. #Blessed #2Kings,” Tyga captioned a Twitter photo cradling his little boy. That December, the couple confirmed they were engaged in an Instagram post featuring Chyna’s giant diamond ring. Kanye West Starts Dating Kim Kardashian Fresh off his split from Rose, West set his sights on his longtime friend and crush Kim Kardashian in early 2012. The pair were spotted out together and Kardashian’s famous family even started pressing the reality star for details on her new romance (remember when he let her borrow his car?!). Kanye West Raps About Wiz Khalifa, Amber Rose As West’s romance with Kardashian blossomed, so did that of his ex Rose and her new rapper fiancé, Wiz Khalifa. In April 2012, West released the song “Cold” in which he rapped, “Only n—a I got respect for is Wiz / And I’ll admit, I had fell in love with Kim around the same time she had fell in love with him.” Amber Rose Marries Wiz Khalifa After Welcoming Son Sebastian In February 2013, Rose and Khalifa had their first child, son Sebastian, announcing the news on Twitter. In July 2013, the couple secretly wed; the next month, they had a big ceremony in which Rose wore a stunning Pnina Tornai for Kleinfeld gown. She didn’t share photos from the private event until their one-year anniversary. North West Is Born Following a difficult pregnancy, Kim gave birth to her daughter, North West, in June 2013. West penned the song “Only One” for his little girl.

As new mom Kim worked hard to get back to her pre-baby weight in time for her wedding to West, she posted selfies in workout clothes with Chyna by her side. Kanye West Marries Kim Kardashian After gracing the cover of Vogue in wedding couture, the A-list couple tied the knot in an elaborate European wedding weekend that began in Paris and ended with an Italian ceremony in May 2014. Rob Kardashian Skips the Wedding, Remains Under the Radar Things got awkward when Kim’s younger brother, Rob Kardashian, left Kim’s wedding festivities early. His exit followed months of erratic behavior: avoiding appearances on the family’s reality series, Keeping Up With the Kardashians, significant weight gain and depression. He’s stayed out of the public eye ever since. “He sent me a long email the morning of [saying] that he was going to leave,” Kim later said on Watch What Happens Live. “There was no fight.” Blac Chyna and Tyga Split In August 2014, the parents called it quits. “They are trying to keep it amicable,” ","17,” she tweeted. “I have a job, I have a business, I have a TV show, I have a clothing line, I have a multitude of things going on. Please don’t compare me to a stripper. I’m not a stripper, I’m a businesswoman.” Amber Rose Says Kylie Jenner and Tyga Are ""Fake"" In a December 2015 interview with Power 105.1’s The Breakfast Club, Rose doubled down on her criticism of Jenner and Tyga, calling their relationship “fake” and noting that she’s “not the only one who thinks it’s fake.” “I think it’s interesting how [Tyga] went from dating a 31-year-old mother of one to a 17-year-old who just turned 18,” Rose said. “I think it’s really interesting how people go from one to the other. And I think it’s really fake.” Kanye West Releases ""Facts"" Amid Kim Kardashian Feud In November 2016, West dropped the song “Facts,” which many interpreted as a response to his estranged wife’s recent Paris robbery. In the song, West raps about his frustration with the media for portraying Kim as a damsel in distress. “She’s a queen, not a victim,” he raps. “And I’m the one who’s supposed to protect her?” The line sparked speculation that West was taking shots at Jenner, who had been romantically linked to him in the past. Kanye West Says He's ""Tried to Call"" Kim Kardashian Amid Feud In an interview with TMZ in December 2016, West revealed that he had been trying to reach out to his estranged wife amid their feud. “I’ve tried to call her,” he said. “I’ve been trying to call her. I haven’t heard from her. I don’t know if she’s upset with me or whatever the case may be.”"

gossipcop-9639077061,1,0,"Ivanka Trump is becoming one of the most powerful first children in American History – despite not having an official job in the Trump administration. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) Ivanka Trump’s products weren’t always the hottest items online. In January, for instance, the first daughter’s fashion line ranked No. 550 based on the number of orders from Lyst, the biggest fashion e-commerce website in the world, according to Forbes. That changed dramatically the following month. Sales of Trump’s products skyrocketed in early February, making her Lyst’s 11th most popular brand. The biggest spike, according to Lyst, came on Feb. 9, when sales jumped by 219 percent from the day before. Yes, Feb. 9 — the same day that White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted Trump’s clothing and jewelry line on “Fox & Friends.” “Go buy Ivanka’s stuff is what I would tell you,” Conway said. “I’m going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody.” And viewers did, apparently. Sales of Ivanka Trump’s branded products skyrocketed on Feb. 9, the same day White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted the line on Fox News. (Lyst) Abigail Klem, president of the Ivanka Trump brand, said in a statement that “the beginning of February” shows “the best performing weeks in the history of the brand.” “For several different retailers, Ivanka Trump was a top performer online, and in some of the categories it was the best performance ever,” Klem said. Sarah Tanner, Lyst’s spokeswoman, said increases in sales are usually tied to current events. For instance, interest in pantsuits went up by 460 percent last year because of Hillary Clinton’s affinity for the style, she said. Sales of the first daughter’s products went up by 86 percent in November when her father won the presidential election, according to the company. Conway has come under fire for touting Ivanka Trump's clothing line during a televised interview. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) [A Trump wine boycott backfires spectacularly] But the brand was “largely featured” in the news in February, Tanner said. Conway gave her on-air endorsement of Ivanka Trump’s brand after President Trump had complained on Twitter that his daughter had “been treated so unfairly” by the department store Nordstrom, which dropped her clothing line over slow sales. “It would not be a surprise to us if it resulted in the increase in sales,” Tanner said of Conway’s Fox interview. “I think that’s one of the reasons the brand was largely in the news and could have attributed to this increase.” Conway did not respond to an email requesting comment. Her promotion of the fashion line appeared to violate an ethics rule barring federal employees from using their public office to endorse products and immediately drew criticism from both Democrats and Republicans. [Where does the Ivanka Trump brand go from here?] Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said Conway’s comments were “absolutely wrong, wrong, wrong” and “clearly over the line,” The Washington Post reported. The White House later said that Conway had been “counseled.” But concerns about her comments remain. On Thursday, the government’s top ethics official criticized the White House for not disciplining Conway, The Post’s Drew Harwell reported. Walter M. Shaub Jr., director of the Office of Government Ethics, had urged officials last month to reprimand the White House counsel but was rebuffed. On Thursday he wrote to Stefan C.

A source told US magazine OK!: “When they got back together, Liam thought things would be different, but Miley hasn’t changed at all.  “She’s sobered up but she’s still immature and isn’t ready to commit to spending the rest of her life with one person.  “They do love each other but at this point it’s starting to become clear this relationship simply can’t go the distance.”  Miley and Liam are have tried couple’s therapy according to the magazine, but it hasn’t worked and only led to more fights. Liam is also said by friends to be envious of his brother, Chris, having three kids with his wife Elsa Pataky, but while he’s feeling more and more broody, Miley is not ready to commit to children and wants to focus on her career and having fun.","In addition, OK! also reports that Miley has also been spotted with a new guy, who looks like a potential new love interest.   A source close to the couple tells OK!: “Miley is having a blast with this new guy and Liam is feeling more and more like he’s been left behind.  “He’s realized that he can’t compete with her party lifestyle and her desire to have fun and be free.  “Liam is trying to be understanding and supportive, but he’s also feeling really hurt and confused about where things went wrong and how he can get them back on track.  “It’s a tough situation for both of them, but especially for Liam, who really wants to make this work.”   The couple first met on the set of the movie “The Last Song” in 2010, and got engaged in 2012. They split in 2013 but got back together in 2016.   The passage is written in a sensationalized and speculative manner, with the author relying on unnamed sources and vague statements to make their claims. The tone is negative and critical, with the author seemingly taking pleasure in the couple's supposed troubles. However, the passage could be rewritten to be more balanced and informative, while still maintaining a serious and calm tone. Here is an example of how the passage could be rewritten:  According to sources close to the couple, Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth may be facing another rough patch in their relationship. The couple, who first met on the set of the movie ""The Last Song"" in 2010 and got engaged in 2012, have reportedly been experiencing tension and disagreements in recent months.  A source told OK! magazine that after a period of reconciliation, Miley and Liam are now ""starting to realize that their differences are too great to overcome."" The source added that while the couple still has feelings for each other, they are struggling to find common ground and are considering ending their engagement for a second time.  The report suggests that Liam has been feeling increasingly frustrated with Miley's partying lifestyle and her desire to focus on her career and personal freedom, rather than committing to a long-term relationship. The source close to the couple also revealed that Miley has been spending time with a new man, which has added to the tension in their relationship.  Despite the challenges they are facing, both Miley and Liam are said to be ""very hurt"" and ""confused"" about the situation, and are reportedly trying to find a way to work through their issues. The couple first split in 2013, but reconciled in 2016.  By rewriting the passage in this way, the author is able to provide a more balanced and informative account of the situation, while still maintaining a serious and calm tone. The use of unnamed sources is still present, but the author takes pains to provide a more nuanced and balanced view of the situation, rather than relying solely on sensationalized claims and speculation."

Johansson, who filed for divorce from French journalist Romain Dauriac in March, has been seeing “Saturday Night Live: Weekend Update” star Colin Jost since May, which was exclusively revealed by Page Six.  The cute couple was together on Sept. 30, when Johansson was spotted dropping Jost off at a star-studded “SNL” after-party at Tao Uptown that included guests like Beyoncé, Jay-Z, Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone and Dakota Johnson.  This article originally appeared in the New York Post.","Here's the rewritten passage:
Scarlett Johansson and Food Network star Bobby Flay were spotted enjoying a friendly dinner together over the weekend, leading to speculation about a possible romance. However, a representative for the actress has confirmed that there is no romantic involvement between the two. ""ScarJo and Bobby are simply friends and neighbors in the Hamptons,"" the rep stated.
Flay, who was previously linked to actress Heléne Yorke, has been through a public split with his wife of 10 years, Stephanie March, in 2015. Johansson, who filed for divorce from French journalist Romain Dauriac in March, has been dating ""Saturday Night Live: Weekend Update"" star Colin Jost since May, a relationship that was exclusively revealed by Page Six.

gossipcop-2194660040,1,1,"First Lady Melania Trump claims there is a secret poisoner in the White House and fears her husband is being slowly poisoned with “heavy sedatives” smuggled into his drinks in an attempt to slow him down, control him, and discredit his presidency, according to reports.  While public debate rages about Donald Trump’s health, Melania has told friends and associates that the once robust and high energy man she knew and loved has been replaced with a “slower, damaged version”.  “By 8pm he is slurring,” she said. “This is not the man I know.”  Fearing that the sedatives are being pumped into the body of the POTUS via Coca-Cola that he orders by pressing a button he had installed on the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, Melania has insisted he stop drinking from the tap and instead revert to drinking from cans she brings herself.  “Donald’s heath improved out of sight when he stopped drinking from the tap,” Melania said.  However the First Lady fears the active campaign to poison the president is “a high level operation” and “not the work of a solitary loon.”  Melania is popular in the White House—as she is with the rest of the country—and she has befriended senior intelligence agency staff who remain loyal to president. They have educated her about Ronald Regan’s poisoning by the Deep State after his assassination attempt in 1981. They have also warned her that George W. Bush was reduced to a “brain damaged” state after years of steady poisoning.  But the advantage Trump may hold over his GOP predecessors in the Oval Office is that he has a wife who is wise to the ruse and is insisting he watch his food and drink intake closely for signs of adulteration.  Donald Trump’s food choices say a lot about the man. The president’s Howard Hughes-level pickiness when it comes to food is partly motivated by a desire to avoid being poisoned, according to Melania. He doesn’t trust those around him – and rightfully so.  As President Trump knows all too well, there are enemies of the state dug in deep at the White House.  Reporters from TIME recently got a glimpse behind-the-scenes at the White House, where they reported on what goes down at the president’s dinner table. Of particular interest was a meal enjoyed by the reporters, Trump, and Vice President Pence.  Pence’s meal was not unusual—he ate what everyone else did. But the POTUS received a meal fully customized to his own preferences, and closely observed by Melania who insisted on watching the chef prepare the meal with ingredients she provided herself.","“Donald’s health is my top priority,” she said.  But the First Lady’s insistence on keeping a close eye on the president’s food intake is more than just a precaution.  It’s a sign that she is deeply concerned about the potential for assassination by poison.  “There are those who want him gone,” she said. “And they will stop at nothing to achieve their goal.”  Melania is convinced that the active campaign to poison the president is not just a one-off incident.  Rather, it is part of a larger, coordinated effort to take down the president and undermine his presidency.  She believes that the Deep State is engaged in an ongoing operation to disable and discredit the president.  “This is not just about one man,” she said. “It’s about an entire political system that has failed the American people.”  But despite the risks, Melania remains steadfast in her support for the president.  She is determined to do everything in her power to help him succeed and to protect him from those who would seek to harm him.  “I will not let them get away with this,” she said.  “I will fight to the end to defend my husband and this presidency.”  Melania’s words are a testament to her strength and resolve.  She is not just the First Lady of the United States.  She is a warrior, fighting to protect her husband and the American people from the forces of darkness that seek to undermine them.  As she continues to watch over the president, Melania remains a shining beacon of hope in these troubled times.  Her unwavering commitment to her husband and her country is an inspiration to us all."
gossipcop-9067064195,1,0,"Tom Cruise has seemingly been all about his movie career since his high-profile marriage to Katie Holmes met its demise. The action star has steadily starred in film after film, yet has been at the center of several dating rumors.  As the International Business Times reports, “The actor was mistakenly linked to an Australian journalist and then was associated to his Mission: Impossible 6 co-star and Crown actress Vanessa Kirby.”  All rumors until now have been stamped out as false.  However, the latest claims include those stating that members of the Church of Scientology have once again been playing matchmaker for the Top Gun star and that Cruise has reportedly been secretly dating over the past little while. Interestingly enough, Tom has reportedly been using a disguise to enjoy dates with the ladies, much like Katie Holmes did in the initial stages of her romance with Jamie Foxx.  A source told the publication about Cruise’s tactics to keep his love life out of the spotlight.  “Tom’s back on the dating scene, but nobody knows it’s him. His face is way too recognizable for him to stroll into the bars, so he has his makeup artist create a silicone mask. Seems like Tom took his Mission: Impossible role to heart. It’s just what Ethan Hunt would do in the movies.”  It’s also been claimed that the disguise, which includes makeup, takes a full five hours to apply. If this rumor all sounds a little far-fetched, that’s because it is completely untrue, according to Gossip Cop. Tom Cruise does not go through some elaborate process to secretly step out on dates. In fact, there has not been any confirmation that Tom Cruise has dated anyone since Katie Holmes.  Alberto E. Rodriguez / Getty Images  Katie Holmes, however, continues to attempt to keep her romance with Jamie Foxx a secret, despite the fact that the pair has been spotted on numerous occasions over the past year on beach getaways and romantic locales like Paris. Most recently the mysterious duo were spotted celebrating Jamie’s 50th birthday at a Santa Monica beach hotel last week, as Page Six relays.  Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx were spotted on another romantic beach getaway https://t.co/ZwdutxFdYe pic.twitter.com/dhoszJ2wg3 — Travel + Leisure (@TravelLeisure) December 19, 2017  Onlookers at the hotel stated that the duo appeared to be quite awkward while Katie kept looking around cautiously. The couple was also seen walking along the beach while Foxx had his arm around the beauty. This report is similar to the one earlier this year that stated Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx were spotted strolling along the beach hand-in-hand in Malibu.","There have been numerous sightings of the couple together since their summer vacation in St. Barts in 2013, despite their best efforts to keep their romance private. The two are said to have started dating in 2012, after meeting on the set of the movie “Law and Order: Special Victims Unit.”  The pair reportedly met on the set of Law & Order: SVU https://t.co/ZwdutxFdYe pic.twitter.com/y2EZw8Jv4L — Page Six (@PageSix) December 19, 2017  As the International Business Times reports, Katie Holmes has seemingly tried to keep her relationship with Jamie Foxx under wraps as much as possible, even going so far as to allegedly use her daughter Suri Cruise as an alibi for whereabouts during the time she and Foxx were spotted on a beach vacation in 2013.  Despite the numerous sightings of Katie and Jamie together, neither of them has publicly confirmed their romance."

gossipcop-2161541420,1,0,"Kate Hudson Net Worth: Kate Hudson is an American actress who has a net worth of $38 million dollars. Born Kate Garry Hudson on April 19, 1979, in Los Angeles, California, US, she came to prominence in 2001 with her incredible turn in Almost Famous. This role not only made her famous, but it also fetched her a Golden Globe and several nominations, including a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Being a daughter of American actress Goldie Hawn, Hudson bears more than a passing resemblance to her famous mother in both looks and onscreen vivacity. She got the chance to showcase her talent in 1996, when she made her TV debut on Fox's TV series Party of Five (1994-2000). Although she only appeared in one episode titled ""Spring Breaks: Part 1"", this initial experience was enough to uphold her determination to develop a professional acting career in Hollywood. However, it was in 1999 that she started to attract public attention when critics lauded her brilliant portrayal of Cindy in ""200 Cigarettes"", even though the movie itself was a commercial disappointment. Onwards, her career experienced a significant advancement, especially after she managed to obtain a supporting role in ""Gossip"" and ""Dr T and the Women"" which both came up in 2000. While her accolade-worthy performance in Cameron Crowe's Almost Famous indicated that she was set to follow her mother in taking the film industry by storm. In the midst of a whirlwind schedule of fashion shoots and awards shows, she made an appearance in the romantic war drama The Four Feathers in 2002. Turning out to be a box-office failure, Hudson fired back with the surefire hit as she starred opposite quirky heartthrob Matthew McConaughey in the romantic comedy How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003). She continued to establish herself as a fully-fledged actress starring in subsequent productions like Raising Helen (2004), The Skeleton Key (2005), You, Me and Dupree (2006), Fool's Gold (2008) and Bride Wars (2009). As of most recent, she could be seen in the musical comedy-drama television series Glee as Cassandra July.","The actress is married to actor Chris Robinson, and the couple has two sons together, Ryder Russell Robinson, and Bingham Hawn Robinson. Even though her personal life has been a subject of interest for many, Hudson has managed to maintain a high level of professionalism in her acting career, an accomplishment not many of her contemporaries can boast of.

gossipcop-6048462622,1,1,"Some reports suggest Ben Affleck and girlfriend Lindsay Shookus' relationship may have been going on even while they were still married to their respective spouses. A source tells ET that Affleck first saw Shookus while he was still married to Jennifer Garner, and Shookus was married to Kevin Miller -- a fellow Saturday Night Live producer. According to the source, Affleck and Shookus were seeing one another as far back as late 2014, months before news broke that he had an alleged fling with his children's nanny, Christine Ouzounian. Affleck's reported dalliance with the nanny happened in the summer of 2015, and was short-lived, our source says. However, a source close to 44-year-old Affleck disputes that the actor and Shookus got together while both were married, although the two were friendly. The source says the two got romantic after his separation from Garner in 2015.

Affleck last appeared on SNL in May 2013. Interestingly enough, Garner made an appearance during Affleck's monologue at the time, to celebrate the actor hosting the show for the fifth time. The two joked about Affleck's Best Picture acceptance speech for Argo at the Oscars, in which he said that his and Garner's marriage took ""work."" Affleck publicly thanked Garner for all her support onstage, and the two sweetly shared a kiss. One month later, eyewitnesses reportedly spotted Affleck and Shookus looking flirty at The Heat premiere after-party in NYC. ""He definitely looked interested in her,"" a partygoer told People at the time. The two later left together with other friends and headed to the nearby Mandarin Oriental hotel bar.

Affleck and Shookus ""full-on had an affair,"" claims a source cited by People. ""They would fly back and forth, but he would mostly visit her in New York. They didn't hide."" ""Both of them were married at the time. They were having secret rendezvous every time he came in to New York City and other places, too,"" claims a second source the magazine quotes.

A new report from OK! is claiming that things might start heating up between Robert Pattinson, 32, and Sienna Miller, 36. The two actors “have been close for years,” an insider tells the magazine, adding that “they’ve always had a great connection, but one of them was always with someone else, so it stayed platonic.” However, both of them aren’t currently seeing anyone now. “Now that they’re both single, the door is open for them to give this a real shot,” the source continued.  As for the pair’s friends, they reportedly think that these two would work really well together. “All of their mutual friends think Rob and Sienna would be a good match,” the insider said. Rob and Sienna have always seemed pretty close. While promoting their film, The Lost City Of Z at the Berlin International Film Festival in Feb. 2017, the pair looked comfortable together while posing for photos and grabbing dinner together.

gossipcop-7885025406,1,0,"More than a month has passed since Matt Lauer was fired from the Today show, and his former longtime colleague, Katie Couric, is now opening up about the former NBC anchor’s shocking dismissal.  “The whole thing has been very painful for me,” Couric, 61, tells PEOPLE. “The accounts I’ve read and heard have been disturbing, distressing and disorienting and it’s completely unacceptable that any woman at the Today show experienced this kind of treatment.  “I had no idea this was going on during my tenure or after I left,” she continued. “I think I speak for many of my former colleagues when I say this was not the Matt we knew. Matt was a kind and generous colleague who treated me with respect. In fact, a joke I once made on late-night television was just that, because it was completely contrary to our brother-sister relationship. It’s still very upsetting. I really admire the way Savannah [Guthrie] and Hoda [Kotb] and the entire Today show staff have handled a very difficult situation.”  The late-night show joke that Couric refers to is when she said on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen in 2012 that Lauer “pinches me on the ass a lot.” A clip of the comment made the rounds online in the wake of Lauer’s firing.  Couric spent 15 years co-hosting NBC’s Today show with Lauer, 60, but left in May 2006 to anchor the CBS Evening News.  NBC/Getty  Lauer was fired at the end of November by NBC News after the network received a “detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior,” with reason to believe “this may not have been an isolated incident.” Women have also anonymously accused him of sexual harassment and assault in reports published by Variety and The New York Times.  Following his firing, which was announced live on Today by Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb, Lauer addressed the original allegations in a statement.  “There are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions,” he said, in part. “To the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry. As I am writing this, I realize the depth of the damage and disappointment I have left behind at home and at NBC.”  Although her PEOPLE interview is the first time Couric has spoken in detail about Lauer’s exit, she briefly broke her silence about the scandal on social media in December.  In a short response to an Instagram user, who called Couric out for not publicly addressing the scandal, the veteran journalist said, “It’s incredibly upsetting and I will say something when I’m ready to. Thanks for your interest.”  RELATED VIDEO: Women of Hollywood Attend Golden Globes Together in Support of the Time’s Up Movement  The claims against Lauer came as hundreds of women and men — including Rose McGowan, Ashley Judd, Terry Crews and Anthony Rapp — have publicly came forward about alleged sexual misconduct at the hands of powerful men in Hollywood, including Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey.  The movement inspired the new Time’s Up initiative and legal defense fund that was created to help victims of sexual misconduct pursue legal action against their perpetrators. Time’s Up was a major focus at this year’s Golden Globes, where almost all the famous attendees wore black to raise awareness about the cause.  “I think it was really moving to see so many women support each other and demand change, not only for themselves, but for mistreated and marginalized women in all kinds of industries,” Couric tells PEOPLE about Time’s Up. “Clearly we are witnessing a sea change and a long overdue course correction.”  She also said that one of the new of the episodes of her upcoming six-part documentary Nat Geo series will focus on harassment women have experienced in their workplaces.  “One of my Nat Geo episodes explores the various obstacles that are holding women back in Hollywood, Silicon Valley and beyond,” she says. “I just interviewed Elisabeth Moss about this.

After rewriting the passage, here is the rewritten one:
Gwen Stefani has dismissed rumors that she was ""dumped"" by Blake Shelton. The No Doubt singer took to Instagram to share a heartwarming photo of her country singer beau kissing her cheek, leaving little doubt that their relationship is still going strong.  According to a source close to the couple, the rumors of a breakup were sparked by ""jealousy and drama"" surrounding Gwen's ex-husband Gavin Rossdale. The source revealed that Blake had grown tired of Gwen's ""needy"" behavior and had decided to take some time for himself on the latter part of his month-long Country Freaks Tour.  However, a representative for Gwen has since denied the rumors, stating that the couple is still very much together.  The news comes after Gavin, Gwen's ex-husband, revealed that he and Gwen had gone through ""so much counselling"" in a bid to save their marriage. Despite their efforts, the couple finalized their divorce in April 2016 after 13 years of marriage.  Gavin has since moved on with German model Sophia Thomalla, 27, while Gwen is now dating Blake Shelton, 41.

But the male player ranked 701 in the world - Dmitry Tursunov - believes he could beat her.  Speaking to US radio station NPR, seven-time Grand Slam champion McEnroe said of former world number one Williams, who has won an Open-era record 23 Grand Slams: ""If she played the men's circuit she'd be, like, 700 in the world.""  He qualified the comments by saying: ""That doesn't mean I don't think Serena is an incredible player, and I suppose anything's possible; maybe at some point a women's tennis player can be better than anybody.""  But he added: ""I just haven't seen that in any other sport, and I haven't seen it in tennis. If she had to just play the men's circuit, it would be an entirely different story.""  Williams later responded on Twitter: ""Dear John, I adore and respect you but please please keep me out of your statements that are not factually based.  ""I've never played anyone ranked ""there"" nor do I have time. Respect me and my privacy as I'm trying to have a baby. Good day sir.""  Williams, 35, won her 23rd Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in January. It later transpired she was pregnant at the time  'She is pregnant, and I'm not'  Tursunov, 34, was once ranked as high as 20th in the world.  The Russian told BBC World Service Sport he did not think McEnroe was ""trying to talk women's tennis down"" but said ""the reality"" was that ""men are stronger in general"".  ""I would hope that I would win against Serena,"" he added.  ""It would be a similar argument to: who would run faster, the fastest woman or the fastest man? Tennis is becoming more and more a physical sport, so it's going to be hard for a woman to beat the men.  ""It's not black and white, there are lots of factors to take into account. Physically I might not be in the best shape of my life but as an overall package I'm much better than my ranking would suggest. She is pregnant, and I'm not.  ""I've never heard John say anything absolutely stupid - he knows his stuff. What he said about her being an incredible player is correct - explosive, powerful and she puts in a lot of work.

Battle of the sexes  A crowd of 30,000 watched Billie Jean King take on Bobby Riggs in Houston in 1973  Tennis matches between men and women have occurred before, mostly notably back in 1973 when Billie Jean King took on fellow American Bobby Riggs.

King originally declined to play Riggs and Australian Margaret Court - at the time the top female player in the world - stepped in. Riggs won 6-2 6-1.  But later that year, the top ranked women's player King - 26 years younger than Riggs at 29 - took him on in an exhibition match at the Houston Astrodome and won 6-4 6-3 6-3.  A third 'Battle of the Sexes' match took in 1992 between American former world number one Jimmy Connors, aged 40 at the time, and Czech and American Martina Navratilova, who was 35.

I think it would be a very interesting match.""  She said the debate over McEnroe's comments was ""a bit of a waste of time"" because ""it's not like he's said anything that's not been said before"".  ""I think it's more interesting to talk about the differences between the sexes in tennis.  "" ""The reality is that the men are stronger in general.  ""But you can't just say that and leave it at that. There are lots of other factors to take into account.""  Williams, 35, has won 23 Grand Slam titles  Williams, 35, has won 23 Grand Slam titles, more than any other woman in the Open era.  She has been ranked number one in the world on eight separate occasions and has been described as the greatest female tennis player of all time by many experts.  McEnroe, 59, was ranked number one in the world for a total of seven weeks during his career, and won seven Grand Slam titles.

gossipcop-4541624536,1,0,"Two arrests have been made in the murders of four women at Fairmont Terrace Apartments last month, police announced Wednesday afternoon.  Brothers, James Stanford Poore, 32, and Cedric Dwayne Poore, 39, were arrested and booked on four complaints each of first degree murder, Chief Chuck Jordan said.  On Monday, January 7, 2013, twin sisters Rebeika Powell and Kayetie Powell-Melchor, 23; Misty Nunley, 33, and Julie Jackson, 55 were found shot in the head, with their hands tied behind their backs inside a south Tulsa apartment, police say. A 3-year-old boy was also found inside the apartment, unharmed.  Chief Jordan said the murders were not gang-related. According to arrest reports, witnesses told investigators that the brothers left an apartment in the same building at Fairmont Terrace Apartments, near 61st and Peoria, saying they were going to pull a ""lick"" at the victims' apartment.  Witnesses told police the brothers returned about 20 minutes later with a bag full of drugs, cash, and jewelry. According to the report, James Poore told the witnesses that he shot one of the victims because she could identify him and that Cedric shot the other three. The witnesses told investigators the brothers split the money and that Cedric Poore took the jewelry to pawn.    When he was interviewed Wednesday, James Poore confirmed to investigators that he knew one of the victims and that he was in the apartment where the witnesses placed him. Before invoking his right to remain silent, he told investigators he knew one of the victims had used and sold illegal drugs and that Cedric drove a black van to the apartment the day of the murders.    The arrest report shows Cedric Poore denied being in the apartment the day of the murders and refused to speak to investigators any more.  Chief Jordan said the brothers both stayed at Fairmont Terrace Apartments. The property manager there told News On 6 that neither of them are on a lease.  Cedric Poore has been in Tulsa County jail on a traffic violation since January 14, and James Poore was arrested Wednesday morning. Department of Corrections records show both James and Cedric have been previously convicted and incarcerated for robbery with a firearm.  Chief Jordan said more arrests may still be made.  Mayor Dewey Bartlett released a statement Wednesday afternoon, in response to the news of the arrests:    ""The Tulsa Police Department is known for their quick efforts of finding perpetrators and they indeed lived up to their stellar reputation for this case. I have the utmost confidence in Chief Chuck Jordan and the Tulsa Police Department and I knew they would bring in those involved with this hideous quadruple murder in very short order. Although a direct tip from the public cannot be identified as the catalyst that led to the arrests, tips are always important, which is part of great police work from our force.""","In the meantime, the victims' families are in the thoughts and prayers of all of us here at News On 6, as they cope with this senseless act of violence.

She told the magazine:  We're not perfect, but you see these things in the media, like Kendall and Pepsi, where I see her at home crying, but in the media she looks another way because she's not addressing it. I'm just like, 'This is wrong. You need to speak up.' She was like, 'I don't ever want to show that footage of me crying.' She was trying to not make excuses or be dramatic, but that was what she was going through at the time.  We suppose the only non-family members who know the truth are those blubbering crew members then.","The Kardashian's are not perfect, but they have been a source of comfort for a nation of reality TV fans for a decade.  And for that, they deserve a round of applause.  They may have started as a family of five, but over the years they've grown and adapted to their ever-growing brood.  And though they may not always be perfect, they are always real.  They have shown us that no matter how hard we try, we will never be perfect, but that's okay.  That's life."

Which brings us, quite naturally, to Twitter.  Here's a place that's just too perfect for the nasty, uncontrolled insult.  You can hide behind your egg and toss Bons-Molotovs at anyone you choose.  Some people choose Kim Kardashian.  She's an easy target.  Her life seems effortless. She's painfully wealthy, with a TV show, branded products left and right and an appearance fee surely only rivaled by Hillary Clinton.  Hers is such a cushy life that she can listen to Kanye West any time she wants.  Small wonder, then, that a Twitter user called Kevin James offered a wry dig at her countenance.

So she brought him onto her side with something so blessedly charming that it not only made her seem entirely self-aware -- rather than merely self-absorbed -- but also must have enticed a chuckle from Kevin James himself.

gossipcop-211703249,1,0,"His sweet escape. Blake Shelton credits Gwen Stefani for getting him back on his feet following his divorce from Miranda Lambert. The country superstar opened up about his romance with the No Doubt frontwoman in a new interview with Billboard magazine.  As previously reported, Shelton told Stefani that he was splitting from Lambert during a meeting with their Voice coworkers. The “Misery” singer, who was new to the team at the time, got emotional.  “I won’t forget that day. I looked over at Gwen — who I didn’t really know — and she had these huge tears in her eyes. I thought, ‘Wow, she feels super bad for me!’” Shelton recalled. “She didn’t tell me much, because we didn’t know each other at the time, but she said, ‘I’m going through something very similar to what you’re going through. I understand. And I hate it.’”  Stefani was dealing with her own breakup at the time with Gavin Rossdale. (As Us Weekly exclusively revealed, the Bush rocker was cheating on her with their children’s nanny, Mindy Mann.) They announced they were ending their 13-year marriage in August 2015, one month after Shelton and Lambert announced they were divorcing after four years.  The “Came Here to Forget” singer and Stefani leaned on each other for support during the difficult time. The closer they got, the more Shelton saw Stefani in a new light.  “That’s kind of how our friendship and bond started, that day. It went from that, to checking in on each other once a week through email — ‘This s–t happened to me, what happened to you?’ — to maybe three times a week, then every day, to ‘Hey, here’s my phone number if you ever want to text,’” Shelton told Billboard. “Next thing I know, I wake up and she’s all I care about, and I’m ­wondering if she feels the same about me.”  “Gwen saved my life,” he added. “Who else on earth could understand going through a high-profile divorce from another musician? You can’t even imagine the similarities in our divorces.”  The two teamed up professionally too. Shelton included their collaborative track, “Go Ahead and Break My Heart,” on his 12th studio album, If I’m Honest.  “When we recorded the vocals for some of these songs, I was only six months removed from when all the crap went down,” Shelton said of his split from Lambert. “When you have a broken heart — at least, when I do — you got to get it out of your system. You want people to sympathize with you.

In addition to her net worth, she has a highly coveted position in the world of magazine publishing. She has also served as the (albeit not very flattering) inspiration for the popular novel and movie The Devil Wears Prada. Her career began in the world of fashion before moving into journalism, largely at the behest of her parents. In the year 1970, Wintour was hired on as an editorial assistant for the new Harper's & Queen fashion magazine. Even at this early stage of her career, Wintour divulged to coworkers that she had the desire to edit Vogue, a desire that would grow to be fulfilled nearly 20 years later. Wintour introduced sweeping changes to Vogue from her first issue forward. Many of these changes could be seen right on the cover. Wintour favored more naturalistic photography of lesser-known models outside, as opposed to the tight headshots the magazine had previously favored. Additionally, Wintour's first Vogue cover was also the first to feature a model wearing jeans, with the added bonus of wearing a bejeweled T-shirt valued at around $10,000. Under Wintour, Vogue has continued to be one of the pillars of fashion journalism.","Wintour has been hailed as one of the most powerful women in fashion. Wintour was born in London in 1949, the daughter of Charles Wintour, who was editor of the Evening Standard. She was educated at Queen's Gate School, where she developed an interest in fashion at an early age. In 1967, Wintour began working at Harper's & Queen, where she met her future husband, David Shaffer. The two were married in 1984. Wintour's younger daughter, Bee Shaffer, currently works at Vogue as an editor. In 2018, Wintour was named as the most powerful woman in fashion by Forbes magazine. The passage has been rewritten to make it more convincing by using more sophisticated language, such as 'albeit not very flattering' and 'pillars of fashion journalism'. The tone has been adjusted to be more serious and informative, while still conveying the same information as the original passage."

Jennifer Lopez is not in a hurry to walk down the aisle with Alex Rodriguez, but she does want to spend the rest of her life with someone.  “I do believe in marriage,” the Shades of Blue actress, 48, told Harper’s Bazaar in a story published on Thursday, March 15. “And I would love to grow old with somebody in a committed relationship. But I’m not forcing anything right now.”  As far as her relationship with the 42-year-old former Yankees player, she said: “It’s good, it’s healthy; we communicate well. We understand each other’s lives in a way that most other people couldn’t.”  She added: “We both entered the public eye in our early twenties and overachieved right from the start. And that affects every dynamic in your life, from your family to your work to your relationships. We have a similar makeup.”  The pair celebrated their anniversary in February in Minneapolis, where the singer performed a concert ahead of the Super Bowl. During the show, she debuted her single “Us” written by Poo Bear and produced by Skrillex, and dedicated it to Rodriguez, who was in the audience. “We’ve been together for one year today. I don’t want to get all mushy or anything, but baby, this song’s for you. I love you,” she told the athlete while on stage.  When talking about how she chose the song, Lopez told the magazine that the lyrics fit right into where the couple were in their relationship. She said: “They played me about 20 different songs, and when I heard this one I was like, ‘Oh, this is relevant!’ Alex and I were just getting to know each other. And I was like, ‘Oh, my God, could this be? Could this be us?’”  Lopez was previously married to chef Ojani Noa for nearly a year in 1997, and dancer Cris Judd from 2001 to 2002. She later married singer Marc Anthony in 2004 and they called it quits in 2011. The pair share 10-year-old twins Max and Emme.

A lot has changed in the “Dance Again” songstress’ life since her last relationship, and she said a lot of it has to do with really knowing herself. “When I was younger I spent a lot of time being half happy and half not happy,” she told the publication. “I know who I am and what I want. I also know my strengths and weaknesses. It took me a long time to get to a point where I could say something nice about myself. I’m glad I can do that now.”  Lopez remains optimistic as she continues with her career, raise her two children and make her relationship with Rodriguez work for the long run. “Baseball is just like life,” she said. “All you want to do is hit a home run.”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!","Now, rewrite the passage to make it more convincing:  Jennifer Lopez is not in a rush to walk down the aisle with Alex Rodriguez, but she is eager to spend the rest of her life with someone special.

The use of the word ""saddened"" to describe the National Association of Black Journalists' reaction to Hall's departure suggests a neutral tone. The author also acknowledges NBC's history of diversity and inclusion, which adds credibility to their statement.  However, some readers may interpret the phrase ""whitewashing"" as sensationalist.

gossipcop-5658990975,1,0,"Daniel Craig is returning as James Bond once again, even as he reportedly fights to save his marriage to Rachel Weisz at the same time. Craig has already announced his intent to return as 007 in the franchise’s 25th film, and according to the National Enquirer, he’s still struggling to salvage what’s left of his marriage.  The Enquirer’s source claimed at the beginning of 2017, “Rachel and Daniel haven’t been happy for a while, and nearly called it quits last year.” The report claims that the married couple was in two separate filming locations at the beginning of the year, but continued to stay apart even after wrapping their respective films. The Enquirer then claims that they finally reunited in July after not being seen together in ‘554 days’.  According to the sources, the minute the outlet attempted to lock down an exclusive on the couple’s rocky marriage, both Rachel Weisz and Daniel Craig were seen arriving at New York’s Public Theater the next day, prompting the source to add, “The whole thing just seemed like too much of a coincidence. I don’t buy it for a minute.”  When you consider Daniel Craig’s own words, especially in the context of allegedly turning down a $150 million payday to star in two more James Bond films, he had stated, “Being on your own would be sad, sick, and weird. I don’t trust myself. I need that balance.” If these reports are to be believed, then Daniel Craig previously turned down starring in more Bond films to spend time with his family, but now – all of a sudden – he’s back to working on James Bond?  Either the report was never accurate to begin with, or he’s giving up on his marriage to Rachel Weisz. One would hope that the two have worked out whatever was troubling them in the first place, but given their own relationship and marriage histories – and how they’ve both jumped ship on long-term relationships at the drop of a hat – one wouldn’t be faulted for assuming that they are on their way to getting a divorce.  What do you guys think? Are Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz having marriage troubles, and is Daniel’s decision to take on the role of 007 again an indication that he’s giving up on his marriage? Or just a chance to have more career stability and/or cash in on a major paycheck? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.

gossipcop-4774142356,1,0,"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired. T","aking a break from her acting career, Holmes spent much of her time since the split focusing on her daughter, Suri, and working on her own projects, including her company, Holmes & Hole, a lifestyle brand that she launched in 2015.  While there have been no further updates on Holmes’ relationship with Foxx, the Radar story has raised questions about whether the two are truly over for good.  It's important to note that neither Holmes nor Foxx has publicly confirmed the breakup, and Holmes' publicist, Leslie Sloane, did not return requests for comment.  In any case, the story serves as a reminder of how the media can shape our perceptions of celebrities and their personal lives."

Childhood pal Ninaki Priddy opened up about Prince Harry's fiancée, claiming her desire to be famous outweighed her commitment to her marriage to film producer Trevor Engelson.  Meghan married her ex back in 2011 on a Jamaican beach. They split two years later after she landed her role in Suits, which filmed in Toronto. Previously it was thought the pair grew apart after Meghan spent months filming in Canada and her beau was based in LA.  Ninaki says otherwise.  (Image: Getty Images North America)  (Image: REX/Shutterstock)  ""The way she handled it, Trevor definitely had the rug pulled out from under him. He was hurt,"" she said, explaining that while Trevor was heartbroken, Meghan was less affected,"" she told Mail Online.  Prior to their split, Ninaki - who was maid of honour at the wedding - said the pair doted on each other and Trevor would have done anything for the actress.  ""Then, after the wedding, it was like a light switched off. There’s Meghan before fame and Meghan after fame. After three seasons of Suits, she called me to say the marriage was over.  The pair first met aged two at Hollywood’s private Little Red School House before they went to the Immaculate Heart girls’ high school in Los Angeles at the age of 11.  Following a close friendship that she describes as 'sisterly', Ninaki says the pair eventually fell out over how Meghan and ex-husband - who the ex Suits star met when she was just 23 - split.  She explains she went to visit Trevor who was heartbroken over their split, while Meghan seemed less affected.

""I think it’s a very fanciful dream to believe that you just walk into a Prince Charming.  ""I know the Royal Family was something she found fascinating. She had one of Princess Diana’s books [Diana: Her True Story] on her bookshelf, and even when she was with Trevor she told me she wanted to go and stay in London for at least a month.""  She added: ""I wasn’t shocked or even surprised to hear about Prince Harry. I know she used to love The Princess Diaries — films about a commoner who becomes part of a Royal Family.

gossipcop-1551062653,1,0,"  George Clooney and his wife, Amal, attend the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. (Alberto Pizzoli/AFP via Getty Images)  Once the ultimate bachelor — and two-time People’s Sexiest Man Alive cover model — George Clooney entered entirely new territory this week.  The Oscar-winning actor and his human-rights-lawyer wife of two years, Amal, announced Tuesday that they are the proud new parents of twins, Ella and Alexander.  Clooney has donned many hats in his life — actor, director, producer and activist, but fatherhood had always seemed far away. Was it the early-onset-salt-and-pepper hair? The coterie of models who found themselves on his arm for fleeting moments over the years? The insistence by tabloids and fellow co-stars that it was time for him to settle down? Maybe. Or perhaps it was the simple fact that Clooney himself said again and again that he would not reproduce. In several interviews. Many, many times. For many, many years.  A first-time father at 56, Clooney was often asked throughout his career whether the single life was his ultimate future. But after proposing marriage to Amal in April 2014 and marrying her that September (as well as sharing wedding photos with People magazine in the United States and Hello magazine in Britain), it seemed as if anything was possible for the man who once said, “I don’t see myself ever having kids.”  But it was a long road to get there. “I don’t have that gene that people have to replicate,” he told People in 2006.  When Esquire asked him why he wasn’t married with kids, he replied, “I haven’t had aspirations in that way, ever.” And as for people who thought it was weird that a man in his 50s was single and childless? “What do you do? Should I go, ‘I got to get me some kids right now!’ and rush out and impregnate someone?”  Clooney seemed to express frustration when asked how he could ever relate to the fathers he occasionally portrays onscreen. His answer: “Well, I’m also not running for president, but I played that role in ‘Ides of March.’ I wasn’t an actual lawyer when I did ‘Michael Clayton,’ and I don’t fire people for a living like I did in ‘Up in the Air.’ ”  “I keep saying I’ll never get married again or have children but people just don’t want to believe me,” Clooney told Britain’s Daily Express just three months before popping the question to his now-wife.  Of course, celebrities are people, too, and it shouldn’t surprise anyone that a man might change his mind around the midcentury mark. And Clooney is certainly not alone in choosing to wait till later in life to welcome a child into the family: Comedian Steve Martin became a father at age 67 in 2012; Elton John was 63 when he had a baby via a surrogate in 2010; and Chris Noth was 53 when he welcomed his only child in 2008.  Perhaps it’s the fact that Clooney always seemed so delightfully and devilishly Clooney-ish that made his bachelordom seem like the only constant in our ever-changing popular culture. But we can rest easy knowing that despite some hesitation about having a family over the years, his sense of humor has remained steady throughout.  “Ella, Alexander and Amal are all healthy, happy and doing fine,” the statement announcing the birth of the twins read. “George is sedated and should recover in a few days.”","Clooney’s rep later clarified that the actor is, in fact, “ecstatic” about the arrival of his twins. So there you have it. One of Hollywood’s most eligible bachelors has finally found his match — and he’s already a dad of two."

Gossip Cop can reveal what’s going on.  “Ed Sheeran Gushes Over Taylor Swift’s Nemesis Katy Perry — Breaking Friend Code?” asks the pot-stirrers at HollywoodLife. The webloid writes, “Cover your ears, Taylor Swift! The singer’s longtime BFF, Ed Sheeran, crashed her nemesis, Katy Perry’s, BBC Radio 1 interview on Feb. 22… and he had nothing but great things to say about the 32-year-old.”  The site goes on to say, “So, of course, we have to wonder how Taylor feels about this — although she’s never confirmed it, Katy is totally the subject of her song ‘Bad Blood,’ and their feud has played out in the public eye since 2014. Ed may be getting a phone call from his bestie sometime soon…”","But here’s the thing: There is no “friendship code” to “break” in the first place! It’s all just a silly myth perpetuated by the tabloids. In reality, Ed and Taylor are just two musicians who have collaborated on music, nothing more. They’ve worked together on a song and they respect each other as artists, but they’re not “besties” or anything. And as for Katy, she’s not even involved in this non-feud! So, let’s all just calm down and stop spreading fake drama.

REP. DEVIN NUNES: The big felony in all of this that nobody talks about from the very beginning was the leak of highly classified information when they leaked the phone call of the Russian ambassador talking to General Mike Flynn right before the inauguration. That was a felony, nothing’s ever been done about it.    BARTIROMO: Is your office investigating this sir?    SESSIONS: That is a violation of the law, to leak classified documents and it is being investigated. I will say this, the last two years before I became Attorney General there were each year there were three open investigations of classified leaks now we have 27 we’re going after this aggressively. I am directing it personally, some of the matters involve this matter and some of it is a matter I am not recused on and we’re pursuing it aggressively.","I rewrote the passage to make it more convincing by adding more details and examples to support the information provided by Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

According to Deadline, the Bridesmaids star is being considered to play Cheetah, a classic comic-book villain, in the upcoming highly anticipated movie sequel. Wiig, who is mostly known for her comedy chops, would be the adversary to Gal Gadot’s Diana Prince. This time the superhero has skipped ahead in time from World War II to fight crime in the 1980s. Cheetah, who was originally depicted as the alter ego of a socialite, will probably fit right in with Reagan’s America. Though, then again, since this is the Cold War she could suddenly become a Soviet. Patty Jenkins is also returning as the film’s director.","This is the first time Wiig and Gadot will be working together, but they have already been spotted together at the studio. So, if Wiig signs on to play the villain, this could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship. The article is about an actress who is being considered for a role in a movie sequel. The actress is Kristen Wiig and the movie is Wonder Woman. The article provides information on the actress's previous work and the role she is being considered for, which is that of Cheetah, a classic comic book villain.

The chemistry between the two actors was undeniable, and their natural ease and comfort with each other was evident in the way they interacted. As they chatted and laughed, Lady Gaga playfully tucked her hand into Cooper's, and he affectionately squeezed her hand, leaving little doubt about the depth of their relationship.
As they made their way through the festival, Lady Gaga and Cooper were bombarded with questions about their on-screen chemistry and their real-life relationship. Lady Gaga, ever the consummate professional, deftly deflected attention from her personal life, instead focusing on the film's themes of love, loss, and redemption. Cooper, too, was tight-lipped about their relationship, but his eyes betrayed a hint of pride and admiration for his co-star. As the pair concluded their press conference and bid each other farewell, it was clear that their mutual admiration and respect for each other extended far beyond the confines of the film set."

gossipcop-7658353025,1,0,"“A Star Is Born” is that thing we always yearn for but so rarely get to see: a transcendent Hollywood movie. It’s the fourth remake of a story that dates back to 1932, but this one has a look and vibe all its own — rapturous and swooning, but also delicate and intimate and luminous. It’s set in the present day, but in spirit it’s a sophisticated retro ’70s drama built around the uncanny flow of feeling that develops between the movie’s two stars: Bradley Cooper, who plays Jackson Maine, a hard-drinking, bad-ol’-boy redneck rock ‘n’ roller who is still hanging on as a popular attraction but has lost the lust for what he’s doing, and Lady Gaga, in her fetching and accomplished movie-star debut, as Ally, an ingenuous, fresh-faced singer-songwriter who becomes his lover and stage partner before rocketing on her own into the new pop stratosphere. She takes off as he slowly crashes — that’s the soapy tragic “Star Is Born” concept. But what the movie does is to take this fabled melodramatic romantic seesaw and turn it into something indelibly heartfelt and revealing. Cooper directed the movie himself, working from a script he co-wrote with Eric Roth and Will Fetters, and to say that he does a good job would be to understate his accomplishment. As a filmmaker, Bradley Cooper gets right onto the high wire, staging scenes that take their time and play out with a shaggy intimacy that’s shorn of the usual “beats.” The new “Star Is Born” is a total emotional knockout, but it’s also a movie that gets you to believe, at every step, in the complicated rapture of the story it’s telling. More Reviews Venice Film review: 'Isis, Tomorrow. The Lost Souls of Mosul' Telluride Film Review: 'They'll Love Me When I'm Dead' The 1976 version, starring Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson, had some terrific cornball love songs, but they didn’t belong anywhere near the stadium-rock stage, and neither did Streisand, which is part of why the movie came off as borderline ludicrous. It seemed stranded, with a kind of campy sincere ineptitude, between three worlds: Old Hollywood, New Hollywood, and Barbra Streisand rock-princess fantasy. But from the electrifying opening moments of the new version, in which Jackson, boozy and raw, with his sunburned squint and hard-bitten shit-kicker sexiness, takes the stage of a gigantic stadium and launches into a grinding slow rocker that sounds like “Victim of Love”-era Eagles as done by the Allman Brothers, the movie is thrillingly authentic. That’s no minor accomplishment. Hollywood almost never succeeds in nailing the rock world, but “A Star Is Born,” though a love story through and through, is the most lived-in rock ‘n’ roll movie since “Almost Famous.” And that absolute looks right, sounds right, feels right verisimilitude sets the stage for everything that follows. Jackson, who looks to be in his mid-40s, has been around long enough that he now occupies a grey zone between legend and nostalgia. He can still fill an arena full of screaming fans, and his old hits have become classic-rock chestnuts, but his sound and persona have long slipped out of the zeitgeist. His whole outlaw look — the beard and rancher’s hat, the Kristofferson-meets-Skynyrd soused macho twinkle — mark him as a charismatic relic, and the grand irony is this: What that look, and sound, are all about is an era when rock ‘n’ roll strutted its “authenticity,” but now that he’s out of date, Jackson’s authenticity looks more than ever like a showbiz conceit, frozen in amber. It’s a part he’s playing, an image he’s working — and secretly struggling — to keep alive. He’s got a signature ballad that goes “Maybe it’s time to let the old ways die,” and when he wrote it (long ago), he probably didn’t know that he was talking about himself. In the first of many telling jump cuts, the film leaps from his on-stage glory to Jackson slinking into the back of his car, weary and alone, grabbing the bottle of gin he’s got stashed there. He takes a guzzle, and Coop",", ready to go, she finds that he’s left her alone. He’s not coming back. Jackson, who’s on the verge of losing his job, has a new gig in three days, and he’s going to take it. He doesn’t know why he can’t be with her. The movie is about to reveal to us why, but first it has to establish the odd-couple chemistry of its two stars. So it leaves us with a flashback of Jackson and Ally together at his house, singing his song (“I’ll Fight”) in the dim-lit basement, Jackson, with his arms folded and his face averted, bellowing out the verses in a voice that sounds, in this context, like the deepest, most authentic thing he’s ever sung, while Ally, standing close, holds the microphone and offers the soaring chorus, her voice spinning upward to an unearthly height that can only be called divine. (It’s a showstopper, and they both know it.) They’re not just singing a song. They’re making a deal with the universe, a Faustian pact in which they trade a little of their souls for the chance to make their dreams come true. When the scene ends, you feel that you’ve witnessed something cosmic and holy. The song is the title of the movie."

Years later, Brad regrets leaving the Friends star for his now-ex Angelina Jolie, a source told In Touch exclusively.  Following his 2016 separation from Angie, Brad sobered up and sought therapy. And now, he’s “in touch with emotions and his true self like never before,” the source says.  Brad Pitt finally opens up about his bitter divorce with Angelina Jolie  And it seems like this self-awareness comes with some great realisations. “He has come to realise that leaving Jen for Angelina was one of the biggest mistakes of his life,” the source adds. “And while he’s not in love with Jen, he realises how much he does love her. Brad keeps telling friends that he’s seeing everything more clearly.”  However, these realisations are obviously far too late.

gossipcop-4241884018,1,0,"In the past, Kanye’s capriciousness has been repeatedly forgiven and, at times, belatedly rewarded with accolades. It is hard to imagine a My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy — one of the greatest rap albums of all time — without an “Imma let you finish” at the 2009 VMAs.  His new album, ye, doesn’t merit any similar mercy.  On first listen, it doesn’t sound like any part of ye was recorded pre-MAGA hat picture, which blows a Kanye-head sized hole through the argument that the previous month’s behavior was a publicity stunt to promote the album. If anything, the album seems like an meek afterthought to the Twitter tirade and dive into right-wing politics. Most of it deals with the repercussions of the storm which came before it, and for the first time in his career, the artist’s personality is overwhelming the art.  The opening track ‘I Thought About Killing You’, if played in a vacuum, sounds like the work of a troubled mind. If a poem like this came from a loved one, it would surely merit discussion about a trip to the therapist. Kanye goes on to deliver cringe-worthy rhymes on issues ranging from Russell Simmons rape allegations to his petrification on realizing that his daughter might one day look like his wife. He teases a few tidbits of The Old Kanye, chopping up beats from Slick Rick and The Edwin Hawkins Singers samples on ‘No Mistakes’, to keep his fans just interested enough. It’s telling that the one standout track, ‘Ghost Town’ is the track on which Kanye lurks in the background, devoting more time on production than on spoken word, and letting John Legend and Kid Cudi take over.  If one were to ignore everything that came before ye, it would still feel like Kanye didn’t even try this time. The usual meticulousness and perfectionism has apparently been supplanted by a Kanye shrug. The music is haphazard and hollow, mirroring the guy making it. Maybe he’s become blasé and doesn’t want to spend time on music anymore. He did say he wanted to run for President in 2020 (or 2024?) anyway.","The one time Kanye has spoken about the album, he mentions how he is “just making music for himself now”. If so, that’s a shame, as he used to be good at it."

Lisa Kudrow has offered up even more proof that the cast of “Friends” took the name of the beloved sitcom to heart.  On Monday, the actress told People that her co-stars altered a pre-show ritual when she was pregnant during Seasons 4 and 5 to include her unborn child — her now 20-year-old son, Julian Murray Stern.  “The six of us would do a huddle backstage and just say, ‘All right, have a good show, love you love you love you love you,’” Kudrow, 55, told the outlet. “And when I was pregnant, then they would say, ‘Have a great show, love you love you — love you, little Julian!’ ’Cause we knew it was a boy and that was his name.”  She added: “So sweet, they included my little fetus in the huddle.”  The stars of “Friends” embraced one another’s children at other times, too. In 2005, Jennifer Aniston was named godmother of Courteney Cox’s daughter, Coco Arquette.","Your task is to rewrite the given passage in a more convincing and serious tone, while maintaining the same content.

Lisa Kudrow has recently shared yet another testament to the tight-knit bond between the cast of the iconic sitcom ""Friends."" During an interview with People, the actress revealed that her co-stars went to great lengths to include her unborn child in their pre-show rituals during Seasons 4 and 5. ""The six of us would gather backstage and exchange words of encouragement, ending each huddle with the standard 'love you, love you, love you, love you,'"" Kudrow, now 55, recalled. ""But when I was pregnant, they changed the phrase to include my soon-to-be-born son, Julian Murray Stern. 'Have a great show, love you, love you – love you, little Julian!' they would say with a smile.""  Kudrow's heartwarming account highlights the deep affection and support that characterized the ""Friends"" cast's dynamic. It is not surprising, given the show's enduring popularity and the indelible mark it left on popular culture. The cast's ability to connect with one another and their fans on a personal level undoubtedly contributed to the show's success and longevity.  As Kudrow noted, the cast's inclusivity extended beyond the show's production. In 2005, Jennifer Aniston was appointed godmother of Courteney Cox's daughter, Coco Arquette, further solidifying the bonds of friendship and camaraderie between the cast members.  The ""Friends"" cast's commitment to one another and their shared art form is a testament to the power of collaboration and mutual respect in the entertainment industry. As fans continue to cherish the show's legacy, they can take comfort in knowing that the cast's warmth and compassion extend beyond the screen and into their personal lives."

Together, they have the same kind of joys and sorrows that just about every teenager has while growing up. This show parodied many of the attitudes, events and fads of the 70s, along with those who grew up at the time. Written by Jean-Marc Rocher <rocher@fiberbit.net>","Rewritten passage:
As a high school student in Wisconsin in 1976, Eric Forman's life was not unlike that of many of his peers. He navigated the ups and downs of adolescence alongside his family and friends, experiencing the same range of emotions and challenges that are a hallmark of the teenage years. However, what set Eric apart was his proximity to the cultural touchstones of the 1970s, which the hit TV show ""That '70s Show"" would later parody with characteristic wit and humor. From the fashion trends and music fads to the political and social issues of the time, the show captured the essence of an era and the people who grew up during it. Written by Jean-Marc Rocher."
gossipcop-1578034404,1,0,"Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin recently got engaged after a month of dating (Summer 2018 strikes again!), and now the internet is speculating about WHY they're rushing into marriage.  The obvious answer is that Justin and Hailey are in love and want to spend forever together, but there's also a rumor lurking in some corners of the internet (read: Twitter) claiming that Hailey's pregnant. Which, to be clear, is definitely not anyone's business, and is also pretty sexist!  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  That aside, a pap caught up with Justin while he was buying coffee, and made the mistake of asking him about the rumors, saying ""Is Hailey pregnant right now? You stated that you guys are family, so everybody was thinking she might be pregnant.""  Justin's response? To stop in his tracks and call this dude out, saying ""What’s your deal, bro? You just seem too like, you just seem too normal to be doing this job... I just don’t understand why you gotta try to get a rise, you know what I’m saying?"" He also said ""No, you know what you’re doing"" when the pap tried to defend himself, and eventually asked for the camera to be turned off.

gossipcop-1716370499,1,1,"Dakota Johnson; most of us know her as the actress from Fifty Shades of Grey. While we may have seen Johnson in some pretty intimate positions on-screen, there’s definitely a lot we don’t know about the Fifty Shades star. Like, for instance, the superfluity of familiar names in her family tree. Seeing that her popular movie, Fifty Shades Darker came out on the day of love—Valentine's Day—it's only fitting to dedicate a piece to the actress who brought us the sexy and quaint, Anastasia Steele. Johnson, after all, has become somewhat something of a Valentine’s Day staple, herself. Here are 15 facts about Dakota Johnson or, as some might call her, ""that girl from Fifty Shades of Grey."" We guarantee that she will no longer by ""that girl"" by the end of the list! 15 Her Family Tree Is Full Of Famous Faces You know how we said there are a few familiar names in her family tree? Well, we weren’t lying. Her parents are fellow actors, Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson. Unfortunately, her parents divorced in 1994 so Dakota had to split her time between the two. ""It was the only way that I could be with them,"" she said in an interview for Cosmopolitan. ""And since they were divorced, I would spend two weeks with one and two weeks with the other, traveling with a tutor."" But wait, it gets better. Her maternal grandmother (can you guess..) is Hitchcock actress Tippi Hedren. Yes, that’s right, so clearly creative talent lies in that family. We’ve never heard of a family tree with so many famous names! Thanksgiving is probably a whirlwind. Now, Dakota Johnson is another famous name in that tree. 14 She’s An Animal Rights Activist advertising Just like her grandmother Tippi Hedren, Dakota Johnson is also an animal rights activist. Like grandmother, like granddaughter shall we say? As animal lovers ourselves, we’re pleased to hear that she’s following in her grandmother’s footsteps—both in acting and in animal rights. In 2014, Johnson saved 12 horses from being slaughtered by paying for them. What a sweet thing to do! We bet her grandmother was really proud. It’s always so great to hear about celebrities doing positive things - so naturally, we’re happy to hear of Dakota’s compassionate side. We admit we have a soft spot for animal lovers, but who doesn't? We always love hearing about people doing good deeds for animals and it’s always nice to hear celebrities using their celebrity title for the better. 13 She Grew Up Shooting Guns And Riding Horses In Colorado She may play the innocent and naive Anastasia Steele in the Fifty Shades movies, but growing up Johnson was anything but naive. She grew up in Colorado at her dad’s house, where she learned to build a fire, ride a horse, ride motorbikes, and even shoot a gun. And this was all before she was just 10 years old! Sounds like a badass kid to us! But when she wasn’t at her father’s house, she was at her mom’s house in L.A. which she also loved. It's hard to imagine a 10 year old these days shooting guns, riding motorbikes, or building fires without being grounded. But it sounds like she had a pretty inspiring and freeing childhood which makes us fall for the actress all the more. 12 She Never Dates advertising By the header, we mean she never has casual relationships. She only has long-term relationships. Good for her, is all we can say! You hear of so many celebrities who are constantly dating other celebrities. You can barely keep up with who they’re dating these days. It seems to be one guy or girl after another. So it’s great to hear of Dakota’s conservative views on relationships. Apparently she’s only ever been in long-term, serious relationships; she doesn’t just date. That probably explains why she’s been in a relationship with model Matthew Hitt since 2014. Yes, it’s been a kind of an on-and-off relationship but they’ve been in it for the long haul so far. So, to sum up, we like her whole dating attitude. The commitment is great and saves you a lot of time. 11 She HATED School It seems l","us, no matter what level of success we reach. And it’s good to know that Dakota Johnson is just as human as the rest of us when it comes to auditioning. 9 Her First Kiss Was With A Girl advertising Dakota Johnson’s first kiss was with a girl. This is not news to anyone who has followed her career or her life in the public eye. However, for those of you who are new to the world of Dakota Johnson, this is something worth mentioning. While her on-screen kisses with Jamie Dornan in Fifty Shades of Grey are anything but a secret, it’s nice to hear that her real-life kisses are just as interesting. Now, it’s worth noting that she doesn’t identify as a lesbian, and her sexuality is something that she keeps private. However, it’s nice to know that she’s explored all sides of her sexuality, and that her first kiss was with a girl. 8 She Was A Bridesmaid At Her Parents’ Wedding advertising Dakota Johnson was a bridesmaid at her parents’ wedding. We’re pretty sure that’s a sentence you never thought you’d read, but here we are! It’s a bit of an interesting fact to file away, isn’t it? Especially when you consider that her parents are two of Hollywood’s most famous actors. But hey, it’s nice to know that even celebrities have normal family experiences sometimes. And this fact just adds to the coziness of it all. 7 She’s Been In Love Three Times advertising Dakota Johnson has been in love three times. Now, this may not be the most surprising fact about her, given that she’s an actress who has been in the public eye for a while now. However, it’s nice to know that she’s had a few serious relationships under her belt. And who knows, maybe one of these days she’ll find that perfect someone and settle down for good. Or maybe she’ll keep on dating and never find anyone she wants to settle down with. Either way, it’s nice to know that she’s had a few love experiences under her belt. 6 She Was A Fashion Model Before Acting advertising Before Dakota Johnson became an actress, she was a fashion model. And not just any fashion model, but one who appeared in campaigns for major brands like Calvin Klein and Miu Miu. It’s interesting to think about how different her career might have been if she had stuck with modeling instead of acting. But hey, we’re glad she chose acting instead. After all, she’s proven to be a talented and versatile actress, and we’re sure she would have made a great model as well. 5 She’s An Only Child advertising Dakota Johnson is an only child. Now, this may not be the most interesting fact about her, but it’s worth mentioning nonetheless. Being an only child can have a big impact on a person’s life, and it’s interesting to see how that impacts Dakota’s personality and behavior. And hey, maybe one day she’ll have some kids of her own and pass on her famous genes to them! 4 She’s A Vegetarian advertising Dakota Johnson is a vegetarian. Now, this may not be the most surprising fact about her, given that a lot of celebrities are vegetarians these days. But hey, it’s still worth mentioning. And it’s interesting to see how her dietary choices affect her lifestyle and behavior. Maybe one day she’ll start a vegan food line or something! 3 She’s A Cancer advertising Dakota Johnson is a Cancer. Now, this may not be the most interesting fact about her, but it’s worth mentioning nonetheless. And hey, maybe one day she’ll write a book about her experiences as a Cancer or something! 2 She’s Worth Over $10 Million advertising Dakota Johnson is worth over $10 million. Now, this may not be the most surprising fact about her, given that she’s an actress who has appeared in major movies like Fifty Shades of Grey. But hey, it’s still worth mentioning. And it’s interesting to see how her net worth affects her lifestyle and behavior. Maybe one day she’ll buy a private island or something! 1 She’s Been Nominated For Two Teen Choice Awards advertising Dakota Johnson has been nominated for two Teen Choice Awards. Now, this may not be the most surprising fact about her, given that she’s an actress who has appeared in major movies like Fifty Shades of Grey. But hey, it’s still worth mentioning. And it’s interesting to see how her awards affect her lifestyle and behavior. Maybe one day she’ll win an Oscar or something!"

gossipcop-9811720113,1,0,"I, at least, struggle to understand her career. Her performance as a junkie in “The Town” features the “Bride Wars” of Boston accents. Her performance in “The Age of Adaline” — as a woman “cursed” to stay 30 forever — was like watching a mermaid ride a bike. She tries. But her acting hasn’t yet caught up to her algorithm-generated beauty. Alas, there may be no algorithmic solution for that.  So I was less than psyched at the prospect of seeing her shiver on a buoy, stitch her own wounds, talk to animals or play a Nancy. And, as refreshing as it is watching her stand on a surfboard, it’s refreshment that provides some perspective. While some actors make sense on movie screens, there are others who might make better sense on a can of something — beer, beans, air. I can hear you, Hudson skeptics. And all I can say is that the heart wants what the heart wants. I’d actually buy whatever Ms. Hudson was on the can of.  There might be no appreciable industrial difference between what a Kate Hudson can do versus your Blake Livelys. I don’t think they’re interchangeable, but sometimes the movies beg to differ, and the market corrects itself. Don’t fall in love with Mark Harmon, because here comes Kevin Costner. And sell your Brad Rowe stock, because he’s just going to be replaced by Brad Pitt. (In the late 1990s, that pretty much happened.) But there are continuums, too. Channing Tatum, for instance, is a more elastic, hip-hop-era Brendan Fraser upgrade.  Lots of parts that have gone to Ms. Lively feel as if Ms. Hudson could have played them. But something happened, and suddenly it was someone else’s turn to be “it.” (It’s always someone else’s turn.) And part of what annoys me about the lack of Kate Hudson in my life and the surfeit of Ms. Lively is the same thing that makes me angry when a perfectly good piece of software gets a superfluous update, or a zealous waiter takes my plate at a restaurant: I wasn’t done with that.","I was in the middle of something. And so, I’m left to ponder the unanswerable question: What is the point of it all? The Oscar-winning performances of Meryl Streep, the comedic timing of Tina Fey, the stunning beauty of Julia Roberts, the action heroism of Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, the heartthrob status of Zac Efron, the artistic vision of Martin Scorsese, the blockbuster success of J.J. Abrams, the genre-busting ingenuity of Guillermo del Toro, the riveting dramatic performances of Denzel Washington, the box office clout of Disney, the critical acclaim of Ava DuVernay, the cult following of Quentin Tarantino, the global reach of Tom Cruise, the intergenerational appeal of Christopher Nolan, the unpredictability of Bong Joon-ho, the anthropological curiosity of Spike Lee, the institutional memory of Steven Spielberg, the enduring appeal of Harrison Ford, the irrepressible energy of Robert Downey Jr., the fearlessness of Ryan Gosling, the meticulous craftsmanship of Christopher Nolan, the transcendental power of film, the illusory nature of reality, the haunting beauty of the movies.  I'm not sure why I feel this way, but I do. I guess I’m just one of those people who want to be entertained, but also want to be moved, to be challenged, to be awed, to be inspired. And I don’t know if that’s too much to ask."

When model Tati Neves, 26, was asked if she kissed the Baby singer , she coyly answered: ""What do you think, if I was sleeping in the bedroom, just me and him?""  That really clears it up then.  Before the interview on Brazilian TV the model allegedly told friends she saw Bieber smoke weed and spent the night with him.  On Globo TV's Fantastico she was asked if she saw a bevy of girls arrive at 3am the same night, believed to bussed in from a nearby club, she replied: ""No. So, I'd already gone into the bedroom with him.""  She also claimed she had taken the video of Bieber asleep, with his beloved baseball cap nearby, the following morning after waking up first.  (Image: Youtube)  She said: ""I was sleeping, and woke up, he was sleeping and I was speaking with a girlfriend.""  Tati, who appears naked on some adult Brazilian websites, is thought to have met Bieber in the Centaurus club in Rio which is notorious for being a brothel.  But Marcus Mion, the owner of the Zax Club in the Barra da Tijuca neighborhood, disputed the model's account.  He said Ms Neves wasn't among the 30 girls the singer chose to go back with him to his rented villa.  (Image: Youtube)  He said: ""I know all the girls who went. I personally went round asking inviting them on behalf of Justin, and I put each one in the van that took them there.""

Speculation has been rife since the model allegedly told friends she saw Bieber smoke marijuana and spend the night with him at a Rio nightclub.  However, when pressed on the matter during the interview, Neves adopted a coy and evasive tone, suggesting that the nature of her encounter with Bieber was far from clear-cut.  ""What do you think, if I was sleeping in the bedroom, just me and him?"" she teased, before hastily adding that she had taken the video of Bieber asleep the following morning after waking up first.  Despite the model's reluctance to provide a straightforward answer, it is widely believed that Neves and Bieber did share a night together at the Centaurus club in Rio.

gossipcop-6722352082,1,0,"Carlotta is a fictional character from Gaston Leroux's 1909 novel The Phantom of the Opera.  In the novel, she is a minor character hailing from Spain. The first time that she is mentioned in the novel is during the chapter ""The New Marguerite"", where it is revealed that she could not perform at the ceremony for the former managers. Later in the novel, she is threatened by Erik that if she performs at the Opera House ""a great misfortune will strike"". She shrugs the warning off and performs anyway. When she does, however, croaking noises come out of her mouth and the chandelier comes crashing down. Ashamed, she hides from the public view for a few weeks, before making a return to the opera house.  Carlotta is portrayed by Virginia Pearson in the original 1925 silent film with Lon Chaney. In 1929, new sound scenes were filmed and Mary Fabian was recast as Carlotta, due to the fact that she could sing. Virginia Pearson still appeared in new scenes, now playing Carlotta's mother. These changes are also the same in the 1929 silent, foreign cut of the film (which is most commonly viewed).  In the 1943 film version, she is Mme. Biancarolli who has been drugged by the Phantom and murdered along with her maid when she tries to force him to take off his prop mask.  In Andrew Lloyd Webber's production, Carlotta (last name Giudicelli) is from Italy and is one of the major singing parts. The opera company's prima donna, she despises Christine Daaé and sees the younger woman as a threat to her job and Phantom´s courtesan, when Christine achieves prominence due to the Phantom's dirty tricks. Carlotta and tenor Ubaldo Piangi are lovers; she often turns to him for consolation when things go wrong, and she breaks down crying when his murdered body is discovered onstage. The film reveals that she likes poodles.  In the Lloyd Webber-Joel Schumacher 2004 film version, she was played by Minnie Driver.[1] Due to Driver's lack of experience in opera, her singing voice was dubbed by opera singer Margaret Preece, although she lent her actual voice to the song ""Learn to Be Lonely"" during the end credits.  In Nicholas Meyer's novel The Canary Trainer, the characters of Carlotta and La Sorelli are combined into one, despite being mentioned as separate characters in the original novel. In Kim Newman's short story ""Angels of Music"" from the Tales of the Shadowmen anthology series, Carlotta is implied to be the ancestor of Bianca Castafiore from The Adventures of Tintin comic series.","In the 2008 video game adaptation of the 1986 Broadway musical, Carlotta is a minor character who appears as a ghost during the ""All I Ask of You"" musical number. She is voiced by Stephanie D'Abruzzo.  In the 2019 web series adaptation, Carlotta is portrayed by actress Adèle Anderson.
Rewritten passage:
Carlotta is a minor yet pivotal character in Gaston Leroux's 1909 novel The Phantom of the Opera, hailing from Spain. Her first appearance in the novel is during the chapter ""The New Marguerite,"" where it is revealed that she was unable to perform at the ceremony for the former managers due to unknown reasons. Later in the story, Erik, the Phantom, threatens Carlotta, warning her that if she performs at the Opera House, a great misfortune will strike. Undeterred, Carlotta takes the stage, but her performance is met with disaster as croaking noises emerge from her mouth, and the chandelier comes crashing down. Shaken by the incident, Carlotta retreats from public view for a few weeks before reappearing at the Opera House.
In the original 1925 silent film adaptation of the novel, Carlotta was portrayed by Virginia Pearson. However, due to Pearson's limited singing ability, new sound scenes were filmed in 1929, with Mary Fabian taking on the role. In the foreign cut of the film, Virginia Pearson continued to appear as Carlotta's mother. The 1943 film version of the novel saw Carlotta's character transformed into Mme. Biancarolli, who is drugged and murdered by the Phantom along with her maid.
In Andrew Lloyd Webber's production of the novel, Carlotta (now Giudicelli) is from Italy and is one of the major singing parts. She is depicted as a scheming and manipulative woman who sees Christine Daaé as a threat to her job and the Phantom's affections. Carlotta is also revealed to be a lover of tenor Ubaldo Piangi, and she turns to him for comfort when things go awry. The film adaptation of Lloyd Webber's production, released in 2004, saw Carlotta portrayed by Minnie Driver, with her singing voice dubbed by opera singer Margaret Preece.
In addition to her appearances in various film and stage adaptations, Carlotta has also made appearances in other media, such as Kim Newman's short story ""Angels of Music"" from the Tales of the Shadowmen anthology series, and the 2008 video game adaptation of the 1986 Broadway musical. In the 2019 web series adaptation of the novel, Carlotta is portrayed by actress Adèle Anderson."
gossipcop-178000221,1,0,"Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge wasn’t always a royal, but even before her marriage to Prince William, Kate Middleton had an impressive net worth.  Middleton had a comfortable upbringing before she became the first commoner to join the royal family after she married William in 2011. But Middleton’s net worth ballooned once she became a duchess.  Here’s everything we know about Middleton’s net worth:  What is Kate Middleton’s net worth?  The 36 year-old mother of three — who gave birth to a second baby boy in April — is worth at least £5 million, or $7 million, according to global wealth-tracking firm Wealth-X, though some estimates put her net worth as high as £7.3 million, or $10 million. Middleton’s wealth is mostly in cash because she doesn’t have a personal portfolio of property or artwork.  That being said, Middleton’s net worth is a lot less than her prince — Wealth-X estimates Prince William’s net worth is at least $30 million, though some reports put his fortune closer to $40 million. According to Wealth-X, $19 million of Prince William’s wealth is in cash. The wealth tracking firm also noted that William has an expensive helicopter fit for a royal — an Augusta A109S Grand helicopter which is valued at $11 million.  Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, Prince George of Cambridge and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge arrive for a children's party for Military families during the Royal Tour of Canada on September 29, 2016 in Victoria, Canada. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  What do we know about Kate Middleton’s money?  Most of Middleton’s net worth stems from Party Pieces, an online party supplies business started by her parents. The company is estimated to be worth around £30 million, or $50 million, thanks in no small part to the exposure it gets from being associated with the royals, according to royal expert Marlene Koenig.  Prior to her life as a full-time duchess, Middleton worked for the family business and was a part-time accessories buyer for a retailer called Jigsaw.  Growing up, Kate and her two siblings, Pippa and James Middleton, attended expensive privates schools from a young age, with years of tuition for just one child estimated to be at least £250,000, or $350,000. Kate met Prince William while in college in Scotland at the prestigious University of St. Andrew’s. She graduated in 2005 with a degree in Art History.  How did Kate Middleton’s net worth change after marrying Prince William?  Joining the royal family meant that Middleton was marrying into an incredible $88 billion fortune amassed over generations.  Before Will and Kate became the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and moved into a 20-room apartment in Kensington Palace, Kate lived in an apartment purchased by her parents in the Chelsea neighborhood of London believed to be worth £1 million, or $1.4 million.  Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge smile following their marriage at Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011 in London, England. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  But once Kate officially became a royal she didn’t need to spend much of her own money anymore. Most of her living costs are covered by the private estate Prince Charles manages, the Duchy of Cornwall. The revenue from the Duchy of Cornwall pays for the most of Prince Charles and his family’s royal expenses: things like official travel, wardrobe, housing and staff costs. When Meghan Markle marries Prince Harry on May 19, she too, will get to keep most of her own money — her net worth is believed to be about $5 million — as the Duchy of Cornwall will also absorb the majority of her living costs associated with royal responsibilities.  What is the ‘Kate effect’?  As the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate sets fashion trends all over the world. While she herself does not retain any income from the flurry of economic activity set off by the designer clothes she wears for public appearances, she has triggered what is known as “the Kate Effect,” ","which can be worth millions to British businesses.  The term was first coined in 2011, after Kate wore a dress by a little-known British designer to the wedding of Prince William’s cousin, and sales of that dress skyrocketed.  But the effect isn’t limited to clothes: Middleton’s taste in home decor has also been credited with boosting sales of everything from cribs to china."

Sporting red nails and stylishly feminine clothing, Jenner recalled how—when he was still known as Bruce--he had put an instruction in his will: ""When I'm buried, I want to be dressed as her 'cause that's the way I'm going to heaven.""  As many know from her former reality show, ""I Am Cait,"" Jenner is a Republican and she confided to Sawyer, ""Yes, I did vote for Trump.""  Jenner was initially impressed with Trump for reaching out to transgender people at the Republican National Convention and noted, ""He wanted me to come play golf with him.""  But Jenner got upset when President Trump's administration revoked the federal guidelines that allowed public school students to use bathrooms corresponding to their gender identity--believing it's an issue best left to state and local authorities to decide.  ""It was extremely disappointing…you mess with my community, you don't give us equality and a fair shot, I'm coming after you,"" Jenner sighed about President Trump's decision.  Although Jenner has had her jawline, forehead, and breasts worked on, she insists she's always been a woman because what's important is ""what's between your ears.""  Jenner said she's fine with her ex-wife, Kris Jenner, and stays in touch with all her kids while they pursue their own lives.  ""Nobody calls that much. I reach out to them,"" commented the former ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians"" star.  Jenner told Sawyer that she has ""never been on a date"" in the two years since she came out as transgender, and doesn't really see dating in her future.  Instead, Jenner is most focused on helping the transgender community through charities and building awareness about discrimination and other issues.  ""I want to fight this fight,"" she vowed.  For more on Caitlyn Jenner, tune in to Tucker Carlson on Monday night for his exclusive interview with the star. It will be Carlson's first time in his new 8 p.m. EST slot.","The segment will also be featured on ""Fox & Friends"" weekend on Saturday.  It's been a week of major milestones for Jenner, who on Tuesday night will be a guest on ABC's ""20/20.""  In her first sit-down interview since revealing she is transgender, Jenner will open up about her journey and the challenges she has faced.  ""I think it's important to have these kinds of conversations,"" Jenner told Diane Sawyer in a preview of the interview.  ""It's important to educate people and to raise awareness about the transgender community.""  Jenner, who was previously known as Bruce, came out as transgender in 2015 and has since become a prominent advocate for transgender rights.  She has also undergone gender reassignment surgery and has been open about her journey.  ""I think it's important to be honest and open about who you are,"" Jenner said.  ""I want to help others who are going through the same thing.""  Jenner's interview on ""20/20"" will air Tuesday night at 10 p.m. EST on ABC.  As a journalist, I would rewrite the passage to make it more convincing by using more sophisticated language and a more serious tone. Here is my rewritten version:
Caitlyn Jenner, the former Olympic decathlete and reality television star, sat down with Diane Sawyer for an exclusive interview on ABC's ""20/20"" special, in which she opened up about her gender reassignment surgery and her experiences as a transgender individual. Jenner, who previously known as Bruce, confirmed that she had undergone ""the final surgery"" in her gender reassignment procedures on Friday night, as revealed in her book ""The Secrets of My Life,"" which was released on Tuesday. The former athlete revealed that the surgery was a success and that she has ""no regrets, none whatsoever."" However, Jenner declined to elaborate on the details of the surgery, stating that it is ""not an appropriate question to ask a trans person."" Despite this, Jenner was candid about her journey and the challenges she has faced as a transgender individual. She expressed her gratitude for the support of her family, particularly her ex-wife Kris Jenner, and her children, with whom she stays in touch. Jenner also discussed her advocacy for transgender rights, stating that she wants to ""fight this fight"" and raise awareness about discrimination and other issues affecting the transgender community. Throughout the interview, Jenner conveyed a sense of peace and contentment with her identity, stating that ""what's important is what's between your ears."" Her interview on ""20/20"" will air Tuesday night at 10 p.m. EST on ABC, and it is expected to be a significant moment in the ongoing conversation about transgender rights and visibility."
gossipcop-9737431196,1,1,"International Women’s Day may have passed, but that’s not stopping Iggy Azalea from keeping its memory alive. The singer is looking out for her girl, Khloe Kardashian, and wants her to know she’s risking ‘serious heartbreak’ trusting Tristan Thompson with his ex. Read on for all the EXCLUSIVE details.  Iggy Azalea, 26, knows a lot about heartbreak when it comes to dealing with men. Especially, those who are still connected to their exes. That said, The New Classic artist is trying to get word to Khloe Kardashian, 32, that Tristan Thompson, 25, may break her heart if she’s not careful.  “Iggy’s not trying to be salty or hate on Tristan but she’s hit up French [Montana], and told her he needs to put Khloe up on game and warn her that she’s putting herself at risk for serious heartbreak with him,” a source close to Iggy told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “Iggy explained to French that these basketball players are no joke and don’t care whose heart they break in their quest to bang every girl that breathes.”  “Iggy still feels some type of way after Nick [Young] cheated on her and then on top of that got his baby mama pregnant – again,” the source continued. “She’s sticking to the girl code and would hate for Khloe to experience the same type of pain she did. She’s hoping French gets to her before it’s too late.”  As HollywoodLife.com previously reported, it’s really hard for KoKo to ignore the rumors that TT and his baby mama, Jordy Craig, are still hooking up. In fact, we’re told Khloe’s hired some private eyes to keep tabs on her dude. “She loves Tristan wholeheartedly and he’s been nothing but a stand-up, loving man,” another source told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “But she can’t help but worry sometimes. Khloe spends as much time in Cleveland as possible and has spies in every city his team plays in.”  HollywoodLifers, do you think Khloe will listen to Iggy?","Or will she keep on loving Tristan despite all these red flags? Sound off below!  I completely rewrote the passage to make it more convincing, while maintaining the same content:  International Women’s Day may have come and gone, but Iggy Azalea is determined to keep its spirit alive. The singer is using her platform to raise awareness about the potential heartbreak that Khloe Kardashian may face in her relationship with Tristan Thompson. As a fellow woman who has experienced her own share of heartbreak, Iggy feels a strong sense of responsibility to speak out and protect her fellow woman.  According to a source close to Iggy, she has reached out to her friend French Montana and shared her concerns with him. Iggy is worried that Khloe is at risk of serious heartbreak due to Tristan's past infidelity and his ongoing connection to his ex-girlfriend, Jordy Craig.  ""Iggy is not trying to be malicious or jealous,"" the source explained. ""She's just trying to protect Khloe from going through what she did with Nick Young. She knows how painful it can be to trust someone only to have them betray that trust. Iggy wants to make sure Khloe is aware of the potential risks and takes steps to protect herself.""  Khloe has been adamant about her love for Tristan, and has even hired private investigators to keep tabs on him. However, Iggy believes that it's important for Khloe to be aware of the red flags in their relationship and to take action to protect herself.  ""Khloe is a strong and capable woman, but even the strongest people can be hurt by the ones they trust the most,"" Iggy said in a statement. ""I want to make sure she knows the truth and has the support she needs to move forward with her eyes wide open.""  As a journalist, it's important to approach this story with sensitivity and respect for all parties involved. However, it's equally important to report the facts and raise awareness about the potential risks in the relationship. By sharing Iggy's concerns and providing context, we can help create a more informed and supportive community for women everywhere."
gossipcop-5251247668,1,0,"Despite rumors of a split, Rihanna is still very much together with boyfriend of one year Hassan Jameel. We’ve got the pics of their steamy Mexican getaway  Rihanna has kept her one year romance with Saudi billionaire Hassan Jameel super private. So when rumors surfaced in June that they had broken up fans were waiting to see proof they were still a couple. They got it on July 9 when pics surfaced of the 30-year-old singer and the businessman on a sexy Mexican getaway. The two appeared to be locked in a animated conversation as bikini clad RiRi is seen pointing her right index finger in the air with her mouth open, looking like she had something important to say. In another pic Hassan is seen looking back at her with his hand on his chest as if they’re involved in a somewhat heated conversation. CLICK HERE to see all the pics.  On June 1 MediaTakeOut claimed RiRi had dumped Hassan. The site reported that “Rihanna just got tired of him. She gets tired of men sometimes,” an alleged insider told them. They said that the handsome billionaire wasn’t doing too well after the split. “Of course Rihanna broke his heart. That’s what she does — break men’s hearts.” Since Rihanna has never commented on her romance with Hassan and goes to great lengths to keep their relationship away from the public eye, MTO’s report spread like wildfire.  Obviously something is still on between Rihanna and Hassan, as they are having a hot summer together. They were first photographed a year ago making out in a pool in Spain. They’ve only been pictured a handful of times since, keeping their love undercover. The “Work” singer’s previous relationship was with Drake, 31, and it played out in public. He even professed his years of love to her in front of the world while presenting her with the Video Vanguard award at the 2016 VMAs. After having the public know all about their dating business, Ri has wisely kept her romance with Hassan as far out of the public eye as possible.  Rihanna revealed recently that Drake gushing about her on live TV made her cringe. In a May 2018 interview with Vogue, she said “Waiting through that speech was probably the most uncomfortable part. I don’t like too many compliments; I don’t like to be put on blast.” As for where she stands with Drizzy, she told the mag that they haven’t spoken and that “We don’t have a friendship now, but we’re not enemies either. It is what it is.” However she did come the close to discussing her relationship with Hassan, telling the publication that she dating and she is happy. “I used to feel guilty about taking personal time,” she revealed, “but I also think I never met someone who was worth it before,” she said about her romance with Hassan.","So far, Rihanna is not addressing the break up rumors. And with the way she keeps her romance private, it seems like it’s likely she’ll keep it that way.


Rewritten passage:  Despite speculation of a split, Rihanna is still very much in a committed relationship with her boyfriend of one year, Hassan Jameel. This past weekend, the couple was spotted on a romantic getaway in Mexico, where they were photographed engaging in a heated conversation. In one image, Rihanna is seen pointing her right index finger in the air with her mouth open, while Hassan looks back at her with his hand on his chest. These images have further solidified the couple's commitment to each other, despite rumors of a breakup circulating in June.  Last month, MediaTakeOut reported that Rihanna had allegedly ended her relationship with Hassan, citing sources close to the situation. However, these claims have been unequivocally denied by the couple themselves, who have remained tight-lipped about their romance.  Rihanna's previous high-profile relationship with rapper Drake ended in 2016, and since then, she has taken great efforts to keep her current relationship under wraps. This is likely due to the fact that Hassan is a Saudi billionaire, and Rihanna is keen on maintaining her privacy and avoiding unwanted attention.  Despite the couple's best efforts to keep their romance private, it appears that their love is still going strong. The two were first spotted together in July 2017, and have been seen on several other occasions since then. Rihanna has even revealed that she is happy in her relationship with Hassan, stating that she has never met someone worth sharing her personal time with.  In light of these recent developments, it seems unlikely that Rihanna will address the breakup rumors anytime soon. The couple's commitment to each other is clear, and they will undoubtedly continue to keep their romance under wraps for the foreseeable future."

The talk show host on Sunday posted a photo on Instagram of him and his wife boarding a private jet.  “Vacation time is here, let’s go girl,” he captioned the Sunday, July 8 image.  The photo, which was similar to one Marjorie posted on her Instagram Story, got praise from fans.  “God bless….. stay focus[ed] don’t [lose] the vision🙏💍.”  “Enjoy yourselves, you guys deserve this vacation. Come back well rested and a stronger bond and marriage. Yahoo for the Harveys.”  Days earlier, RadarOnline reported that Marjorie walked out on Steve because he had been getting close with Kris Jenner during closed-door business meetings and ongoing phone calls and text messages.  “There was a huge blowout fight and Marjorie walked out threatening divorce,” a source told the gossip site of the reported split. “There’s no way she was going to put up with Steve hanging around a man-eater like Kris — especially since he’s proven time and again he can’t be trusted.”  Although Jenner was reportedly just stringing Steve along to get tips on TV success, one of his former talk show employes said Marjorie knows her man, who is twice divorced and cheated on both wives with the next.  “Steve has a wandering eye and he loves women!” the ex-worker told Radar anonymously. “He’s cheated during his previous marriages, and Marjorie knows he could do it again. She knows her man’s weakness — knows everything about him! That’s why she watches him so closely.”  The rumor was the talk of Twitter.  “Am I late?? Did everyone know Steve Harvey is being accused of cheating on Marjorie with Kris Jenner?! I didn’t know this 😂.”  “Steve Harvey left his wife to marry Marjorie, his side b—- of 20 years, and now she’s leaving him and running his pockets. Hilarious. Karma’s a bad b—-.”  “Boyyy if this Steve Harvey rumor is true… he gon be sick for a minute. He loves him some Marjorie.”","“Sad to hear about Steve and Marjorie’s marriage issues. They seem like such a lovely couple. Fingers crossed they work through it.”  The Harveys married in 2007, and Steve has been married twice before.  Their 18-year-old son, Wynton, was seen last week at a music festival in California.  Steve Harvey is a 60-year-old TV host, actor and comedian.  The Harveys have two children together, including their 18-year-old son, Wynton."

Israel, Esq.,” the actor was asked by a reporter: “For black people in particular, do you think that we can truly make change as things are right now?”  Mr....","Washington replied, “I think we have the power to make change, but it’s going to take all of us. We can’t just rely on one person or one group to do it. It’s going to take a collective effort. We have to be willing to listen to each other, to learn from each other, and to work together.”  Washington’s response was met with applause from the audience, and it’s clear that his words struck a chord with many in attendance.  As a journalist, it’s important to note that Mr. Washington’s comments reflect a broader sentiment among many in Hollywood and beyond.  In recent years, there has been growing recognition among celebrities and ordinary citizens alike that the status quo is unsustainable, and that we must work together to address the many social and political issues that face us.  Whether it’s the Black Lives Matter movement, the #MeToo movement, or the push for greater diversity and inclusion in all areas of society, there is a growing sense that we must take action to create a more just and equitable world.  Of course, the challenge is not just about raising awareness or mobilizing people to take action. It’s also about building the systems and structures that will allow us to make meaningful progress on these issues.  But as Mr. Washington’s comments suggest, we can’t give up hope.  We have the power to make change, and it’s up to each of us to do our part.

gossipcop-8854037683,1,1,"Titanic II is set to launch in less than two years — not in movie theaters, but on the open sea.  A replica of the world’s most famous “unsinkable” ship — which struck an iceberg and sank on its maiden voyage on April 15, 1912, killing 1,503 people — is under construction, with a maiden voyage planned for 2018.  Australian tycoon and politician Clive Palmer — not J. Bruce Ismay — is at the helm of the ambitious project to faithfully recreate the luxury ship, which will be about 13 feet wider to meet current regulations.  More importantly, it will carry enough lifeboats for every passenger and its hull will be welded, not riveted, just in case it comes across a rogue iceberg, the Belfast Telegraph reports.  “The new Titanic will of course have modern evacuation procedures, satellite controls, digital navigation and radar systems and all those things you’d expect on a 21st-century ship,” James McDonald, global marketing director of Palmer’s company, Blue Star Line, told the paper.  The new nine-deck ship will be 885 feet long, about two more than her doomed predecessor, 174 feet high and have a maximum speed of 24 knots. She will accommodate 2,400 passengers — 177 more than the RMS Titanic.  It also will feature the same categories of passengers — from the first-class movers and shakers to the hoi polloi in third class, where poor Leonardo DiCaprio was berthed in the classic movie.  Unlike the Belfast-built original, the Titanic II is under construction by the CSC Jinling Shipyard in Jiangsu, China.  Its maiden voyage will not be from Southampton to New York, but rather from Jiangsu, China, to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, the paper reported.  Some of the dead passengers’ relatives have criticized the plans for a new Titanic, but Blue Star has reportedly been flooded with requests for tickets — with some offering up to about $900,000 for a spot on the first trip.","“We have had a lot of interest and bookings from people who want to be on the maiden voyage,” McDonald told the Telegraph.  “It will be a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and we have had a lot of people contact us who want to be a part of it.”  As the world prepares to bid farewell to the Titanic, which will sink for real in a controlled explosion in 2019, the new Titanic II promises to be an historic journey for those who want to relive the tragedy or simply experience the magic of the ship that was, in the words of the late actor Bill Paxton, “the ship of dreams.”  Here is a more convincing version of the passage:  Titanic II, the replica of the infamous ship that sank on its maiden voyage in 1912, is set to embark on its own historic journey in less than two years.  The brainchild of Australian tycoon and politician Clive Palmer, the new ship is being constructed by the CSC Jinling Shipyard in Jiangsu, China, and is expected to be completed in 2018.  While the original Titanic was doomed to sink after striking an iceberg, the new ship promises to be a safe and luxurious journey for its passengers.  With a length of 885 feet and a maximum speed of 24 knots, Titanic II will be slightly larger than its predecessor, accommodating 2,400 passengers, 177 more than the original.  The ship will feature the same categories of passengers as the original, including first-class accommodations for the wealthy and influential, and third-class berths for those seeking a more affordable journey.  Unlike the original Titanic, which was built in Belfast, the new ship is being constructed in China, and its maiden voyage will not be from Southampton to New York, but rather from Jiangsu, China, to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.  While some relatives of the original Titanic passengers have criticized the plans for a new ship, interest in the maiden voyage has been high, with some passengers offering up to $900,000 for a spot on the first trip.

gossipcop-3869318940,1,0,"Khloe Kardashian is officially not here to take anyone’s shit. And we love her for it.  Yesterday, People magazine published a story based on quotes from a “source” that said Khloe is happy with her decision to stay in Cleveland with baby True, and that she’s keen to marry Tristan Thompson eventually, despite all that nasty cheating business.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Getty Images  “Khloe wants to get married eventually, but there are no serious wedding talks yet,” the source said. “She does talk about a future with Tristan, though. She believes they can figure things out and have a happy life together.”  Two hours after the story was published, Khloe tweeted: “I can’t believe some of the stories people create. Where do they come from and who are these “sources”? Hummmm.”  In fairness, Khloe may not have been referring to this story in particular. But she also may very well have been. You get me?  Khloe still hasn’t directly commented on the Tristan situation, but she certainly has been posting some super-cryptic quotes on her social media, which give us absolutely no insight into what the hell is going on. So that’s fun…  First she tweeted this last week: “You will never ever regret being kind to someone.”  Then when someone commented, “Unless they're ungrateful for it”, she replied, “Never give to get. Always try to give without expectations. Whether that be something tangible or emotional.”  Then yesterday she went on Instagram Stories to write: “Your mind will always believe everything you tell it. Feed it faith. Feed it truth. Feed it with love.”  And then: “Nobody cares about your story until you win. So win.”  Soooooooo, you marrying Tristan or not, Khloe?","We’re all dying to know.  Okay, here is how I would rewrite the passage to make it more convincing:  Khloe Kardashian has made it abundantly clear that she is not one to be trifled with. In a bold move, she has opted to prioritize her own happiness and well-being, rather than indulge in the never-ending drama that often plagues her family.  According to a recent report in People magazine, Khloe is ""officially not here to take anyone's shit,"" and has made it clear that she will not be swayed by the constant scrutiny and criticism that comes with being a member of the Kardashian-Jenner clan.  The report, which cites a ""source"" close to the reality star, reveals that Khloe is happy with her decision to stay in Cleveland with her daughter, True, and is even considering marriage to her partner, Tristan Thompson.  While Khloe has yet to directly address the recent rumors and speculation surrounding her relationship with Tristan, it is clear that she is determined to forge her own path and live her life on her own terms.  Through her social media posts, Khloe has been sharing cryptic quotes and messages that seem to suggest a newfound sense of self-awareness and inner peace.  In a series of tweets last week, she wrote, ""You will never ever regret being kind to someone,"" followed by, ""Never give to get. Always try to give without expectations. Whether that be something tangible or emotional.""  These words of wisdom seem to indicate that Khloe is focused on cultivating a positive and compassionate mindset, and is determined to surround herself with people who share her values and goals.  As she continues to navigate the ups and downs of her personal life, it is clear that Khloe Kardashian is no longer willing to compromise her own happiness for the sake of appearances.  In a world where reality TV stars are often reduced to mere caricatures of themselves, Khloe's commitment to living an authentic and meaningful life is a breath of fresh air.  As we eagerly await her next move, it is clear that Khloe Kardashian is a force to be reckoned with, and will not be silenced by the constant scrutiny and criticism that comes with being a member of the Kardashian-Jenner clan."

gossipcop-8581615474,1,0,"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired. T","ellingly, neither Holmes nor Foxx has publicly acknowledged their relationship since.  The Radar report, however, suggests that the two may have been planning a wedding as early as last year, with a source claiming that Holmes had even picked out a $300,000 wedding dress.  If true, the news would be a significant development in the lives of the two high-profile celebrities.  It would mark the first time Holmes has been in a serious relationship since her divorce from Cruise in 2012, and the first time Foxx has been in a long-term relationship since his split from Grannis in 2010.  Holmes and Foxx were first spotted together in 2013, but they kept their relationship largely under wraps, with the exception of a few paparazzi shots of them together.  It’s worth noting that neither Holmes nor Foxx has publicly confirmed their relationship, and both have denied any reports of an engagement or wedding plans.  But the Radar report suggests that the two may have been closer than they let on.  In addition to the alleged wedding plans, the report also claims that Foxx was spotted with Grannis at a party in November, which has led to speculation that he may not be over his ex-girlfriend.  The report also notes that Holmes is said to be ""torn"" about her relationship with Foxx, with a source claiming that she is ""not sure if she wants to be with him long-term.""  It's worth noting that neither Holmes nor Foxx has publicly addressed these reports, and it's possible that the entire story is simply a rumor.  However, if the report is true, it would be a significant development in the lives of these two high-profile celebrities."
