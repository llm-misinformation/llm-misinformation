Dancing With the Stars will return for its 22nd season with Len Goodman back where he belongs, Bindi Irwin as the reigning champ, and a baby boy or girl for Allison Holker. There's much to look forward to, but not before we close out this season one last time with everything that happened after the finale! (In case you missed it, you can read our recap of the best and worst moments here .) Almost an hour after Tom Bergeron declared Bindi Irwin and Derek Hough the winners of season 21, Bindi was still in disbelief, shouting from the top of her lungs, ""I think I'm going to scream for 20 minutes!"" Her exuberance and genuine nature endeared her to literally every one on set, but no one more so than Derek. ""It's just so special with Bindi,"" he told reporters backstage. ""She's a champion of life."" Bindi shared the same sentiment, telling those in the ballroom that she gained another brother in Derek. In case you needed further proof that the two are friends for life, consider this: Derek's hopping on a plane to Australia in a couple weeks ""to tackle crocodiles and get my official khakis!"" The Houghster may have nabbed his sixth Mirrorball trophy, but it was his partnership with Bindi that undoubtedly made it his favorite season. ""There's not a thing I would change about this season,"" he told Glamour post-show. ""There's not a week I would change, a dance I would change, and that was a very calming, very peaceful feeling. The show is a completely different show than the first time I won, and to win at this level and the standard that this show has been raised to, it's been incredible."" While Bindi and Derek make the press rounds in New York City, it's no secret that she's itching to get back to her hometown down under. ""I can't wait to get back to all the animals, continue all the conservation work, and carry on in my dad's footsteps."" Season 21 runner-ups Sharna Burgess and Nick Carter were understandably disappointed not to win the big prize, but they both praised Bindi and Derek for their phenomenal journey this season. ""Bindi was the whole package,"" praised the red-haired stunner. ""She and Derek had a beautiful partnership."" Still, ""it's bittersweet in may ways. Did I really want this to be my first Mirrorball? Absolutely. I would be lying if I said I didn't. But Bindi was undeniable this entire season. She grew so much, and she's just such a beautiful person you can't help but be captivated by her. Both [she and Nick] are winners, and I truly believe that."" Echoed Nick: ""It was just such a pleasure to be here. I didn't expect to get anything, so anytime something great happened in the competition, it was a pleasant surprise to me."" So what's up next for Nick? Well, aside from getting ready for Baby Boy Carter , his solo album ( All American ) drops today, and he has a movie coming out next year that he wrote and directed. As for third-place contestant, Alek Skarlatos , he'll be heading on the DWTS Tour this winter, but his immediate plans are much simpler: ""I can't wait to get on the plane tonight to eat. A lot."" But what about his dating life? Any updates on that? ""It's been pretty crazy, honestly. [I haven't had time] for many dates lately."" Added Lindsay: ""I'll be his wing woman on tour!"" During all the hectic action backstage, Allison Holker was a ball of energy, especially for someone six month's pregnant. ""I feel incredible!"" gushed the pro. ""Dancing around with a baby that's the size of a football in your belly is never an easy task, but it's been amazing. Although I never expected to see myself in a sparkly costume on the Dancing With the Stars stage six months pregnant!"" Allison (and husband tWitch) will find out the baby's gender on December 10, ""which is our anniversary too."" In case you're wondering, she'll reveal whether it's a boy or a girl on social media shortly thereafter!

Dancing With the Stars is coming back for its 22nd season, featuring the return of Len Goodman, Bindi Irwin as the reigning champion, and the exciting news of a baby for Allison Holker. Before we get to the new season, let's take a look back at everything that happened after the finale. After being declared the winners of season 21, Bindi Irwin and Derek Hough were still in shock, with Bindi exclaiming, ""I think I'm going to scream for 20 minutes!"". Their friendship and partnership was evident throughout the season, with Derek even considering Bindi as a sister. In fact, he's planning a trip to Australia to experience her world. Although he has won the Mirrorball trophy six times, Derek said this was his favorite season and wouldn't change a thing. Bindi is eager to return to her wildlife conservation work in Australia. While Sharna Burgess and Nick Carter were disappointed not to win, they praised Bindi and Derek for their amazing journey. Nick has his solo album and a movie coming up, while Sharna plans to be Nick's wing woman on tour. Alek Skarlatos is looking forward to the DWTS Tour and his simple pleasure of eating. Allison Holker, despite being six months pregnant, was full of energy and happy to be dancing on the show. She's preparing for her first Thanksgiving and the arrival of her baby, which she'll reveal the gender of on social media. The return of Len Goodman as a judge next season was a big announcement backstage, and the pros were excited to have him back. Mark Ballas hopes to have his girlfriend compete on the show, although he joked that she might be assigned to Derek instead. Overall, it was a night filled with amazing performances and heartfelt moments."

The son of an Army major, Strahan grew up in Germany and did not play competitive high school football until his senior year when his parents sent him to live with his aunt and uncle in Texas.  The former defensive end played well enough to earn a scholarship to Texas Southern University. By his senior year of college, he had set a record for sacks, which got the attention of the NFL.  In 1993, the New York Giants drafted Strahan as the 40th overall draft pick. Over the next 14 seasons, he became the league’s all-time quarterback sack leader, played in the Pro Bowl and helped the Giants defeat the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLII.  Upon retiring in 2008, Strahan concentrated on his off-field talents. In 2012, he became Kelly Ripa’s “Live! With Kelly” co-host, replacing longtime host Regis Philbin. Four years later, he left the show and joined ABC’s “Good Morning America”; it took more than a year for “Live” to announce Ryan Seacrest as its new co-host.  Strahan also serves as a Fox NFL Sunday analyst during the football season.  As of May 2017, Strahan’s net worth was $65 million, with a salary of $17 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.

gossipcop-7392274516,1,0,"They both looked so happy, and so relaxed. They were beaming as they said their vows, and luckily, no one came forward to provide any reason that they might not be married. (This is always an exciting moment in a ceremony.) It was an extraordinary mix of tradition and modernity, of centuries of history and up-to-the moment flourishes. Oprah was here, and so was Meghan’s mother, an African-American social worker who wore a conventional mother-of-the-bride outfit and also a nose stud. It somehow looked charming and just right. The entire royal family was here, along with a complement of English aristocrats and important personages. The music was stately and beautiful. The setting was awe-inspiring. There was a flotilla of clergymen, an extraordinary mélange including the archbishop of Canterbury and — in a striking inclusion in this most ancient of places — the head of the Episcopal Church, the Most Rev. Michael Curry. Chosen to give the address to the congregations, Bishop Curry, who is African-American, quoted Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. His voice rising and falling with emotion, he made a big, generous, impassioned case for love as the most important thing there is, in religion and in life. His address came after a reading by Lady Jane Fellowes, Harry’s aunt (her sister was Diana, Princess of Wales) that was both full of joy and a signal, it seemed, that the sadness in Harry’s life since his mother’s death had finally lifted. It was a passage from the Song of Solomon: “Arise my love, my fair one, and come away; for now the winter is past, the rain is over and gone.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story The dress was a success: sculptural simplicity. Photo Our fashion critic, Vanessa Friedman, is also watching, and she has a quick take for us on Meghan Markle’s dress. It was absolutely simple: pure and sculptural, in double bonded silk cady with a wide boatneck, long sleeves and sweeping train. It was Meghan Markle’s wedding dress. It was by Clare Waight Keller, a British woman and the first female designer of Givenchy. And it was everything people had hoped. This was not a Cinderella choice, not one that spoke of fantasy or old-fashioned fairy tales. Instead, it placed the woman proudly front and center and underscored Ms. Markle’s own independence. At the same time, it celebrated female strength, promoted a local designer and reached a hand across to Europe (where Ms. Waight Keller has a day job). The five-meter veil was of silk tulle, with a trim of hand-embroidered flowers in silk threads and organza, and contained embroidery representing the flora of all 53 Commonwealth nations. Video And it was entirely a surprise. In all the rumors that had swirled around The Dress, from Ralph & Russo to Stella McCartney, Ms. Waight Keller’s name had never come up. In the end, Ms. Markle outthought us all. As this starts, long may it continue. And the After-Party Dress The newly minted Duke and Duchess of Sussex departed Windsor for their evening reception at Frogmore House in a very James Bond fashion. The duchess wore a second dress by designer Stella McCartney. You can read our fashion critic Vanessa Friedman’s reaction here. Advertisement Continue reading the main story A good time was had by all (even before the cocktails). Photo Unlike a lot of weddings — and certainly unlike Kate and William’s wedding, just seven years ago — the guests inside hung out in the aisles, air-kissing and gossiping. It’s a great royal-and-celebrity cocktail party! (Sadly without cocktails.) Kate and William’s wedding was solemn, stately, stuffy, full of dignitaries, politicians, and the sort of boring personages known here as the great and the good. But this looked totally fun for the guests — even more fun than, say, the Academy Awards — because no one was competing for anything and no one was forced to talk about their outfits to television reporters. Part of the change in tone is down to the passage of time and to how much Britain, or perhaps","Both of them had a joyful and relaxed demeanor as they exchanged their vows. Fortunately, no one raised any objections to their marriage, an exhilarating moment during the ceremony. The event combined elements of tradition and modernity, blending centuries of history with contemporary touches. A notable presence was Oprah, as well as Meghan's African-American mother, who donned a conventional mother-of-the-bride ensemble alongside a nose stud, which surprisingly complemented her look. The royal family, English aristocrats, and important figures were all in attendance. The music was grand and beautiful, and the setting was awe-inspiring. The clergy members included a diverse mix, such as the archbishop of Canterbury and the head of the Episcopal Church, the Most Rev. Michael Curry.

The wedding dress received high praise for its elegant simplicity, crafted from double bonded silk cady with a boatneck, long sleeves, and a sweeping train. Designed by Clare Waight Keller, the first female designer of Givenchy, the dress showcased Meghan's independence and celebrated female strength, while also promoting a local designer and bridging connections to Europe. The veil, five meters long, featured hand-embroidered flowers representing the various Commonwealth nations. The choice of Clare Waight Keller as the designer came as a surprise, as her name had not been associated with the rumors surrounding the dress. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex later departed for their evening reception at Frogmore House, with Meghan wearing a second dress by Stella McCartney. The guests at the wedding appeared to be thoroughly enjoying themselves, creating an atmosphere similar to a star-studded cocktail party, free from the pressures of competition and excessive media attention. The change in tone can be attributed to both the evolving nature of Britain and the royal family, as well as Harry's position as the second son, allowing him more freedom to deviate from tradition. This wedding was not centered around royal lineage or securing the future of the monarchy but was instead focused on the love and celebration shared between two individuals. The guest list, initially kept secret, unveiled several notable figures, including Oprah Winfrey, whose presence symbolized her status as an American icon transcending race and background. Kate Middleton's parents, Charles Spencer (Diana's brother), and celebrity couples George and Amal Clooney, and David and Victoria Beckham were also in attendance, further adding to the star-studded atmosphere."

She’s Had Relationships With Several Male Celebrities Lovato, like most notable celebrities, have dated other people in the industry. According to Pop Sugar, she dated The Cab frontman Alex DeLeon from 2008-09, and later based the breakup song “Catch Me” on him. Lovato also had brief flings with Trace Cyrus (Miley’s older brother) in 2009 and Joe Jonas, her self-proclaimed “BFF,” in 2010. Her most notable relationship to date, however, has been with Valderrama, whom she dated from from 2010 to 2016. In an interview with Latina magazine, Lovato discussed what attracted her to the That 70’s Show actor: When I dated white guys, it wasn’t as passionate as my relationship with Wilmer. Maybe that’s just Wilmer. But I do believe that Latin people are just more expressive, more passionate with their emotions. He’s very manly, and he can be stubborn like Latino men can, but he’s protective and he cares so much and loves so hard. I’ve been blessed enough to have him in my life, and not just as my man, but also my best friend. Since her breakup from Valderrama, Lovato’s been seen with MMA fighter Guilherme “Bomba” Vasconcelos and Abedini. 3.

This year, however really, really feels like it. This year has been a barrage of bizarre and bummer headlines that at times it's felt like some dystopian nightmare.  It's been so bad that the Kardashian-West clan have just decided to end 2016 early. Yes, Kim and Kanye have decided to cancel all public and professional commitments for the end of the year and plan to maintain their social media blackouts as well. To be exact, a flack told Page Six that Kim and Kanye “plan on taking the rest of 2016 off and spending time as a family.""  Which, frankly, we wish we all could do, don't we?  Is it possible for President Obama's last major act to be an executive decree for us to just all get a chance to chill out and recuperate for the remaining 26 days left in this bummer of a year? Sure, there's no political safeguarding against any potential additional music legends from dying or preventing any further tragedies and disasters from happening or ensuring that some new odd Zika-like disease pops up, but there's got to be something? How about the ""Netflix and Chill Act?"" Just an order that all Americans get to spend the next month relaxing and catching up on any television series they may have missed this year.  Of course, when it comes to Kim and Kanye it's understandable that they've decided to literally cancel the rest of their 2016. Kim was still in the midst of recuperating from being robbed at gunpoint in Paris when her husband Kanye was hospitalized following a very public breakdown.  They've had to endure these private tragedies while also dealing with immense public interest and rumors running rampant in the tabloid press.  E!, the home of the Kardashian's reality TV empire, reports that a family source says ""Kim is doing okay despite reports.""  ""She has many things on her plate so being overwhelmed is expected,"" the source continued. ""She wants to get Kanye back on his feet. She is not leaving him. She loves him.""  Kanye was released from an L.A.-area hospital last week after spending more than a week receiving treatment for exhaustion. Kim West was reportedly by his side throughout the entire ordeal and now wants to make sure Kanye continues to receive therapy and treatment now that he's out of the hospital.  Despite your personal opinion on the pair, it certainly does seem like the family deserves the rest. In addition to their dual ordeal, they also have two young children to care for after all (in fact, today is Saint West's first birthday). Maybe it's best we all let them lay low and chill for the next month or so.  Unfortunately, we all don't have the luxury as much as we wish we could. Then again, it's not looking like 2017 is shaping up to be any better. Hopefully, a rested and healthier Kim and Kanye can get back into form and provide us with the not-quite-as-tragic-as-this distractions we'll probably desperately need in the new year.  Update: Kanye, for one, has now reappeared in public, albeit in a very low-key way. He was spotted with newly blond hair at designer Rick Owens' furniture show in Los Angeles .","As December approaches, it has become somewhat of a tradition for people to complain about how the past year has been the worst ever.

The Kardashian-West family has decided to end their year early due to the overwhelming circumstances. Kim and Kanye have chosen to cancel all their public appearances and maintain a blackout on social media. They plan to spend the rest of 2016 focusing on their family. It is something we all wish we could do, isn't it? Perhaps President Obama's final major act could be an executive decree allowing everyone to relax and recuperate for the remaining days of this terrible year. This may not prevent any more unfortunate events from happening, but maybe we could have a ""Netflix and Chill Act"" where Americans are given the opportunity to catch up on missed television shows. In the case of Kim and Kanye, it is understandable that they have decided to cancel the rest of their year. Kim is still recovering from the traumatic armed robbery she experienced in Paris, while Kanye was recently hospitalized after a public breakdown. They have had to face these personal tragedies while dealing with intense public scrutiny and rumors in the tabloids. Despite these challenges, Kim is reportedly doing okay and wants to support Kanye in his recovery. He was released from the hospital last week and she wants to ensure he continues to receive therapy and treatment. The family deserves some rest, especially considering they have two young children to care for. Unfortunately, the rest of us do not have the luxury to take time off. Furthermore, it does not appear that 2017 will bring any relief. Hopefully, a refreshed Kim and Kanye can provide us with some distractions in the new year that are not as tragic as the ones we have experienced.

Now a leaked Cannibal Club document has exposed some of the notorious restaurant’s “elite” patrons.  CANNIBALISM ‘MORE POPULAR THAN YOU MIGHT THINK’  Meryl Streep, Chelsea Clinton and CNN’s Anderson Cooper all hold Cannibal Club membership, according to the document. Katy Perry, who has previously said that “Cannibalism is way more popular than you might think” and “human flesh is the best meat“, is also a regular diner.  Boasting that the restaurant is the “cutting edge of experimental cuisine” and serves “L.A.’s cultural elite“, the Cannibal Club website makes clear they “specialize in the preparation of human meat” that comes from “young and healthy bodies.“  Cannibal Club’s visiting chefs “hail from around the world” and come to L.A. to “practice their craft free of compromise and unbounded by convention,” according to the Cannibal Club website.  ‘FILMMAKERS, INTELLECTUALS, AND CELEBRITIES’  “Our exclusive clientele includes noted filmmakers, intellectuals, and celebrities who have embraced the Enlightenment ideals of free expression and rationalism. On event nights, avant-garde performance artists, celebrated literary figures, and ground-breaking musicians entertain our guests.  “At Cannibal Club, we celebrate artistic excellence as the natural and inevitable expression of the unbridled human spirit.“  Describing each dish as a “study in taste and elegance“, Chef de Cuisine Sophie Laffite explains: “The meat we serve is selected from the young and healthy. Consistent with the practice of cannibalism in many primitive societies, we view anthropophagy as homage to the dead, who are reborn into the bodies of their consumers.”  But don’t think you can just walk in there and check the place out. The private restaurant operates a strict vetting policy, according to the website:  “It is necessary for us to operate privately and to vette our members in order to avoid disruption from the less enlightened.“  HUMAN MEAT MENU  The current menu listed on the site includes Sirloin Steak (human meat, flame-broiled 8oz), Liver and Mushroom Pirozhi (“a Russian version of pierogies, baked rather than boiled, with a savory filling of wild mushrooms and human liver“) and Placenta Lasagne (“an otherwise traditional lasagna with one layer of cheese substituted by minced placenta in heirloom tomato sauce, seasoned with garlic, onion and oregano”.)  Elspeth Blake, the Cannibal Club proprietor who claims to have earned her stripes working under Vincent Sardi Jr. in New York, did not immediately respond to our questions regarding where the human flesh comes from.  ‘YOUNG AND HEALTHY BODIES’  In the FAQ section of the website, Cannibal Club claims:  “Most of the businesses and institutions who supply us prefer to keep those relationships discreet. On the individual level, bodies are often bequeathed to us. For some, this is a way to supplement life insurance and offset funerary expenses. For others, such as Cannibal Club member Gwendoline Fenwich, who was served to her friends and relatives at the Club in January of 2008, being prepared as a meal, and thereby reborn into the bodies of the living, is an attractive alternative to the more the traditional practices of burial and cremation.“  The revelation that Hollywood royalty, pop stars and cable TV anchors consume human flesh when they are in Los Angeles is merely the latest example of public figures being exposed as dark figures, reveling in the darkness. Jay-Z described Jesus Christ as “the original fake news“ late in 2017. Miley Cyrus said “Hail Satan” on live radio and claimed she has a closer relationship with the devil than with her “earthly father”, Billy R","Prominent Figures Indulge in Cannibalism at LA's Underground Cannibal Club

A leaked document from the secretive Cannibal Club in Los Angeles has unveiled some of its high-profile members, including Meryl Streep, Chelsea Clinton, Anderson Cooper, and Katy Perry. Known for its experimental cuisine, the restaurant specializes in serving human meat sourced from young and healthy bodies. Visiting chefs from around the world come to practice their craft free of compromise and convention at the exclusive establishment. Cannibal Club caters to a distinguished clientele consisting of filmmakers, intellectuals, and celebrities who embody ideals such as free expression and rationalism. The website emphasizes the artistic excellence celebrated at the restaurant, with avant-garde performances and esteemed literary figures entertaining guests. Chef de Cuisine Sophie Laffite describes each dish as a study in taste and elegance, highlighting the selection of the meat, which is viewed as a homage to the dead in many primitive societies. The private nature of the restaurant is maintained through a strict vetting policy, ensuring that only enlightened individuals are admitted. The current menu features various dishes prepared with human meat, such as flame-broiled sirloin steak and placenta lasagne. The sources of the human flesh remain discreet, with some bodies being bequeathed to the club by willing individuals. This revelation adds to a growing trend of public figures embracing darkness and pushing boundaries."

gossipcop-8055383376,1,0,"Yes, the headline sounds extremely insane, but then again this is Teresa Giudice we’re talking about here!  According to a new report, the Real Housewives of New Jersey star is planning to cash in on her husband Joe Giudice’s deportation proceedings.  If you recall, it was reported weeks ago that a judge had ruled that Joe should be deported upon his release from prison, where he is currently serving a 41-month-prison sentence for bank and wire fraud. Well now, sources are telling Radar Online that Bravo has offered Teresa $500,000 to film a special about his deportation.  “Teresa was offered big bucks to film a special about Joe’s deportation and she agreed to do it,” an insider revealed. “Half a million dollars to share the story on camera.”  And this story is believable because this isn’t Teresa’s first rodeo when it comes to cashing in on her crimes legal drama!  “It is going to be like the other specials when she was in prison and will show how she and Joe and the girls are handling the scary prospect of Joe getting deported,” added the source.  IS TERESA BEGGING PRESIDENT TRUMP TO STOP JOE’S DEPORTATION?  Earlier this year, an Immigration official confirmed that “records show that an immigration judge ordered Mr. Giudice be removed from the United States on March 14, 2018.”  A source close to Teresa adds that she needs the Bravo money as Joe tries to appeal the deportation order.  “Teresa will do anything for the money. She never stops thinking about taking care of her girls and she agreed to this so that they would have money for college. She is a good mom and wants to provide for her children,” the source stated.  Joe will reportedly be turned over to ICE custody upon his March 2019 release, although it is likely he could be released earlier than March which would mean an earlier deportation back to Italy.  UPDATE – Teresa is denying this report. Her attorney, James Leonard, tells the Gossip Cop website that she has no current plans to do a spinoff show about Joe’s possible deportation.

gossipcop-5210414258,1,0,"The things you plan the least sometimes turn out the best. This is why every right-thinking person hates St Valentine’s Day. Scheduling a day for romance is as joyful as a deflated heart-shaped balloon.  We’re in Stanley’s on St Andrew’s Street in Dublin, downstairs in the wine bar. It’s an unplanned outing after an impromptu cry of “Let’s go out, but not to our usual place”. I’ve eaten here before, and enjoyed it except for some oversalted fish. This is a second chance. They don’t come easily.  But two things happened after the previous review. First, a man who was at the next table wrote to me to say how much he loved Stanley’s. He had no vested interest, but was talking as a well-dined eater about town. Later, I found out that chef and co-owner Stephen McArdle had something more important on his hands than my dinner that night. His son had been born hours before.  If that doesn’t earn a second chance, nothing will. So we’re tucked in at a small table under the sloping ceiling. The walls are painted a soft green. There’s a candle in a wax-crusted wine bottle on the table and high-class jazz standards on the sound system.  For the moment, it feels like we’re not in Dublin. We could be in a city anywhere and lucky enough to find a place we’ll remember fondly when we get home.  The menu is chalked up on the wall and Liam has already ordered some cod croquettes, balls of soft fluffy fish in crispy lagging jackets sitting in a small puddle of silken house mayonnaise.  The star of Stanley’s is Morgan Vanderkamer. She’s the sommelier here. But don’t let that put you off. Bad sommeliers are pretentious up-sellers, there to push diners towards the wallet-busting bruisers on the wine list. Vanderkamer has taken the nonsense out of the role and will open your mind to new ideas about what to drink with your food. If you thought sherry was for fogeys and posers, she will change your mind. So we have ice-cold glasses of manzanilla to cut through the fluffy cod croquettes. We are in excellent hands.  The main event is the Irish charcuterie sharing plate. We’re going with an oloroso, the ruby-coloured sherry that gets its colour and kick from time and ageing. There are two on the menu, Vanderkamer says. One is good; the other is “amazing”, and priced accordingly, she warns. With a €16 plate of food between us, we push the sherry cask out and live it large on the oloroso at €13 a glass. It is a good decision.  There’s a small farmyard on that €16 charcuterie plate: generous slices of duck ham, smoked cured slices of moist pink meat. The duck ham is the soulmate of the apricot puree dotted on one side of the plate. The sharp pickled gherkins sing with the “bacon and cabbage”, a slice of ham hock terrine wrapped in crinkly soft leaves of bright-green savoy cabbage. There are two small delicate slabs of mi-cuit fois gras, delicate to the point of dissolving on contact with the tongue. The pear and vanilla sauce, in a small ramekin, takes the sweetness of the liver to another even more decadent place.  Just in case there isn’t enough on the plate (there is), we’ve ordered a plate of the bean and chorizo stew. The beans are in fact chick peas – but that’s even better in my book – and the chorizo has been minced to a small rubble that sits on top of the soupy mix. It’s the kind of stew where the juices have transformed from separate elements of meat, tomato, oil and wine into one glistening sheen. We get a blended Priorat, a Spanish red as heartwarming as the stew, to sip with it.  Dessert would be an option only for people less greedy in their savoury ordering. There’s a final glass of Rasteau, a fortified Grenache that’s served deliciously chilly. It’s a thought-provoking alternative to a syrupy dessert wine, and next time we’ll leave space for some cheese to go with it.  Romantic is a bleached-out word, but that’s what Stanley’s wine bar is: a properly love-it romantic joint, a new favourite to add to your list.  Dinner for two, with sherries a","Sometimes, the best outcomes come from the least planned endeavors. This is precisely why St Valentine's Day is despised by individuals who think rationally. Allocating a specific day for romance is as joyful as a deflated heart-shaped balloon. Currently, I am at Stanley's, located on St Andrew's Street in Dublin. This impromptu outing to a different location was prompted by a spontaneous decision of ""Let's go out, but not to our usual place."" I have dined here in the past and enjoyed it, except for the excessively salty fish. Nonetheless, I am giving it a second chance, as they are not easily earned. Two significant incidents occurred after my previous review. Firstly, a man sitting at the adjacent table wrote to inform me of his love for Stanley's. He had no personal interest in the matter but spoke as an experienced frequenter of establishments in town. Additionally, I later discovered that the chef and co-owner, Stephen McArdle, had a significant event on the same night as my previous dinner - the birth of his son. If that does not warrant a second opportunity, then nothing will. Therefore, we find ourselves comfortably seated at a small table beneath the sloping ceiling. The walls are painted in a soft green hue, and a candle in a wax-covered wine bottle adorns the table. The ambiance is complemented by the playing of high-quality jazz standards in the background, momentarily making it feel like we are not in Dublin. It could be any city, and we are fortunate enough to stumble upon a place that will be fondly remembered upon returning home. The menu, conveniently written on the wall, has already enticed Liam to order cod croquettes - delectable balls of tender fish encased in crispy exteriors, accompanied by a luscious house mayonnaise. The star of Stanley's is their sommelier, Morgan Vanderkamer. However, do not let that discourage you. Often, sommeliers can be excessively pretentious and push patrons towards expensive wines on the list. Vanderkamer, however, has eliminated all the nonsense from her role and will guide you towards innovative drink choices to complement your meal. If you previously discredited sherry as outdated or for pretentious individuals, she will change your perspective. Hence, we are served ice-cold glasses of manzanilla to perfectly complement the fluffy cod croquettes, ensuring we are in excellent hands. The highlight of the evening is the Irish charcuterie sharing plate. We opt for an oloroso, a ruby-colored sherry that derives its flavor and potency from aging. Vanderkamer highlights that there are two options on the menu, with one being good and the other being ""amazing,"" but priced accordingly. Considering our €16 plate of food between the two of us, we splurge on the €13 per glass oloroso. It proves to be a wise decision. The €16 charcuterie plate resembles a small farm with generous slices of duck ham, moist and pink smoked cured meat. The combination of the duck ham and apricot puree on one side of the plate is soulful. The sharpness of the pickled gherkins pairs beautifully with the ""bacon and cabbage,"" which consists of ham hock terrine wrapped in tender savoy cabbage leaves. Additionally, two delicate slabs of mi-cuit fois gras, almost dissolving upon touching the tongue, adorn the plate. The pear and vanilla sauce, served in a small ramekin, elevates the liver's sweetness to an even more indulgent level. In case the charcuterie plate is not sufficient (it is), we have ordered a plate of bean and chorizo stew. Surprisingly, the beans are actually chickpeas, which proves to be a delightful addition. The chorizo has been artistically minced into a rubble-like texture, adding flavor to the soupy mix. The stew has melded all its components - meat, tomato, oil, and wine - into a glistening sheen, creating a harmonious blend. To complement the stew, we are served a blended Priorat, a heartwarming Spanish red. Dessert is only reserved for those who show restraint in their savory choices. We co"

Amidst rumors that the actress is marrying a British businessman, she’s put permanent roots down in California by purchasing the massive Cecil B. DeMille estate — check out pics of the lavish mansion here.  Angelina Jolie, 41, has a new home in Los Angeles…and it’s stunning. It’s been rumored for weeks that the 41-year-old had plans to purchase Cecil B. DeMille’s historic mansion, and now, she’s bit the bullet, putting down a $25 million offer, according to TMZ. The amount was reportedly accepted by the owner and is currently in escrow.  Cecil’s home, which he lived in until his death in 1959, is considered one of the greatest properties in L.A., and Angie will have some famous neighbors, including Casey Affleck, Natalie Portman and Ellen Pompeo. There’s tons of space for the six kids, too — the house boasts 6 bedrooms and 10 bathrooms, plus a spacious backyard.  This huge purchase comes following rumors that Angie planned on moving her kids to London so she could work there after her September 2016 split from Brad Pitt, 53. The possibility of that big move happening seemed even more likely after reports surfaced on April 12 that Angie had met and fallen in love with a British philanthropist and businessman, whose identity has not been revealed.  The actress is reportedly already serious with this mystery man, and a family friend told InTouch that she’s even planning on marrying him! However, we also know that Brad and Angie’s divorce has been much more amicable recently, and she’s been letting him spend more and more time with the kids. Perhaps staying in Los Angeles is her way of making sure Pax, Maddox, Zahara, Shiloh, Vivienne and Knox continue to have a relationship with their father? Either way, the house is insane — check it out in the gallery above.  HollywoodLifers, what do you think of Angelina’s new house? Do you think she’s prepping for a wedding?","After spending $25 million, Angelina Jolie has purchased a new residence in Los Angeles. The speculation surrounding her potential marriage to a British entrepreneur has not deterred her from establishing permanent roots in California. The lavish Cecil B. DeMille estate is her latest acquisition, offering a glimpse into the stunning mansion through provided photographs. The 41-year-old actress had been rumored to have plans of purchasing this historic property for several weeks and has now followed through by making a $25 million offer, which has been accepted by the owner and is currently in escrow. The property, which was once occupied by Cecil B. DeMille until his passing in 1959, holds significant prestige in LA and will provide Angie with well-known neighbors such as Casey Affleck, Natalie Portman, and Ellen Pompeo. With 6 bedrooms, 10 bathrooms, and a spacious backyard, there is enough space for her six children. This substantial investment comes amidst rumors that Angie intended to relocate her children to London for work purposes following her separation from Brad Pitt in September 2016. These rumors gained traction after reports emerged on April 12 stating that Angie had met a British philanthropist and businessman whom she was deeply in love with, but whose identity remained undisclosed. It is speculated that she plans to marry this mystery man. Nevertheless, her divorce from Brad Pitt has become more amicable recently, and she has allowed him to spend increasing amounts of time with their children. Staying in Los Angeles could be a way for her to ensure that Pax, Maddox, Zahara, Shiloh, Vivienne, and Knox maintain a strong relationship with their father. Whatever her reasons, her new house is undeniably impressive. What are your thoughts on Angelina Jolie's new residence? Do you believe it signifies preparations for an upcoming wedding?"
gossipcop-8609335343,1,0,"Oh boy.  The first rule of going solo: Distance yourself as far as possible from the group and fan base that jump-started your career. Or so goes the advice Liam Payne is apparently following from Zayn: He’s the last to venture out on his own and the first to come out burning a bridge he still has to cross when it’s all said and done. On Liam’s first single, “Strip That Down,” he’s dissed One Direction plain as day. “You know I used to be in 1D, now I’m out free,” he sings. “People want me for one thing, that’s not me. I’m not changing the way that I used to be, I just want to have fun and get rowdy.”    But with nearly all remaining members of One Direction releasing new music of their own within weeks of each other, this song is not the only opportunity Payne has had to make his thoughts on his bandmates known. Speaking with Music Choice, he complimented Niall Horan’s new singles, but Harry Styles, not so much. “I’ll be honest with you, it’s not my sort of music. It’s not something I’d listen to,” he said. But he did have a quick save: “I think he did a great job of doing what he wanted to do. That’s the way I’d put it best, I think.” Liam also noted that Harry would probably say the same about his music since Harry doesn’t listen to hip-hop. “My song’s more ‘Rack City’ and his song is more of a different era to something I’d listen to, I guess,” he said. “Strip That Down” does feature a rapper, Migos’s Quavo, but a redux of the only song of note that Tyga has ever made it is not.","Liam Payne is following the advice of Zayn by distancing himself from his group and fan base, which jump-started his career. On his first single, ""Strip That Down,"" Liam openly disses One Direction, stating that he wants to have fun and get rowdy. This is not the only opportunity he has had to express his thoughts on his bandmates' music, as he compliments Niall Horan's new singles but admits that Harry Styles' music is not his taste. Despite this, Liam acknowledges that Harry did a great job of doing what he wanted to do. Liam also mentions that Harry probably wouldn't listen to his music either, as their styles differ. While ""Strip That Down"" features a rapper, it is not a redo of Tyga's popular song ""Rack City."""

gossipcop-4796409702,1,0,"Kim Kardashian is allegedly “phasing out” mom Kris Jenner, particularly when it comes to her responsibilities as her longtime manager, amid reports Kim is ready for a total image overhaul after returning to the spotlight following her October robbery.  That’s according to a new report by Radar Online, who’s claiming that the mother-daughter duo could be caught in a nasty feud as a source alleged that Kardashian has had somewhat of an epiphany during her time away from the spotlight and allegedly has now opened her eyes to see how Jenner “used her” to build the Kardashian brand.  According to the site, Kim is ready to project a very different image from the uber-glamorous money flaunting Kardashian fans used to know and is allegedly ready to kick mom Kris to the curb, at least professionally, in order to do so.  A source alleged to the site this week that Kim now “seems to be thinking that Kris used her to get where she is today,” which Radar Online is alleging could have led to a nasty feud between Jenner and her daughter as well as the reality star reportedly making a pretty big business decision when it comes to her mom.  “[Kim] will never think of [Kris] in the same way again,” the source said of Jenner’s supposed drama with her daughter amid reports she believes Jenner has been “using” her for years.  The site then went on to report that Kim is now in the process of projecting her new toned-down image amid the feud claims with Kris, revealing that Jenner may no longer play such a big part in Kardashian’s career going forward.  “Kim hired a transition team to make sure that she gives off a different image than she did previously,” the source said of Jenner and her daughter potentially parting ways professionally, claiming that “part of this process includes phasing out [Kris’s] management.”  While Kris and Kim have not commented on the claims, this isn’t the first time it’s been reported that Kardashian may be looking to distance herself from Jenner, at least professionally, in the wake of her October robbery in Paris.  Radar Online claimed back in October that Kim Kardashian had grown wise to Kris Jenner’s “money making machine” after taking some downtime at the end of 2016, alleging at the time that Kim has been so busy with her career that she’s failed to realize how much Jenner, who is often referred to as her “momager,” had been controlling her life and career.  “Kim never realized how much [Kris] and the money-making machine was controlling her until this robbery,” an insider told the site of Kardashian’s feelings about Jenner at the time, months before it was reported that the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star is allegedly looking to “phase out” Kris from her career.  “Kim is just starting to think that maybe Kris’s intentions were not pure all along,” continued the source in October, adding that Kim has been doing a lot of thinking about her father Robert Kardashian while taking some time away which has allegedly helped her to get wise to Kris’s seemingly relentless pursuit of fame for herself and her family.  “[Kim] told her family that she wanted to be the girl that her father wanted her to be and not the girl that she became with Kris’s help,” a source revealed last year, just months before it was reported that a feud could be brewing between Kardashian and Jenner.  What do you think of reports claiming Kim Kardashian and mom Kris Jenner could be caught in a feud amid claims Kim is attempting to “phase out” her mother’s management?  [Featured Image by Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images]","Kim Kardashian is reportedly distancing herself from her mom Kris Jenner, especially in terms of her managerial role. After her return to the spotlight following a robbery in October, Kim is said to be ready for a complete image transformation. Radar Online claims that the mother-daughter duo might be involved in a feud as Kim has supposedly realized how Jenner had allegedly used her to build the Kardashian brand. Kim is allegedly ready to project a different, more subdued image, and may be planning to separate professionally from her mom. Reports suggest that Kim now believes Kris used her to achieve her own success, and this alleged drama has strained their relationship. Kim is said to be working on rebranding herself and phasing out Kris's management. Although Kris and Kim have not responded to these claims, this is not the first time it has been suggested that Kim wants to distance herself from her mom, especially after the Paris robbery. It was reported in October that Kim had become aware of Kris's control over her life and career. Kim has been contemplating her relationship with Kris and is striving to be the person her late father would have wanted her to be, rather than the person she became with Kris's influence. The question remains, what do you think of the reports stating that Kim Kardashian and Kris Jenner could be embroiled in a feud as Kim tries to separate herself from her mother's management?"

gossipcop-3967904178,1,0,"Watch Entertainment Tonight on Yahoo View.  Music’s odd couple, Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton — aka the rocker and the country boy — have never been free of gossip speculating about their relationship. Apparently, the latest news is that the two are through. In Touch Weekly reports that Shelton actually unceremoniously dumped Stefani in February before embarking on a tour.  But wait — if that’s the case, then why is Stefani appearing with him on stage? And not just appearing … they’re appearing pretty cuddly. The singer posted an Instagram shot on Mar. 14 of the two embracing on what appears to be the most recent date of his “Country Music Freaks” trek.      This isn’t the first such picture she has shared since February. She posted several different angles of a jumbotron kiss on Feb. 25, and on March 11, one of herself hanging out with country up-and-comer Carly Pearce, who is an opener on Shelton’s tour, and another that shows off a backstage crowd (including Shelton and her younger brother Todd) in Greensboro, N.C.      Additionally, she sent good wishes to him on Mar. 1 — when Shelton was reportedly attempting to power through a Houston date while sick with the flu — and shared his latest video, “I Lived It” with a glowing string of hashtags.      So if the breakup is fake news, what spurred the rumors? According to In Touch‘s “insider” source, all of Stefani’s social media support is “a desperate attempt to ignore the truth,” and Shelton dumped her due to her “neediness and all the drama: her demanding, critical ex-husband, and her jealousy of him and other women.”  If this is to be believed, current Voice champion Chloe Kohanski was a factor in the breakup — Coach Shelton was apparently getting too close for Stefani’s comfort — as well as Shelton’s ex-wife Miranda Lambert, with whom the outlet claims he has rekindled a friendship and is “sharing intimate details” of his life.  Shelton isn’t reciprocating Stefani’s loving social media deluge — but then again, he’s never been one to do so. His social media accounts, once a source of ribald jokes, have developed gradually into a more businesslike platform to market his music and work on The Voice. He does, however, maintain a picture of Stefani as his profile photo.  Read more from Yahoo Entertainment:","Tune in to Entertainment Tonight on Yahoo View.

And you know what? They don’t even realize what is happening to them. They are so corrupted, they can’t even see what is right in front of their eyes.”  “First they had the drought that lasted years and years, killing off billions and billions of dollars in crops, and making the soil so incredibly dry that a large rainstorm could easily turn into a major flood.  “Then they had the fires. Awful, awful fires. Historical, deadly fires. Thousands lost their homes, scores lost their lives and their livelihoods. Did you know the Thomas fire is still burning? In the winter!“  “And now they just had dozens of homes destroyed by mudslides,” Tennessee-born Parton said, making reference to the mudslides that have killed 15 people, with the toll expected to climb above 30. The mudslide hit an affluent part of California, and damaged Oprah Winfrey’s house.  “When they get hit with the ‘Big One‘, Parton said, referencing the popular name for the super quake expected to rock California in the future, “then we will know that the End Times have truly begun.”  “And don’t forget the sexual abuse scandals rocking Hollywood. They are being punished for embracing Satan and rejecting God.”  Is California suffering from bad weather and bad luck, or is Parton right? Could a vengeful God be punishing California for decades of vice and sin?  Parton, who has sold more than 100 million records worldwide and been nominated for two Academy Awards, has previously stated that she considers herself an entertainer, and doesn’t believe it is her role to get involved with politics.  At last year’s Emmys, Parton was joined onstage by Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda to present an award. Tomlin and Fonda took the opportunity to criticize President Donald Trump, but Parton refused to join in, maintaining a dignified silence.","Country singer Dolly Parton believes that California is going through a series of catastrophic events due to their embrace of Satan and rejection of God.

In a video being circulated, which is entitled - Rihanna: ‘If Jesus Hasn’t Answered Your Prayers, Try Satan’, published December 2, 2017, on the World News Today YouTube Channel, a scripted voice says that Rihanna told the audience that growing up in Bridgetown was not easy and that you have to work twice as hard to make it. And the British anonymous voice went on to say that she said:  ""You have to hustle. I’m still hustling, but I am living proof that you can do anything... If you came here for tips I can give y’all the biggest one straight off...  ""If y'all have prayed to Jesus for years, prayed with all your hearts and got nothing back from him? ... Jesus doesn't care about you. Do you really even think he even listening? Hot tip y'all because you are my people, be efficient, go to satan.""  Then it went on to claim that the Prime Minister of Barbados the Rt. Hon. Freundel Stuart intervened hastily and shocked parents removed their children. On the night in question, the Prime Minister conferred the title of Cultural Ambassador on Robyn 'Rihanna' Fenty.

Honoured, the young Grammy-award winner encouraged children and persons to believe in their dreams and have faith in God.  Rihanna told the crowd which included her friends and family, and numerous dignitaries, that she had no idea how she would get discovered on this little Rock but her dreams started on Westbury New Road, now named Rihanna Drive and she believed in her dreams, so ""believe in your dreams"", as cliche as it may sound.  Rihanna added:  ""I always knew it would happen, I always focused on the result, and that kind of faith, it really was just faith that childlike faith, that even now when I get a little bit discouraged or doubtful, it’s the thing that I go back to, having faith in God, like that even as a child.”  (Photo caption: Rihanna with her head bowed during the opening prayer at the renaming ceremony.

gossipcop-2682199068,1,1,"Reverend Swadley – the local wedding priest and friend of the Pitt family – has confirmed to friends that the A-list couple recently spent a week with Brad’s family, discussing detailed plans for a wedding.  It’s believed the loved-up stars had flown to Missouri because Jen was desperate to reconnect with Brad’s mum, Jane, who she’d developed a very close bond with throughout the time of their first marriage.  During the seven-day visit, it’s been revealed that Jane orchestrated a meeting with the family priest Reverend Swadley – hoping it would be the gentle push Brad and Jen would need to make their reignited relationship official once again.  ‘Reverend Swadley met Jen recently at a family function that Brad’s mum, Jane, threw at their family home in Missouri,’ a close friend of the pastor’s told New Idea exclusively.  ‘Jen accompanied Brad home on the trip and attended church services with the family as well as joining Brad at meetings at the now-retired reverend’s home, who Brad reconnected with after he decided to find himself and renew his faith, following his split from Ange.  ‘He remarked at how at ease Jen was with his family, who clearly adore her, and how everyone said how much she’s been missed and how happy they all were to have her back in Brad’s – and their – lives.’  The source goes on to reveal that Reverend Swadley spoke at length with Brad and Jen about getting married as soon as possible, in Missouri, in a small ceremony, with just local friends and family present.  ‘Reverend Swadley revealed how in love Brad and Jen were and how they planned to officially wed as soon as their divorces were finalised, with him agreeing to conduct the ceremony and welcome them both back into the church,’ the friend of the pastor told New Idea.  Reverend Swadley revealed to our source that it was clear Jen loved seeing Brad’s family again, spending long days talking and laughing for the first time since their 2005 divorce.  ‘Jen spent five days reconnecting with Brad’s parents, brother and sister and many of his childhood friends who he remains close to,’ a friend of the pastor reveals.  Brad Pitt's parents are nothing but supportive Getty  ‘He said Jen kept saying how grateful she was that they’d been brought back together. And how they’ll both be baptised later this year before they officially wed – with Jen’s father, John, vowing to be at her side for the service and give her away again at their wedding, which will hopefully take place shortly after and be far more low-key than their original star-studded nuptials in Malibu.’  It’s the latest chapter in the pair’s rekindled romance since Jen announced her split from estranged husband Justin Theroux in February. She has wasted no time in rebuilding her relationship with ex-husband Brad, spending time with his six children, and developing a unique and special bond with his 11-year-old daughter Shiloh.  It’s that close relationship between Jen and his kids that has prompted Brad to want to marry Jen as soon as soon as possible.  ‘Brad’s mum Jane was all over them to get married as soon as possible, but the truth is Brad needs no convincing,’ says a source close to Brad. ‘They still want to keep this relationship close to their chest and out of the public eye, but behind closed doors they couldn’t be happier.  ‘And for Brad, seeing how much his children – especially Shiloh – love Jen has just made his heart soar. He knows he wants Jen to be his wife again.  ‘We’re pretty sure they’ll be married in Missouri before the end of the year, Brad and Jen are both keen to push through their divorces as soon as possible so they can walk down the aisle together. That’s all that they want.’  For the full story see this weeks issue of New Idea - out now!","Reverend Swadley, a close friend of the Pitt family and the local wedding priest, has informed acquaintances that the celebrity couple spent a week with Brad's family in Missouri to discuss detailed wedding plans. The purpose of their visit was for Jen to reconnect with Brad's mother, Jane, whom she had formed a close bond with during their previous marriage. During their stay, Jane organized a meeting between the couple and Reverend Swadley, hoping that it would encourage Brad and Jen to formalize their reignited relationship. A friend of the pastor disclosed that Reverend Swadley met Jen at a family event hosted by Jane at their home in Missouri. Throughout the visit, Jen accompanied Brad to church services and attended meetings at the retired reverend's house. Reverend Swadley expressed that Jen fit in comfortably with Brad's family, who greatly cherished her presence and expressed their happiness at her return to their lives. The anonymous source further revealed that Reverend Swadley discussed marriage plans with Brad and Jen, suggesting a small ceremony in Missouri with only close friends and relatives. The pastor also agreed to officiate the wedding and welcome them back into the church once their divorces were finalized. Our insider shared that it was evident to Reverend Swadley that Jen cherished the opportunity to spend time with Brad's family, sharing laughter and conversations like they hadn't since their divorce in 2005. During this visit, Jennifer spent five days reconnecting with Brad's parents, siblings, and childhood friends. Jen repeatedly expressed her gratitude for being reunited with them and mentioned plans for both her and Brad to be baptized before the wedding. Her father, John, promised to be present at the baptism and to walk her down the aisle again, making the occasion more intimate than their previous extravagant wedding in Malibu. This recent development in their rekindled romance follows Jennifer's separation from her estranged husband, Justin Theroux, in February. Jennifer wasted no time building her relationship with Brad, spending time with his six children and forming a strong bond with his 11-year-old daughter, Shiloh. It is this close bond between Jennifer and the children that has led Brad to desire a quick marriage. According to a source close to Brad, his mother has been encouraging them to marry soon, but Brad needs no persuasion as he wants Jennifer to be his wife once again. Although they prefer to keep their relationship private, behind closed doors, they are extremely happy. It is likely that they will get married in Missouri before the end of the year, as Brad and Jen are eager to finalize their divorces and walk down the aisle together."

There are a lot of things we can do about it. But we don’t. Which is interesting, because when someone with a beard attacks us, we tap phones, we invoke travel bans, we build walls. We take every possible precaution to make sure it doesn’t happen again. But when an American buys a gun and kills other Americans, then there’s nothing we can do about that. Because [of] the Second Amendment. Our forefathers wanted us to have AK47s, is the argument.”  And before showing the faces of the 56 senators who voted against new and tighter gun laws just days after the shooting in Orlando last year, Kimmel said, “They should be praying. They should be praying for God to forgive them for letting the gun lobby run this country. Because it is, it is so crazy.”  Among those commenting on the late night host’s powerful and emotional monologue is Rosie O’Donnell, who said, “Jimmy Kimmel is an American hero – [watch] his Emotional Monologue About The Mass Shooting In Las Vegas #useURvoice.” Olivia Wilde similarly wrote, “A powerful call to action.

Today, however, the FCC put an end to the fun, saying in a statement: “Consistent with standard operating procedure, the FCC’s Enforcement Bureau has reviewed the complaints and the material that was the subject of these complaints.”  “The Bureau has concluded that there was nothing actionable under the FCC’s rules.”  In rough numbers, the FCC was saying that programs airing on broadcast TV stations before 10 PM are subject to fine if the commission determines they are “indecent.” Shows that run in late-night, however, have a different threshold: content must be ruled “obscene” for stations to be fined.

New Idea claims that the Legally Blonde star is unhappy with her Australian, Big Little Lies co-star’s failure to promote the HBO series in the run-up to its debut in February, claiming that Nicole used too much of her airtime to discuss her latest Hollywood hit, Lion.  “Reese is furious that Nicole hasn’t done more to support Big Little Lies. All she talked about in the interviews was Lion. Had Reese known that Nicole would put the show so far on the back-burner, she would have cast some random person in the show,” Daily Mail quoted a source as saying.  Red carpet roundup: Golden girls at Oscars 2017  In Australia, Big Little Lies‘ debut outranked any HBO series broadcast on Foxtel in a launch week, more than doubling the audience that tuned in to see Game of Thrones‘ first-ever episode.  But New Idea suggests that it’s the underwhelming reception in her own home country that has left Reese disappointed. Reese is one of the executive producers for the show after all.  According to the publication, frosty relations between the pair manifested themselves at the Oscars last month. “You could cut the tension with a knife at the Oscars. Nicole was telling her people to keep Reese away from her,” claimed the source.  News of the pair being involved in “some tense arguments” during filming were also reported by the publication, which alleged that the Hollywood heavyweights may never work together again.  An insider claimed, “If the show doesn’t make any waves or get better ratings, it will probably mark the end of Reese and Nicole’s joint ventures.”  However, a representative of Daily Mail Australia says the story is completely incorrect. “Everyone is thrilled to the back teeth with Big Little Lies. They’re (Reese and Nicole) great friends, they love each other and they love the way each other works.”  Another source has denied New Idea’s claims that Nicole had not been promoting the show as much as fellow cast members, saying that the 49-year-old did a ‘shed load’ of publicity both in America and abroad. The report comes just two months after she spoke about the actresses’ friendship in California. “We’re very, very close friends. We’re able to talk about everything,” she said.

Jolie made her screen debut as a child alongside her father, Jon Voight, in Lookin' to Get Out (1982). Her film career began in earnest a decade later with the low-budget production Cyborg 2 (1993), followed by her first leading role in a major film, Hackers (1995). She starred in the critically acclaimed biographical cable films George Wallace (1997) and Gia (1998), and won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the drama Girl, Interrupted (1999). Jolie's starring role as the video game heroine Lara Croft in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) established her as a leading Hollywood actress. She continued her successful action-star career with Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), Wanted (2008), and Salt (2010), and received critical acclaim for her performances in the dramas A Mighty Heart (2007) and Changeling (2008), which earned her a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actress. Her biggest commercial success came with the fantasy picture Maleficent (2014). In the 2010s, Jolie expanded her career into directing, screenwriting, and producing, with In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011), Unbroken (2014), By the Sea (2015), and First They Killed My Father (2017). In addition to her film career, Jolie is noted for her humanitarian efforts, for which she has received a Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award and an honorary damehood of the Order of St Michael and St George (DCMG), among other honors. She promotes various causes, including conservation, education, and women's rights, and is most noted for her advocacy on behalf of refugees as a Special Envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). As a public figure, Jolie has been cited as one of the most influential and powerful people in the American entertainment industry. For a number of years, she was cited as the world's most beautiful woman by various media outlets, and her personal life is the subject of wide publicity.

Joe Jonas looks like he’s having a blast on the beach! The 28-year-old was spotted surrounded by a group of bikini-clad women on Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia on Feb. 22 — but none of which were Sophie Turner. Don’t worry, though! The girls were just fans of the DNCE frontman, who graciously posed for photos with them on the sunny shoreline. How sweet!  The “Cake By The Ocean” singer went Down Under to shoot the upcoming season of The Voice Australia, which he will be a celebrity coach on, alongside Delta Goodrem, Kelly Rowland, and Boy George. While his fiancée didn’t make the trip, the couple were able to spend some quality time together before Joe’s excursion to the Southern Hemisphere. Earlier this month, the pair enjoyed a romantic getaway to a private island in the Maldives, and then followed up the vacation with a huge celebration in New York City for Sophie’s 22nd birthday on Feb. 21. Joe’s brother Nick Jonas even commemorated the occasion by giving a sweet shout-out to the birthday girl. He shared a photo from Sophie and Joe’s engagement party in Nov. 2017, and captioned the pic that also included Kevin and Frankie Jonas, “Happy Birthday @sophiet You’re super cool! We all think so!” Aww, it’s like she’s already part of the family!  You can also bet that the Game Of Thrones star wouldn’t mind her fiancé posing for photos with a bunch of beauties on the beach. On her birthday, Sophie posted a video to her Instagram story jamming out to “22” by Taylor Swift (as any self-respecting 22-year-old would do on their birthday). As you may remember, Tay and Joe used to be a ~thing~ back in 2008. But clearly, that doesn’t phase the X-Men: Apocalypse star in the slightest — nor should it. Taylor has her own Joe (Alwyn) now, and the Josie star has made it clear there’s no bad blood between them. She even came to the singer’s defense when people on Twitter questioned her inclusion in TIME‘s Person of the Year issue in December. Basically Sophie is the best, and we’re sure Joe knows that!

MORE: JENNIFER ANISTON’S AND JUSTIN THEROUX’S DOG CUSTODY BATTLE  It seems like no one has been reported pregnant more times than Jen.The earliest reports date back to 1999, back when the world first fell in love with her on Friends and she began dating Brad Pitt. Since 1999 there have been more than 55 published articles about her being pregnant both in and outside the U.S. It was even reported by the Huffington Post that despite the possibility that the U.S would go into war “Jennifer Aniston Pregnant” was still searched more than “are we at war” on Google.  Jennifer did express in early interviews that she wanted to become a mother one day and from then on the world was waiting. The obsession with her character on Friends—and the fact that Rachel did get pregnant—could be the reason why fans kept a close eye on is she or isn’t she in real life. In fact, the roles Jennifer took on in her career often had a direct impact on when and how her pregnancy rumors evolved.  Over time the extremity of the rumors changed, but many of the triggers are the same. Rumors start any time she is wearing a loose shirt or looks “bloated,” whenever she is in a new relationship, and whenever that relationship ends. And most importantly, the rumors evolve as she ages.  MORE: JENNIFER ANISTON BANS THE WORD “BABY” AROUND HER  Take a look at almost two decades worth of pregnancy rumors and how they progressed:","Not all women desire to have children, and that is completely acceptable. While regular individuals may face pressure from friends and family to conceive, celebrities endure pressure from the entire world. Amongst famous individuals, Jennifer Aniston has faced the most intense public pressure to have a baby. People are obsessed with the idea of her becoming a mother. Jennifer has been subjected to numerous false reports of pregnancy, dating back to 1999 when she gained fame from her role in Friends and began dating Brad Pitt. Since then, there have been over 55 published articles about her being pregnant, both within and outside of the United States. Surprisingly, during a time when the possibility of the U.S. going to war was a concern, searches for ""Jennifer Aniston Pregnant"" surpassed searches for ""are we at war"" on Google, as reported by the Huffington Post. In initial interviews, Jennifer did express her desire to become a mother someday, which only intensified public interest in her personal life. Fans closely monitored her pregnancy status, perhaps influenced by her character on Friends who became pregnant. Additionally, Jennifer's choice of roles in her career often fueled speculation about her pregnancy. Over the years, the nature of the rumors has changed, but the catalysts behind them remain consistent. Rumors often start when she is seen wearing loose clothing or appears bloated, during the start of a new relationship, or after the end of a relationship. Interestingly, the rumors also evolve as she ages. This article provides a comprehensive look at nearly two decades of pregnancy rumors surrounding Jennifer Aniston and their progression over time."

gossipcop-5077951266,1,0,"The royal wedding is a multi-million dollar affair. Chris Jackson / Getty  The average cost of a wedding for couples in the US and the UK is around $34,000 (£23,700).  Five figures is a huge expense for a one-day affair. That is, unless you're ultra-rich — and especially if you're royalty rich.  Next month, the world will bear witness to the most anticipated royal wedding in years. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are set to be married on May 19 at St. George's Chapel, in Windsor, and will begin a carriage procession immediately after the ceremony. Their reception will take place later on the grounds of Windsor Castle.  Kensington Palace will cover the cost of the wedding, an expense traditionally taken on by the bride's family.  The case was the same for Kate Middleton and Prince William's 2011 royal wedding— the only item Middleton paid for was her six-figure Alexander McQueen dress. Their total wedding celebration cost $34 million (£23.7 million).  Markle and Prince Harry's wedding will reportedly cost in excess of $45.8 million (£32 million), according to Bride Book's estimation. That's over 1,000 more than the average wedding.  The venue is the biggest part of a typical wedding budget for couples in the US and the UK, taking up nearly half of the entire wedding cost. Access to St. George's Chapel — and St. George's Great Hall, where the wedding reception will take place — is free of charge for Markle and Prince Harry. Transportation is also free, thanks to the Queen's fleet of Rolls-Royces, Daimlers, and Bentleys.  The greatest cost for the royal couple? Security. Protecting Markle and Prince Harry, plus thousands of guests and onlookers, will run Kensington Palace a whopping $43 million (£30 million), estimates Bride Book. That includes the cost of snipers, undercover police, military technology, and security drones. The bulk of Kate Middleton and Prince William's wedding budget similarly went to security costs.  Otherwise, Markle and Prince Harry's total wedding spend, including food, cakes, entertainment, wardrobe, and the honeymoon, amounts to about $2.8 million.  Below, check out Bride Book's breakdown of what the royal wedding will cost.","The royal wedding, which is set to take place next month, is expected to be a costly event.

This was also the case for Kate Middleton and Prince William's wedding in 2011, where Middleton only paid for her dress.

Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's wedding is estimated to exceed that, with a price tag of over $45.8 million (£32 million), according to Bride Book.

gossipcop-9362271023,1,0,"(Video provided by Splash News)  The Weeknd instigated his breakup with Selena Gomez, Gossip Cop can confirm. Gomez’s rekindled friendship with Justin Bieber, however, had nothing to do with the rapper’s decision to end his romance with the singer.  As Gossip Cop reported, Gomez and The Weeknd recently split after nearly a year of dating. The pair weren’t seen together much during the summer, though it was later revealed the singer-actress was laying low due to a kidney transplant. Regardless, they still appeared to be going strong in the early fall. Prior to the announcement of their breakup, the status of their relationship was questioned after it emerged Gomez had rekindled her friendship with Bieber. © Gossip Cop (Getty Images)  On Sunday, that speculation swirled as Bieber and Gomez were seen in public and The Weeknd stopped following her friends on social media. That being said, Bieber was allegedly not responsible for the breakup. Rather, it was the challenges of a long-distance relationship, particularly with The Weeknd touring and Gomez’s shooting schedule, that led both the former couple to reconsider their fizzling relationship.  Additionally, contributing to their split, the rapper felt “tied down” in a relationship that had lost its spark. Over time, the pair started talking less frequently on the phone, prompting The Weeknd to end his romance with Gomez, reports TMZ. Despite their breakup, we’re told that the pair are still on good terms and have talked several times since the split.  Predictably, after the rapper ended his relationship with Gomez, Gossip Cop busted the often disproven HollywoodLife for claiming in a made-up report that The Weeknd was “heartbroken” over Gomez reconnecting with Bieber. In the bogus story, the bad blog ridiculously asserted that The Weeknd and Gomez were caught in a “love triangle” with Bieber, but of course, the breakup had nothing to do with and wasn’t caused by the “Love Yourself” singer.

Pitt is an honorary member of the Epidermolysis Bullosa Medical Research Foundation (EBMRF) that is dedicated to raising money and awareness for the rare skin disorder, epidermolysis bullosa.In January, Pitt introduced singer Chris Cornell during a Rock4EB annual charity to support EBMRF.Further, he revealed in a 2013 Esquire Magazine interview that he self-diagnosed himself with a rare disease – prosopagnosia — also known as face blindness.

Even if you've had what he calls ""a real conversation,"" your face will start fading from his memory as soon as you walk away.""It should be noted that being diagnosed with a condition and being self-diagnosed with a condition can be 2 very different diagnoses.Prosopagnosia refers to the inability to recognize familiar people from their face. They may also be unable to recognize other stimuli, such as objects, cars, or animals.People with prosopagnosia typically learn to use non-face cues including voice, walking style and hairstyle to recognize others. The underlying genetic cause of developmental prosopagnosia is not known but familial reports of this condition are consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance.Epidermolysis bullosa (aka 'the worst disease you've never heard of') is a group of devastating, life-threatening genetic skin disorders impacting children that is characterized by skin blisters and erosions all over the body.The most severe form, recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, is characterized by chronic skin blistering, open and painful wounds, joint contractures, esophageal strictures, pseudosyndactyly, corneal abrasions and a shortened life span. Patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa lack functional type VII collagen (C7) owing to mutations in the gene COL7A1 that encodes for C7 and is the main component of anchoring fibrils that attach the dermis to the epidermis.Epidermolysis bullosa patients suffer through intense pain throughout their lives, with no effective treatments available to reduce the severity of their symptoms.","On May 2, 2017, it was reported that Brad Pitt is not suffering from a rare disease.

NEW YORK CITY – President Trump's argument Tuesday that left wing groups were just as violent as the white supremacists who staged a demonstration in Charlottesville set off a firestorm of criticism from members of his own party – and raised questions about his personal views of racial tensions in the country.

Yet he was notably reticent to pinpoint the blame for one on Saturday that involved white supremacists – a point his critics on both sides of the aisle continued to hammer. ""We must be clear. White supremacy is repulsive. This bigotry is counter to all this country stands for. There can be no moral ambiguity,” said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. added: ""There is only one side to be on when a white supremacist mob brutalizes and murders in America.” Several lawmakers were dismayed the president appeared to equate white supremacists with their opponents. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., tweeted: ""Blaming 'both sides' for #Charlottesville?! No. Back to relativism when dealing with KKK, Nazi sympathizers, white supremacists? Just no."" Another Republican, Rep. Charlie Dent from Pennsylvania, said Trump ""must stop the moral equivalency! AGAIN."" Over the weekend, Trump faced heavy criticism from both Republicans and Democrats for chiding ""many sides"" for their role in the violence in Charlottesville on Saturday, a statement many regarded as tepid toward racists. A full two days later, on Monday, Trump at the White House directly condemned the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists and announced the Justice Department would open up a civil rights investigation into the driver of the car that killed Charlottesville resident Heather Heyer. Yet on Tuesday, amid questions about whether Trump meant the words behind his most recent scripted statement, the president called his initial response ""fine"" and blamed the press for being dishonest in its coverage. ""There was no way of making a correct statement that early,"" he said at one point. ""I had to see the facts. Unlike a lot of reporters – I didn't know (prominent white supremacist) David Duke was there. I wanted to see the facts."" For his part, former KKK leader Duke tweeted a thank you to the president after his statement Tuesday – for condemning ""the leftist terrorists"" in Black Lives Matter and Antifa.","President Trump, speaking from Trump Tower in New York City, stated that he held both the protesters and counter-protesters responsible for the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. His comments drew criticism from members of his own party and raised concerns about his stance on racial tensions in the country. Trump defended his initial response, claiming he needed to gather all the facts before making a statement, and blamed the press for being dishonest in its coverage. He also questioned the removal of Confederate statues and monuments, expressing concern that tributes to historical figures like George Washington and Thomas Jefferson would be targeted next."

The internet has been living for the pop diva as of late since she “stole” Meryl Streep’s at the Golden Globes and singlehandedly cancelled brunch forever with a single tweet, but it’s her meme-inducing moment (the first of 2018) from her New Year’s Eve performance that has Mimi hocking merch.  In case you missed it, the pop singer pulled a *totally* MC move when she stopped in the middle of her set to request a cup of hot tea.  “I’m just gonna take a sip of tea if you’ll let me,” she said. “They told me there would be tea. Ugh. It’s a disaster — okay. Well, we’ll just have to rough it. I’m gonna be just like everybody else with NO hot tea — but we’re gonna try and do this one for you, because I just want to show my appreciation for everyone who speaks out for justice, and tries to make the world a better place.”  Twitter was overjoyed by the request, taking to their social media pages with plenty of LOL-inducing memes that even the “I Don’t” singer herself got in on, joking, “Found my tea!” with a shot of herself sipping the hot beverage.  Now, the Queen has taken things one step farther, releasing her own line of “tea” shirts (plus a commemorative mug) to mark the momentous occasion, and yes, you’re going to want one.  Check out her hilarious collection below, and head over to the star’s official store, MariahPride.com to snatch one up while you can!  1. #FOUNDMYTEA Tee ($30): Because we *all* should look this glamorous while sipping our favorite hot drinks.  2.

gossipcop-3308884181,1,0,"Beyoncé Rumored To Be Asking For Silent Delivery  As the countdown to Blueprint 1 and Blueprint 2’s arrival continues, the stories about Bey’s birth plans abound. First, we heard she planned to give birth at home, then they said her security has been running weekly drills to practice their approach to Cedars-Sinai and now there’s a report that Bey wants silence in the delivery room.  According to Naughty Gossip reports:  “Beyoncé likes peace and calm around her. She has zero time for drama and gossip. She likes her inner circle to be soft spoken if they have to talk at all. And you can expect the same will be true when she gives birth to the twins,” sources tell Straight Shuter. “You can only get into her private life if you are invited. She is very guarded and protects her privacy at all cost. She likes to be surrounded with peaceful colors and soft sounds. This will be of utmost importance for her when giving birth.”  This story is almost like opening up a fortune cookie or visiting your average storefront psychic. EVERYBODY knows Beyoncé is private. THAT doesn’t take an exclusive source to figure out.  Silent birth is a real thing though – something that Scientologists practice and Katie Holmes even did when she gave birth to Suri, but as much as Bey loves music we don’t really see her doing a silent birth.  Speaking of Bey’s love of music… Hit the flip for some recently posted pics of her from a Michael Jackson/Prince party.  GettyImages/Instagram","Reports suggest that Beyoncé is rumored to be requesting a silent delivery for the arrival of her twins. The singer, known for her desire for peace and privacy, wants a calm and drama-free environment during childbirth. Beyoncé values her inner circle being soft-spoken and prefers a serene atmosphere. This is consistent with her protective nature, as she only allows those she invites into her private life. It is important to her to be surrounded by peaceful colors and gentle sounds during the birth. While it is well-known that Beyoncé is a private person, the idea of a silent birth is reminiscent of the practice followed by Scientologists and even Katie Holmes when she gave birth to her daughter, Suri. However, considering Beyoncé's love for music, it is unlikely that she will opt for complete silence. On a different note, some recently posted pictures show Beyoncé attending a Michael Jackson/Prince party."
gossipcop-8664328328,1,0,"Caitlyn Jenner is planning to take it all off for a nude photo shoot, DailyMail.com can disclose.  Jenner, 67, completed gender reassignment surgery in January, according to her new memoir, ‘The Secrets of My Life’. The photo shoot promises to be Caitlyn's finest hour since she first announced her transition in an interview with ABC’s Diane Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July.  Although the Kardashian-Jenner clan is said to be ‘wholly supportive’ of Jenner’s transition, sources close to the family say the prospect of a nude shoot is ‘their worst nightmare’.  Caitlyn Jenner, 67, completed gender reassignment surgery in January, according her memoir, ‘The Secrets of My Life’. The photo shoot promises to be Caitlyn's finest hour since she first announced her transition in an interview with ABC’s Diane Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July  Although the Kardashian-Jenner clan is said to be ‘wholly supportive’ of Jenner’s transition, sources close to the family say the prospect of a nude shoot is ‘their worst nightmare’  An insider tells DailyMail.com that the Kardashians learned of the 67-year-old’s plan from her model son Brody, 33.  ‘Brody told them that Caitlyn has planned and booked a full nude photo shoot and they were like, that’s unacceptable, it’s taking things too far,' the source said.  ‘They’re hoping the shoot doesn't come to pass because that would be their worst nightmare. Taking it to that level and unveiling her [new body] with a fully naked photo spread is going way too far.'  Kardashian momager Kris, who is said to have known about Jenner’s surgery in advance, has vowed to stop the shoot from going ahead, according to the insider.  ‘She knew the surgery was inevitable and it was bound to happen,’ said the source. ‘But she says she will do everything in her power to stop the shoot if she can.'  DailyMail.com has approached representatives for Jenner and the Kardashians for comment. Jenner's rep knew nothing about it.  Jenner first announced her transition in an interview with Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July.  The headline-making ‘I am Cait’ shoot was said to have taken the Kardashian clan by surprise at the time and led to tension between Jenner and Kim, 36, as a result.  Nevertheless, the family have been publicly supportive of her decision to transition, which was completed in January according leaked extracts from her memoir.  Jenner wrote of the $20,000 operation: 'The surgery was a success, and I feel not only wonderful but liberated […] I am going to live authentically for the first time in my life.  ‘I am going to have an enthusiasm for life that I have not had in 39 years since the Olympics, almost two thirds of my life.'  But the book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife and step-children.  Sources close to the family told DailyMail.com that Jenner’s ‘unpredictable’ behavior has also played a part in their current estrangement.  The insider said: ‘[The book] is definitely something that she’s wanted to do for a while and it was just a matter of time before she got it done.  ‘But the family were like, it’s probably going to reopen the drama of everything [that has happened].  ‘They were worried because she’s been so unpredictable lately and just trying to get out into the limelight.’  Jenner's book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife  A second leaked extract from the memoir has already proven embarrassing, after Jenner claimed the late Robert Kardashian knew O.J. Simpson was guilty of the murder of his wife Nicole Brown and her friend Ron Goldman.  Kardashian, the father of Kourtney, Khloe, Kim and their brother Rob, was part of Simpson’s defense team during his 1","Caitlyn Jenner is reportedly planning a nude photo shoot, which will be her biggest moment since publicly transitioning in 2015. While the Kardashian-Jenner family supports Jenner's transition, they are not in favor of the nude shoot. Jenner's son Brody informed the family about her plans, causing concern and disagreement. Kris Jenner, the family matriarch, is determined to prevent the shoot from happening. Representatives for Jenner and the Kardashians have been contacted for comment. Jenner's transition announcement and Vanity Fair photoshoot had caused tension within the family, particularly between Jenner and Kim Kardashian. Despite any family disagreements, Jenner's memoir reveals that the transition surgery was successful, and she feels liberated. However, the book has strained Jenner's relationship with her ex-wife and step-children, partly due to her unpredictable behavior. The book also includes controversial claims, such as stating that the late Robert Kardashian knew O.J. Simpson was guilty."
gossipcop-6742180407,1,0,"It was a humid 84 degrees in Bridgehampton on Saturday, but that didn’t stop a crowd of people from descending upon Topping Rose House for Jill Zarin’s annual luncheon. The former Real Housewife of New York, ran around the grounds in an A-line Carolina Herrera dress, posing on the step-and-repeat, taking photos with fans, and catching up with old friends. Trying to track her down for an interview turned into a scavenger hunt.  Scattered around the lawn were tables for vendors selling everything from wine to sex toys. There was a station for guests to get a vitamin infusion, with seats in the direct line of the sun transforming the spot into an inescapable sauna-I.V. drip hybrid. Housewives from across the country flew into town for the occasion (Vicki Gunvalson of Orange County and LeeAnne Locken of Dallas), which also served as a benefit for Thyroid Cancer Research in honor of Zarin’s late husband, Bobby, who died of the disease in January.  Upon first try to flag Zarin down for a couple of questions, she sent over her daughter, Ally Shapiro, in her stead. Shapiro reflected on last year’s luncheon, when her stepfather was still struggling with cancer, but encouraged her and her mother to party on.  “He loved drinking and partying. This was the highlight of his year,” she said. “It was this time last year that we were told he wasn’t gonna make it another week, and he pushed us and he said, ‘Go to the party. Maybe I won’t be here when you come back, but go.’”  Shapiro, who now lives in London while she works on her master’s degree, admits that she can’t watch old episodes of Real Housewives, which showed her as 14-year-old struggling to get close to her stepfather. “You want to think that it’s like a home movie, but it’s not. That’s not what our relationship was like,” she said, adding that the reruns play constantly in the U.K. “I’m walking down the street and someone’s like, ‘Oh my God, I just saw you trying on a prom dress!’”  She also said that her mother is dabbling with dating, specifically with a man she plays tennis with. “It’s fun, and I live in London so it’s good for her to have a distraction.”  Dina Lohan, dressed in a metallic green blazer and shorts set and a pair of oversized aviators, arrived fashionably late to the affair, but was immediately greeted by hoards of people trying to chat her up or get a photo. Eventually secured in the same spot for more than a few seconds, she was willing to talk about her daughter Lindsay’s upcoming project for MTV, a Vanderpump Rules–inspired reality show that follows Lindsay and the employees of her new Lohan Beach Club. Bunim/Murray Productions is producing the series, the same company that produced Lohan’s E! reality show Living Lohan a decade ago.  “These kids were like, babies, and now they’re running the show,” she said of the crew. “They lived in my house! And now they’re all corporate. . . . We’re home. It’s cyclical, you know.”  Lohan also revealed that the upcoming series is a bit of a family affair with Lindsay’s younger sister, 24-year-old Ali, providing the theme song.  A friend of Lohan’s interjected, asking if Ali, like her older sister over a decade ago, had moved out to L.A. for work.  “She’s in New York with me,” the matriarch answered. “I keep them close! I’m not going to lose someone to L.A., no. Not again!”  Finally, the woman of the hour managed to stop and take a breath. While Zarin may no longer be a Bravo housewife, she still knows how to schmooze like one. She’s been keeping up with the latest season of the show here and there, and even received a good-luck message from Luann de Lesseps, who checked into rehab earlier in the month, wishing her good luck on the event. Having brought me up to speed, Zarin closed our conversation with a plug for her new line of “pet-proof, gorgeous, and inexpensive” rugs, aptly titled Jill Zarin Rugs. Because once a housewife, always a housewife.  Get Vanity Fair’s Cocktail Hour Our essential brief on culture, the news, a","In Bridgehampton on Saturday, despite the hot and humid weather, a large group of people gathered at Topping Rose House for Jill Zarin's annual luncheon. Jill, the former Real Housewife of New York, was seen wearing an A-line Carolina Herrera dress, mingling with fans, taking photos, and catching up with old friends. Trying to get an interview with her turned into a scavenger hunt as she was constantly on the move. Throughout the event, there were various vendors selling products, including wine and sex toys. Guests also had the opportunity to receive a vitamin infusion while sitting under the sun, creating a sauna-like experience. Housewives from different parts of the country, such as Vicki Gunvalson of Orange County and LeeAnne Locken of Dallas, flew in to attend the luncheon, which also served as a fundraiser for Thyroid Cancer Research in memory of Jill's late husband, Bobby. When initially approached for an interview, Jill sent her daughter, Ally Shapiro, in her place. Ally shared her thoughts on last year's luncheon when her stepfather was battling cancer. She mentioned that despite the difficult circumstances, he encouraged them to enjoy the event. Ally, who now lives in London, admitted that she finds it challenging to watch old episodes of Real Housewives due to the portrayal of her struggling to connect with her stepfather. She shared how strangers in the UK recognize her from the show. Ally also mentioned that her mother has been casually dating a man she plays tennis with, which has been a positive distraction for her since she lives in London. Dina Lohan, dressed in a metallic green blazer and shorts set, arrived fashionably late and was immediately surrounded by people wanting to chat or take pictures with her. Eventually, she settled down and spoke about her daughter Lindsay's upcoming reality show for MTV, which is inspired by Vanderpump Rules and follows Lindsay and the employees of her new Lohan Beach Club. Dina mentioned that the show is being produced by the same company that worked on Lindsay's E! reality show from a decade ago. She also revealed that Lindsay's younger sister, Ali, has contributed to the show by providing the theme song. During the conversation, a friend of Dina asked if Ali, like Lindsay, had moved to L.A. for work, to which Dina firmly responded that Ali is in New York with her and she intends to keep her daughters close. Finally, Jill Zarin took a moment to pause and breathe. Although she is no longer a part of Bravo's Real Housewives, she still possesses the skills of schmoozing like a housewife. Jill mentioned that she has been keeping up with the latest season of the show and received a message of support from Luann de Lesseps, who recently entered rehab. Jill concluded our conversation by promoting her new line of rugs, called Jill Zarin Rugs, which are designed to be pet-proof, beautiful, and affordable."
gossipcop-7384566778,1,0,"Kylie Jenner may have skipped out on the 2017 Kardashian Christmas card, but she did attend mom Kris Jenner’s annual Christmas Eve party in Los Angeles.  The 20-year-old cosmetics guru — who is expecting her first child, a baby girl, with boyfriend Travis Scott — did not appear in any photos from the bash shared to social media by KarJenner family members. But a source tells PEOPLE she was there celebrating away from the cameras.  “Kylie looked great but didn’t really draw any attention to her baby bump,” the source says. “She still acts like she wants to keep her pregnancy private.”  Meanwhile, her sister Khloé Kardashian, — who earlier this week confirmed that she and boyfriend Tristan Thompson are expecting their first child together — accentuated her own baby bump in a skin-tight, sparkly jumpsuit with a white fur coat.  “Khloé was beaming all night,” the insider says of the 33-year-old Revenge Body host. “She kept touching and showing off her cute baby belly.”  Khloé showed off her bump on Instagram as well.  “Merry Christmas!! May you sparkle and shine this festive season, may all of your wishes and dreams come true,” Khloé captioned a gallery of shots showing her touching her belly. “I pray that we all may feel this happiness all year round. God bless you! ✨ #BabyBump🤗”  “Merry Christmas!!!!! Wishing all of you and your families much Joy Happiness Peace and Health…” Kris added in her own post, a photo of her and Khloé alongside Kendall Jenner. “Love you guys!!!!!!!! #christmas #blessed #ohholynight.”  Kim Kardashian West, Kris Jenner and Khloé Kardashian Khloe Kardashian/Instagram  Khloé Kardashian and Scott Disic Khloe Kardashian/Instagram  Aside for Khloé and Kendall, Kris’ party also brought together siblings Kim Kardashian West (who’s expecting her third child, via a surrogate), Kourtney Kardashian, and their kids: Kim’s daughter North, 4, and son Saint, 2; and Kourtney son Reign, 3, daughter Penelope, 5, and son Mason, 8.  Kourtney’s ex-boyfriend Scott Disick was there, too — without girlfriend Sofia Richie.  “He mingled, looked good and didn’t drink,” the source says, adding that there wasn’t any awkwardness with Kourtney’s new boyfriend Younes Bendjima.  “Kourtney seemed so happy that Younes joined her,” the insider says. “They are so cute together. He kept bringing her drinks and doting on her. Younes fits right into the family. He didn’t seem uncomfortable that Scott was there. They said hello, but that was it. It was very civil.”  Other guests included Kim’s husband Kanye West, celebrity hair stylists Jen Atkin and Chris Appleton, singer Christina Aguilera and Keeping Up with the Kardashians executive producer Ryan Seacrest. Kris appeared to be in a good mood throughout the night, dancing with Kim and Khloé and playing MC while Babyface, Toni Braxton and Brian McKnight performed.  “Everyone had the most amazing time,” the source tells PEOPLE. “Kris always throws the best parties. It was all gorgeous. There was no drama.”  Rob Kardashian and Khloé Kardashian Khloe Kardashian/Instagram  Kylie Jenner and Khloé Kardashian Khloe Kardashian/Instagram  On Christmas morning, the family gathered at Kourtney’s house to open presents and celebrate the holiday in matching elf-patterned onesies and beanies.  “Merry Christmas!

Two of Robert Kardashian's ex-wives have come forward saying he confided in them that he was unsure of the paternity of the now-27-year-old.  Jan Ashley, who married the businessman after Khloe's mother Kris Jenner, said: 'Khloe is not his kid -- he told me that after we got married.'  And Ellen Pierson, 63, who married Robert in 2003 just two months before his death, has also come forward after eight years of silence to 'tell the truth' about the Kardashian family.  Claims: Two of Robert Kardashian's ex-wives have come forward claiming the lawyer told them Khloe Kardashian, left, was not his real daughter, like older sisters Kim and Kourtney  The reality star has hit back at the claims, calling them 'really low'.  In an explosive interview with Star magazine, Ashley said: 'He just kind of looked at me and said [it] like it was a matter of fact. He said ""Well, you know that Khloe's not really a Kardashian, don't you?""    'And I said… ""OK"" and that was it.'  She claims Khloe, who is married to Dallas Mavericks basketballer Lamar Odom, knew she had a different father to her sisters and younger brother Rob.  'Khloe brought it up all the time. She looked nothing like the rest. She was tall, had a different shape, light hair, curly hair. Didn't look anything like the other three children.'  Different: Khloe has often pointed out that she looks nothing like her older sisters and their mother Kris, far right, said once people asked whether she was 'the milkman's child'  Fighting back: Khloe has responded to the claims today on Twitter She said Robert, who is of Armenian descent, had told her that he and Kris were not sleeping together at the time Khloe was conceived. '[But] he never would have considered a DNA test. He loved her very much. Robert did question the fact that Khloe was his,' Ellen said. 'Any normal man would if they knew their wife had cheated on him.' Khloe has responded to the claims today on Twitter.  Daddy's little girl: Robert Kardashian, pictured with Khloe as a child, referred to having four biological children in court documents filed in 1999 She wrote: 'The audacity you have to mention my father’s name like this! Should be ashamed of urself! I let a lot of things slide but this one is really low… YOU ARE DISGUSTING! (yes you know who YOU are).'    High-profile: Robert represented O.J. Simpson in his murder trial in 1994  Kris, 56, recently admitted in her new book that she cheated on Robert during their marriage.  Since Robert's death, Ellen had experienced financial difficulties, filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2010.  The home she and Robert shared in Indian Wells, California, was sold after going into foreclosure in October.  Kris remarried Olympian Bruce Jenner in 1991 and the couple had two daughters, Kendall and Kylie.  Bruce already had four children from two previous marriages: Burt, Casey, Brody, and Brandon.    Khloe is often talking about how she looks nothing like her sisters, and Kris has been quoted as saying people asked her whether she was 'the milkman's daughter' when she was born.    On Khloe's blog in June 2010, she shared a number of pictures of her and the attorney.  She wrote: 'Father’s Day is two days away, so in preparation I wanted to post this photo album (mostly old school pics) dedicated to my dad and to Bruce.  'I was seriously the luckiest girl in the world growing up because I had two amazing dads who not only loved us kids more than anything, but adored each other as well.  'My dad and Bruce were always really cl","Khloe Kardashian, the youngest sister of the Kardashian family, is facing allegations from two of her father's ex-wives who claim that he expressed doubts about her paternity. The ex-wives, Jan Ashley and Ellen Pierson, say that Robert Kardashian confided in them that Khloe was not his child. Khloe has responded to these claims on Twitter, calling them ""disgusting"" and ""low"". Kim Kardashian and her family have been surrounded by drama as a result of these allegations. Ashley and Pierson have both come forward to share their side of the story after years of silence. Ashley stated that Robert told her Khloe was not his child shortly after they got married. Pierson also claims that Robert expressed uncertainty about Khloe's paternity. Khloe, who is married to Lamar Odom, has reportedly known about this for a long time and frequently brought it up. She has pointed out that she looks different from her sisters and Rob Kardashian. Both Ashley and Pierson suggest that Robert and Kris were not sleeping together at the time Khloe was conceived. However, they state that Robert never considered a DNA test because he loved Khloe very much. Khloe has strongly rejected these claims on Twitter. Kris recently admitted to cheating on Robert during their marriage. After Robert's death, Ellen faced financial difficulties and filed for bankruptcy. The home she shared with Robert was sold due to foreclosure. Kris went on to marry Bruce Jenner and they had two daughters together. Khloe has always acknowledged that she looks different from her sisters, and Kris has mentioned in the past that people questioned whether Khloe was the milkman's daughter when she was born. Khloe has previously shared pictures and memories of her relationship with her father on her blog. She emphasizes that she was lucky to have had two loving dads in her life."

gossipcop-5865271192,1,0,"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired. T","Katie Holmes, known for her role in ""Dawson's Creek,"" is facing a series of rumors surrounding her relationships with Jamie Foxx, Tom Cruise, and her daughter Suri. According to RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were planning an expensive wedding that would make their relationship more public after five years of secrecy. However, Holmes discovered that Foxx was not ready to give up his flirtatious behavior and his connection with his ex-girlfriend Kristin Grannis. This led Holmes to call off the wedding and end their relationship. At the same time, Tom Cruise has been trying to reconnect with their daughter Suri, whom he hasn't seen for more than five years due to the restrictions imposed by his involvement with the Church of Scientology. Holmes agreed to keep quiet about Cruise and Scientology in exchange for him staying away from their daughter. However, she is torn between wanting her daughter to have a relationship with her father and not wanting her to be influenced by Scientology. Holmes' representative denied the breakup rumors and the possibility of a Cruise and Suri reunion, but this denial is significant as it is the first official acknowledgment of Holmes and Foxx's relationship. Their relationship had been kept secret due to legal obligations from Holmes' divorce settlement with Cruise. However, in 2017, they were photographed together, leading to speculation that the public dating ban had expired."

For the novel, see Thirteen Reasons Why 13 Reasons Why (stylized onscreen as TH1RTEEN R3ASONS WHY) is an American teen drama web television series developed for Netflix by Brian Yorkey, based on the 2007 novel Thirteen Reasons Why by Jay Asher. The series revolves around seventeen year old high school student, Clay Jensen, and his deceased female friend Hannah Baker, who has committed suicide after failing to cope with the culture, gossip and lack of support from her friends and her school. A box of cassette tapes recorded by Hannah in the lead up to her suicide detail thirteen reasons why she ended her life. The series is produced by July Moon Productions, Kicked to the Curb Productions, Anonymous Content and Paramount Television, with Yorkey and Diana Son serving as showrunners. Dylan Minnette stars as Clay, while Katherine Langford plays Hannah. Christian Navarro, Alisha Boe, Brandon Flynn, Justin Prentice, Miles Heizer, Ross Butler, Devin Druid, Amy Hargreaves, Derek Luke, Kate Walsh, and Brian d'Arcy James also star. A film from Universal Pictures based on Thirteen Reasons Why began development in February 2011, with Selena Gomez set to star as Hannah, before being shelved in favor of a television series and Netflix ordering the show straight to series in October 2015, with Gomez instead serving as an executive producer. The first season was released on Netflix on March 31, 2017. It received positive reviews from critics and audiences, who praised its subject matter and acting, particularly the performances of Minnette and Langford. For her performance, Langford received a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress in a Drama Series. However, its graphic depiction of issues such as suicide and rape, along with other mature content prompted concerns from mental health professionals. In response, Netflix added a warning card and from March 2018, a video that plays at the start of each season warning viewers about its themes.[2] In May 2017, Netflix renewed 13 Reasons Why for a second season; filming began the next month and concluded that December. The second season was released on May 18, 2018, and received negative reviews from critics and mixed reviews from audiences. A third season was ordered in June 2018 and is set to be released in 2019. Critical and audience reaction to the series has been divided, with the program generating controversy between audiences and industry reviewers. Premise [ edit ] In season one, seventeen year old Clay Jensen returns home from school one day to find a mysterious box on his porch. Inside he discovers seven cassette tapes recorded by Hannah Baker, his deceased classmate and unrequited love, who committed suicide two weeks earlier. On the tapes, Hannah unfolds an intensely emotional audio diary, detailing why she decided to end her life. It appears each person who receives this package of old-style tapes is fundamentally related to why she killed herself. Clay is not the first to receive the tapes, but there is implied detail as to how he should pass the tapes on after hearing them. There appears to be an order to distribution of the tapes, with an additional copy held by an overseer should the plan go awry. Each tape recording refers to a different person involved in Hannah's life contributing to a reason for her suicide. The tapes refer to both friends and enemies. In season two, months after Hannah's suicide, Clay and the other people mentioned on the tapes, as well as close friends and Hannah's family members, become embroiled in a civil legal battle between Hannah's parents and Liberty High School. Alleging negligence on the part of the school, Hannah's mother pursues her perception of justice, while her reluctance to settle pre-trial and her personal circumstances eventually break up her marriage with Hannah's father. The story unfolds with narratives illustrating Hannah's story told by those who present in court at trial.

Selena Gomez, 25, is seriously wishing Charlie Puth, 26, didn’t divulge their former relationship. A source close to Selena EXCLUSIVELY gave us the deets about how Selena reacted to Charlie’s confirmation that they dated. “Selena wishes Charlie would have kept his mouth shut about what they had because she is definitely interested in keeping that kind of stuff and her dating life as much under wraps as possible,” our source said. It’s clear that when it comes to who she dates, Selena apparently is all about maintaining her privacy.  According to our source, it’s only a matter of time before Selena responds to Charlie’s bombshell admission that they were briefly an item — and that Justin Bieber, 23, may have caused the two to go their separate ways. “Now, she will definitely have to respond down the line, and it’s just frustrating when people add their dirty laundry to a situation,” our source added. “She’s learned from the first time dating Justin and The Weeknd that less is more, which explains her relationship with Justin now being much more under the radar.” We reported earlier how Selena and Justin put to rest rumors that they had split by reuniting at one of his hockey games.

Pregnant Kylie Jenner. Pregnant Kylie Jenner. Yet — Kylie Jenner, 20, has not actually confirmed she is pregnant.  For some celebrities, this would not be a big deal — some stars get pregnant and do not say a word, even as “sources” and “insiders” dish to the tabloids, as illustrated above. For someone in the Kardashian-Jenner family, this is especially confusing.  After all, these family members have become international superstars because they share nearly every detail of their lives, even the painful or uncomfortable moments. As a result, people have become inexplicably fascinated by all of them (Kris Jenner, Caitlyn Jenner, Kim Kardashian West, Kourtney Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian and Rob Kardashian), which has fueled their multimillion-dollar franchise of reality shows and sponsorships.  So the decision to keep Kylie’s apparent pregnancy under wraps is very off-brand for the family. This month, speculation will probably hit even more of a fever pitch, as February is the oft-reported due date for her baby, reportedly a girl.  The non-confirmation of the news — reported by the tabloids in September and described as a “happy” surprise for Kylie and her boyfriend, rapper Travis Scott — has sent some fans into a spiral. On Christmas Day, fans melted down when Kylie did not appear on the family’s annual Christmas card.

The tabloid is reporting that a source is saying that Taylor is the one reaching out to the actor since she feels she is now more mature than she was when they dated back in 2010.  The source said, “Taylor was so young when they dated, she wasn’t ready for a serious relationship, but now she’s showing Jake how much she’s matured. She’s excited to see where things go.”  In 2015, a rumor swirled around saying that the stars were in contact with each other, even though she was dating Calvin Harris at the time.  An unidentified source told Star magazine that, “He said he owed Taylor an apology for how things ended between them. In June, Jake ran into Cara Delevingne at The Graham Norton Show and asked for Taylor’s new number. They’ve kept in touch, albeit secretly, ever since.""  This would all be so ironic since Taylor allegedly wrote the hit song ""We Are Never Getting Back Together"" from her Red album about the relationship after her ex's friend asked her if they were giving their relationship a second chance.  “This guy walks in who is a friend of my ex’s and starts talking about how he’s heard we’re going to get back together.

But there’s no reason to believe we’ll learn more anytime soon. In July of 2016, Aniston wrote a pretty searing op-ed for HuffPost in which she scolded paparazzi that are constantly obsessed with whether she’s in love or having babies.  “For the record, I am not pregnant,” she wrote then. “What I am is fed up. I’m fed up with the sport-like scrutiny and body-shaming that occurs daily under the guise of ‘journalism,’ the ‘First Amendment,’ and ‘celebrity news.’”  O.K., so, Jennifer Aniston is happy.

gossipcop-2388806885,1,0,"R. Kelly’s time may have finally come. R. Kelly has been accused of sexual relationships with minors going back to 1994, when he married 15-year-old pop star Aaliyah. (The marriage was annulled.) In the 24 years since then, he has been sued multiple times for inappropriate sexual contact with a minor (he settled out of court every time), and he was eventually charged with creating child pornography. (A jury found him not guilty on the grounds that they could not conclusively identify the other figure in his infamous sex tape as a child.) Last summer, he was accused of creating an abusive “sex cult” of very young women, whom he allegedly isolates, brainwashes, and abuses physically and emotionally. Since the story broke, multiple women have added their own testimonies of abuse at R. Kelly’s hands. (Through a lawyer, Kelly denied all accusations, saying he would “work diligently and forcibly to pursue his accusers and clear his name.”) And in April, another woman accused Kelly of “knowingly and intentionally infecting her with an STD.” Her lawyers say they are currently preparing a federal civil lawsuit. Through a spokesperson, Kelly issued a statement to the Washington Post in which he “categorically denies all claims and allegations.” As man after man has fallen to the #MeToo reckoning, losing jobs and retiring from public life after being accused of sexual harassment and assault, there’s been a recurring whisper: What about R. Kelly? Despite decades of lawsuits and allegations, Kelly’s career has marched steadily on. Last year, he finished an arena tour with a few cancellations. This year, he’s touring with singer Charlie Wilson (some protests are planned). His music appeared in Pitch Perfect 3. At this year’s Coachella, rapper Vince Staples repeatedly referred to Kelly as a “child molester” in an interview with Complex, insisting, “He pees on people.” In our post-#MeToo, post-Time’s Up, post-Harvey Weinstein world, and given the sheer volume of allegations against Kelly, it seems reasonable to raise the question of why he continues to work as much as he does. But Staples’s interviewer only giggled nervously and protested, “We can’t ever talk about this guy. ... You’re about to get me fired from Coachella. It’s my first time here.” Later, Staples tweeted that “R. Kelly people is looking for me.” ladies and gentlemen, vince staples on r kelly pic.twitter.com/SmZdYu9PNJ — andy (@aboynamedandy) April 16, 2018 That stasis may be starting to change. Most of the claims against Kelly were reiterated in a recent BBC Three documentary, R Kelly: Sex, Girls & Videotapes. And over the past year, at least five members of Kelly’s inner circle have left him. His assistant, his accountant, his lawyer, and his rep have all said that they no longer work for him, although none of them have gone into detail about their departures and all have been supportive and complimentary toward Kelly in their statements. His longtime musical accompanist, DJ Phantom, was less circumspect about his decision to leave Kelly in December: “I didn’t know then what I know now,” he said. “He’s a shitbag.” In April, the Women of Color committee within Time’s Up threw its weight behind the #MuteRKelly campaign, calling for anyone currently profiting from Kelly and his music to drop him, including Spotify, Ticketmaster, and Kelly’s record label, RCA. Shortly thereafter, Spotify announced that it would no longer be promoting Kelly’s music, although his music would remain in their streaming catalog. It’s possible that these new developlments mean things are changing for Kelly, and that he’s about to face lasting consequences for those accusations. But if that’s the case, those consequences took more than two decades to reach him. There is a persistent vagueness to the way we talk about R. Kelly that makes it possible to forget exactly what he’s been accused of, how often he’s been accused, and how much proof there is against him. And most likely, that’s because his alleg","R. Kelly’s time may have finally come. For decades, he has faced multiple accusations of sexual relationships with minors, lawsuits for inappropriate sexual contact, and charges of creating child pornography. Last summer, he was accused of creating a manipulative and abusive ""sex cult"" of young women, and more women have since come forward with their own stories of abuse. Despite these allegations, Kelly's career has remained largely unaffected, with successful tours and appearances in popular films. However, recent developments such as the release of a documentary and the departure of key members from his inner circle, as well as the support of the Time's Up movement, suggest that he may finally face lasting consequences. However, it is important to acknowledge that the persistence of these accusations has largely been ignored by society, as his alleged victims are primarily young black women. This timeline aims to shed light on the numerous accusations against R. Kelly, highlighting the recurring pattern of targeting and abusing young women. The timeline begins with his marriage to underage singer Aaliyah in 1994, a marriage that was later annulled."

While being interviewed for Task & Purpose for his new movie “Patriots Day,” Wahlberg went after celebrities who “lined up to denounce Donald Trump is the months and weeks leading up to Election Day.”  “A lot of celebrities did, do, and shouldn’t,” he told the magazine. “You know, it just goes to show you that people aren’t listening to that anyways. They might buy your CD or watch your movie, but you don’t put food on their table. You don’t pay their bills.”  “A lot of Hollywood is living in a bubble,” Wahlberg continued. “They’re pretty out of touch with the common person, the everyday guy out there providing for their family.

And although I can navigate Hollywood and I love the business and the opportunities it’s afforded me, I also understand what it’s like not to have all that.”  Wahlberg’s point is well taken. What makes Hollywood liberals qualified to speak on politics? They should have respect for the President of the United States.  Do you agree?","Mark Wahlberg, who has made significant progress since his days with the Funky Bunch, has a significant message for celebrities who oppose Trump. During an interview with Task & Purpose for his new film ""Patriots Day,"" Wahlberg criticized celebrities who publicly denounced Donald Trump in the months leading up to the election. He believes that many celebrities should not have done so because it is evident that people do not pay much attention to their political opinions. While individuals may support their music or films, they do not rely on celebrities to provide for them financially. Wahlberg argues that a lot of Hollywood is disconnected from the realities of everyday life and the struggles of the average person trying to support their family. He, on the other hand, understands the real world as he comes from it and continues to live in it despite his success in Hollywood. While he appreciates the opportunities the industry has given him, he also understands what it is like to not have all the privileges that come with it. Wahlberg's perspective is valid, questioning the qualifications of Hollywood liberals to speak on politics and emphasizing the need for respect towards the President of the United States. The question is whether you agree with him."

Madonna was hit with a series of “uncomfortable questions” by a judge before she was granted permission to adopt her 4-year-old twin girls from Malawi, the presiding judge said in court documents obtained by The Associated Press on Wednesday, February 8.  “The petitioner is a professional performer and I guarded myself against the danger of her merely reciting a well-rehearsed speech by asking her some rather uncomfortable questions to which she gave very candid answers,” Judge Fiona Mwale said in her ruling, explaining her reasons for approving the adoption.  After pressing Madonna, 58, to explain her intentions in adding two more little ones to her brood of four, Judge Mwale said she was satisfied that the girls would be in good hands with the Material Girl.  “There is no doubt that the petitioner can offer the infants not only the best education money can buy, but also guidance with a high likelihood of ensuring that the two infants grow to be self-sufficient adults,” Judge Mwale said, adding that she is satisfied that Madonna “is motivated by her desire to offer a home, love, protection and guidance to the infants.”  In the court documents, Judge Mwale addressed prior controversies surrounding Madonna’s adoptions in Malawi. “In determining her motives, I questioned the petitioner at length about the impact of her decision which could be construed as robbing Malawi of its most precious resource, its children,” the judge wrote.  As previously reported, Madonna filed for adoption in High Court in Malawi on January 25 but tried to keep the process under wraps until a final decision was made. (The Queen of Pop issued a statement denying her adoption to Us Weekly that same day, claiming that she was in Malawi “to check on the children’s hospital in Blantyre.”) According to the AP, she has already raised $7.5 million for a pediatric surgery ward at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, which is set to open early next year.  Madonna previously adopted son David and daughter Mercy James, both 11, from Malawi in 2008 and 2009, respectively. She is also mom to daughter Lourdes, 20, whom she shares with ex Carlos Leon, and son Rocco, 16, whom she shares with ex-husband Guy Ritchie.  Madonna’s twin girls will retain their birth names as a part of an effort to preserve their identity as Malawian nationals, the court documents said, and their father was at the January 25 court hearing with Madonna. (The twins’ mother died within a week of childbirth due to health complications.)  On Wednesday, February 8, Madonna took to social media to share the happy news. “I can officially confirm I have completed the process of adopting twin sisters from Malawi and am overjoyed that they are now part of our family,” she captioned an image of herself walking between the two little girls. “I am deeply grateful to all those in Malawi who helped make this possible, and I ask the media please to respect our privacy during this transitional time. 🙏🏻 Thank you also to my friends, family and my very large team for all your support and Love!”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!

The insider tells OK! “Rob was basically a 24-hour pot smoker back in his Twilight days, but since his relationship with Twigs got serious he's scaled back on all his vices and hardly ever drinks or smokes around other people.”  If Robert drank due to being stressed with the fame of Twilight, we can only imagine what happened after those infamous photos of Kristen Stewart making out with her movie producer boss while they were still together did to him.  ""He's matured a lot and become this very serious young man,” adds the source. “Rob’s dismayed that Charlie [Hunnam] hasn’t given up his pot habit. He doesn’t want to hang out with him, or his other hard-partying friends like Tom Sturridge or Eddie Redmayne.”  But we haven’t heard anything negative about FKA Twigs since they started dating in 2014, so it sounds like having a low-profile and more mature partner is exactly what he needed to turn his life around!","In an interview with The Times, he confessed, ""I spent the entire time intoxicated.

gossipcop-3316804883,1,0,"Millions of people watched her get engaged to Chris Soules on national television last year, but when former Bachelor star Whitney Bischoff and her fiancé Ricky Angel were engaged on July 15, this proposal was decidedly more intimate.  “It was just perfect,” Bischoff tells PEOPLE. “I was completely shocked. Ricky got me good! I was so happy that I couldn’t quit smiling. My cheeks hurt!”  The 31-year-old fertility nurse met sales manager Angel on the dating app Bumble (“Ladies pick — finally it was my choice,” jokes Bischoff) last September; the couple moved in together in May.  “On our first date, we just clicked,” she says. “It was easy and that’s the way it should be.”  Still, Bischoff admits it was “nerve-wracking” to jump back into the dating scene after her painful split from Soules in 2015, nearly seven months after they were engaged. “I was still a little bit broken and trying to pick up the pieces. But from day one there was open communication with Ricky about what I had gone through. I think one of the reasons I fell in love so quickly is that I could say everything and know I was not being judged.”  Bischoff hasn’t spoken to Soules recently but says she wishes him well. “I hope that he meets someone, if he hasn’t already, just as great for him and Ricky is for me.”  Now, Bischoff still watches The Bachelor, but says she’s moved on from her own reality show past. “That journey was a big part of my life,” she says. “But since I’ve met Ricky, I really haven’t looked back.”  Busy with wedding plans (the couple are looking at a date next fall), Bischoff says she nonetheless has positive associations with the show. “It’s sad that it ended the way it had to end, but I was still looking for that perfect someone. I didn’t let my past close off my heart. Everything works out for a reason.”","Last year, Whitney Bischoff, a former star of the reality show The Bachelor, became engaged to Chris Soules in front of millions of viewers. However, when Bischoff recently became engaged to her current fiancé Ricky Angel on July 15, the proposal was much more private. Bischoff describes the moment as ""perfect"" and admits to being completely surprised by the proposal. The couple met on the dating app Bumble in September of last year and moved in together in May. Bischoff acknowledges that reentering the dating scene after her breakup with Soules in 2015 was nerve-wracking, but she found comfort in the open communication with Angel. She wishes Soules the best and hopes he finds happiness with someone else. While Bischoff still watches The Bachelor, she has moved on from her own reality show experience since meeting Angel. She is currently focused on planning her wedding with him, which is expected to take place next fall. Bischoff remains positive about her past and believes that everything happens for a reason."

Something as simple as a picture of Aniston with her hand on her stomach is proof enough for some tabloids that the actress is expecting a baby. Now, a new report claims that the Friends star has hired a surrogate, could there be any truth to the story?  In the new issue of Star, the tabloid features the headline, “Jen To Justin: I’ll Raise Our Baby Alone!” followed by a story that asserts Aniston wants to become a mom, and she will do it with or without her husband. The publication claims to have a source that reveals Aniston’s marriage is “on the rocks,” and she is planning to be a single mom.  ?…❤️✌️ A post shared by @justintheroux on Aug 5, 2017 at 4:23pm PDT  “Privately, she has told friends that she’s secretly gone ahead and hired a surrogate mother to carry her child to birth. And she’s vowed to raise the baby alone,” tells the insider.  But then the source says the actress is hoping to choose the right woman soon, completely contradicting the earlier quote, which is a huge red flag that something isn’t right with this claim.  But many think the tabloid story is completely false and contradictory quotes prove the story is garbage, questioning why the insider is sharing such private and secret information with a tabloid.  This is the same magazine that published a story earlier this year claiming Aniston herself was pregnant, but then didn’t mention that at all in its latest baby claims.  Aniston told Glamour magazine back in August that not only are the pregnancy tabloid stories guilty of body shaming, but they are also an invasion into a private matter between her and her husband. She said it is no one’s business whether or not she has a baby.  Jennifer Aniston went on to say that the subject of having a baby is a sensitive topic for her, and no one has the right to judge other people’s choices.

Critics argue that the tabloid's story is false, pointing out its inconsistent quotes and questioning why the insider would share such private information with a tabloid. This isn't the first time the magazine has made baby claims about Aniston, as earlier this year they reported that she was pregnant herself, although this was not mentioned in their latest article. Aniston has previously expressed her frustration with pregnancy tabloids, stating that they engage in body shaming and invade her privacy.

gossipcop-5840642713,1,0,"Sky high prices are reportedly keeping fans from buying tickets to Taylor Swift’s upcoming Reputation tour, per a story by the New York Post. Though her 1989 world tour boasted numerous sold out performances (it eventually became the highest grossing tour of 2015), it appears her considerably more expensive snake persona is a tougher sell.  Last month, her “longtime” tour promoter told Billboard, “By the time all the tickets are sold next week, I’ll be celebrating Taylor’s birthday with a cocktail in my hand and sold-out concerts all over the world.” But her birthday has come and gone, and not one date has sold out.  Reputation was the biggest-selling album of 2017 and the tour is shaping up to be far from ill-attended, so the Post’s headline, “Taylor Swift’s Reputation tour shaping up to be a disaster,” is a little much. It does, however, highlight the problems with unpredictable pricing, scalpers, and Ticketmaster in general.  The company’s “Verified Fan” program, which they would like you to believe is all about rewarding music lovers, appears to be nothing but a cash grab that takes advantage of Swift-obsessed teens with easy access to their parents’ credit card numbers. People willing to drop $50 on merch, the Post reports, could “improve [their] position in line to purchase tickets.” And, once accessible, the tickets are often too expensive for many fans.  “I paid $150 for my ticket with amazing seats for the 1989 tour,” one fan wrote. “Now for the same seats I have to pay about $500.”  Advertisement  In related news, tickets to Katy Perry’s Friday show in New Orleans are currently starting at $23.","According to a report by the New York Post, the high prices for tickets to Taylor Swift's upcoming Reputation tour are preventing fans from buying them. Even though her previous tour in 1989 had many sold-out performances and became the highest grossing tour of 2015, it seems that her more expensive snake persona is not as popular. Last month, her tour promoter mentioned that all tickets would be sold by Taylor's birthday, but none of the dates have sold out yet. While the Post's headline calling the tour a disaster may be exaggerated, it does highlight issues with pricing, scalpers, and Ticketmaster in general. Ticketmaster's ""Verified Fan"" program, which is supposed to reward music lovers, is seen as a way to take advantage of Swift-obsessed teenagers who have access to their parents' credit cards. The article also mentions that purchasing merchandise worth $50 could improve one's chances of getting better tickets, but even if accessible, the tickets are often too expensive for many fans. One fan mentioned that they had paid $150 for great seats during the 1989 tour, but now those same seats cost around $500.

(Buchanan County Sheriff via AP) Iowa farmer Chris Soules, a former star on ABC’s “The Bachelor” who charmed reality TV viewers with his small-town life, was arrested this week after police said he fled a crash that killed a fellow farmer. Soules, 35, was charged with leaving the scene of a fatal crash, a class D felony, and could face up to five years in prison if he is convicted. The case has garnered the attention of Soules’s “Bachelor” fans as well as residents of Arlington, Iowa, where he lives, who had come to appreciate the reality TV star’s work as an unofficial Iowa ambassador and farm industry advocate. “This story is going to spread like wildfire around here and probably all over because of who he is,” Mary Jo Brown, Arlington’s city clerk, told the Des Moines Register. “Sometimes fame isn’t your friend.” Soules, who also appeared in “Dancing with the Stars” and “Worst Chefs in America,” called 911 at 8:20 p.m. Monday evening to report that he had rear-ended a tractor on a rural road north of the tiny town of Aurora, about six miles away from his home. The tractor veered into a ditch after being struck by his 2008 Chevrolet Silverado, Soules said. The tractor driver — later identified as 66-year-old Kenneth Mosher, a Vietnam War veteran — was unconscious and not breathing, Soules told the 911 operator, according to audio obtained by local media. The man had a pulse, but there was blood around his mouth, Soules said. Soules identified himself on the call, which lasted nearly six minutes, and sounded frantic. Between heavy breathing, he answered the dispatcher’s questions and took instructions. Soules told the 911 operator he did not know how to perform CPR and could be heard asking unidentified people at the scene if they could perform the lifesaving measure. The call ended abruptly after the operator told Soules law enforcement and medical first responders were on the way. “Can I, can I call you back really quick?” Soules asked the dispatcher. “Yeah, you can call me back,” she says. “Thank you,” Soules responds. Soules left the crash site after emergency responders arrived, but before deputies with the Buchanan County Sheriff’s Office were on the scene, according to authorities. Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Scott Bright told the Des Moines Register that Soules fled the scene on foot and later got into a truck. In police audio obtained by local media, a deputy told a dispatcher that Soules “took off” in a red truck. Authorities are trying to identify who picked up Soules in the truck, Buchanan County Sheriff Bill Wolfgram told the Associated Press. That person could face charges, he said. Alcohol was found at the scene and investigators are trying to determine whose it was and whether it or speed were factors in the crash. Soules was arrested about five hours after the incident and booked into the Buchanan County Jail, the Associated Press reported. He posted a $10,000 bond Tuesday morning and was released on the condition that he surrender his passport and wear an electronic monitor. During his first appearance in court, the Buchanan County assistant attorney told the judge that Soules refused to cooperate with law enforcement after they located him at his home. He “would not come out,” the attorney said, until officials obtained a search warrant, which “took hours.” Chris Soules making his initial court appearance in Buchanan County @KWWL pic.twitter.com/72bvEg0wVR — Elizabeth Amanieh (@EAmaniehKWWL) April 25, 2017 Wolfgram told the Associated Press that investigators were “running into some roadblocks when it comes to getting information” but acknowledged Soules was acting within his constitutional rights.

Heidi, 44, looks like a fountain of youth but it obviously takes more of an effort than we knew. But her loved one are over her ramming her perfection down their throats.  Adds the insider, “What also really annoys people is how Heidi fakes being normal. She even pretends to eat junk food when the cameras are on her but she hasn’t actually swallowed a bite of a burger in years.”  Just last month, she and her boyfriend spent time in Italy, so we really have no idea how she avoided the pasta and pizza!  “All she talks about is working out and what she’s eaten that day – which is usually not much more than a handful of nuts and steamed kale.” That doesn’t sound like fun.","According to an exclusive source, it is revealed that Heidi's constant focus on her workout routine and avoidance of carbs has become tedious for everyone in her life, including her boyfriend Vito Schnabel. Despite looking youthful, her loved ones are tired of her constantly showcasing her perfection. Moreover, Heidi's attempts to appear normal, such as pretending to eat junk food on camera, are also annoying to people. Interestingly, she hasn't consumed a burger in years. Despite spending time in Italy recently, it remains unclear how she managed to avoid pasta and pizza. It seems that all Heidi talks about is her workouts and minimal food intake, which primarily consists of nuts and steamed kale. Overall, it doesn't sound enjoyable."

Up till tpo that moment Crazy Jo-lie had kept Brad far from Jen. Make no mistake about it. Her frantic traveling all over the place was an attempt at keeping Pitt away from her and and any other person who might think they were a friend. She can't stand anyone but her having anything to do with Pitt . Including his own family. I knew it would backfire one day. Brad what took so long????? She suffers from an extreme mental illness. She doesn't have the kids in school for the same reason.  I do believe she thought it would last. Seeing how sexy and pretty she thinks she is. A man should and would do anything she tells them to.  I am under the impression her treatment of her surrogate Holly had a sort of wake up call to Pitt as to how utterly evil she is. You can bet she dismissed her like a piece of shite. A woman who carried twins for her. Started making Brad see her game of using and abusing.  And when Jen said her and Brad talk all the time on the phone you know that was news to little miss do as I say not as I do Angelina still talks to her ex's Jo-LIE.    Guess all the years of trying to force Brad to believe Jen was a shallow no good woman has a way of catching up to one. It took this long for Pitt to see just what had truly happened. Her spells have lost the power to confuse.In Touch said she has a terrible jealous streak and can't stand Brad even looking at a woman SHE DEEMS ATTRACTIVE IN ANY WAY.

The National Enquirer  Says Brad is so happy to have a separation from her.Brad's closest friends are woman and that drives Angelina nuts she hates sharing him  He was mad she took the salt role because she had promised him she would stay at home and be a mom.  I mean you can see her doing whatever she damn well wanted to. And he went along with it. But they have twin babies and my guess is she spends very little time bonding with them. What woman would not want to be able to stay with her new little babies. Not this woman. Sick behavior for sure. And the only thing keeping Brad from making it final is the kids.  Angie be careful what you wish for. Seems like 6 kids are going to be without a mom and dad in one place. Good luck with that","According to a post from a guest on June 14, 2009 at 3:22 pm, things took a turn for the worse after Jen attended the Academy Awards show and smiled at Brad Pitt, causing Angelina Jolie to distance Brad from Jen. Angelina's constant traveling was an attempt to keep Brad away from anyone she perceived as a friend. She doesn't want anyone else to have a relationship with Brad, including his own family. The writer believes that Angelina's actions would eventually backfire and questions why it took Brad so long to realize her manipulative behavior. The writer suggests that Angelina suffers from a mental illness and doesn't have their children in school for similar reasons. They think she believed her relationship with Brad would last because she considers herself attractive and thinks men should do as she says. The treatment of her surrogate, Holly, made Brad see Angelina's true nature. The writer also points out that Angelina still talks to her exes, despite expecting Brad not to communicate with Jen. Brad's friends being women bothers Angelina, and she broke her promise to stay home and be a mother by taking on a salt role. It is mentioned how little time Angelina spends bonding with their twin babies. The writer implies that the only reason Brad hasn't finalized a separation is because of the kids. Lastly, the writer warns Angelina to be careful, as it seems like their six children will end up without both parents in one place."
gossipcop-8342414455,1,0,"Forget Wills and Kate's dusty old Norfolk. The lovebirds want to hang out with the groovy set in the Cotswolds - and the local estate agents' eyes are lighting up. There comes a time in every couple's relationship when the question of moving in together becomes impossible to ignore. And when those two lovebirds have been stepping out for 15 months — even though they live 3,500 miles apart; he in the UK, she in Canada — it's not so much a case of 'if' as of 'when' they will settle down. So it comes as no surprise that Prince Harry, 33, and his actress girlfriend Meghan Markle, 36, are said to be house-hunting. £7.25million - North Aston Manor, Oxfordshire: This eight bedroom property, overlooking the stunning Cherwell Valley, has seven reception rooms, a spa, swimming pool and 18.2 acres with equestrian facilities. It's nine miles from Soho Farmhouse and swanky shopping centre Bicester Village, should Meghan fancy snapping up some designer bargains Prince Harry and actress girlfriend Meghan Markle were pictured together at the Invictus Games in Toronto last month Royal sources have exclusively told the Daily Mail that the royal couple are looking in Oxfordshire and are particularly interested in high-end properties tucked away in the rolling Cotswold hills. A good friend of Harry's says the Prince, whose father's residence, Highgrove House, is in the south Cotswolds, has a long-standing affection for the area, while Meghan is said to be entranced by its rustic charm. 'He is searching for a new home in the area,' the friend reveals. 'Before Meghan, he was vaguely looking in Norfolk, but didn't find what he wanted. Now, with her input, he's renewed his search.' £2million - The Old Rectory, Lower Brailes, Oxfordshire: A stunning wood-panelled property dating from the 14th century, this boasts eight bedrooms, a sun-drenched terrace and its own private lake, complete with duck house. There’s a three-bedroom coach house for guests and it’s set at the end of a no-through road. Certainly, the lush green countryside encompassing swathes of Warwickshire, Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire is a huge draw for London-dwellers eager to snap up rural boltholes. Just an hour or so from the capital, it's home (or at least a weekend retreat) to A-listers, politicians and media executives: the Camerons, Beckhams, Kate Moss, Lily Allen and Stella McCartney all have million-pound properties in the area. 'It's like a magnet,' says Sophie Gannon, of Savills Estate Agents in Banbury, Oxfordshire. 'If you get one person, you get them all.' However, Harry isn't following the crowd but listening to his heart. The Cotswolds, and specifically Highgrove, which was bought by his father's private estate in 1980, is where the Prince spent much of his childhood. It was Charles and Diana's weekend home, with 15-acre grounds and, later on, a teenage haven in the cellars of the main house, which Harry nicknamed 'Club H'. £2.95million - Fanthill, Banbury, Oxfordshire: Accessed through electric gates, up a winding driveway, this eight-bedroom house sits among 20 acres of land, so ticks all Harry’s boxes when it comes to privacy. There’s a heated outdoor pool, miniature golf course and a carp lake, where the young lovebirds could row off the private pier A local who knows the family says: 'It's not surprising that Harry would like to live where he feels at home. 'He's lived in the Cotswolds all his life and often returns to visit his father. After his mother died, it became a place of sanctuary. 'When the boys entered their teens, Charles bought several homes in the area, thinking they might want one in the future.' Ten years ago, Charles bought up properties adjacent to his sprawling estate, paying £2 million apiece for nearby manor houses and farm buildings. But sources say rather than living off his father's generosity, Harry wants to invest in a place of his own. £4.25million - Cross Hill House, Adderbury, Oxfordshire: This 10-bedroom house, surrounded by landscaped","Wills and Kate's outdated home in Norfolk is being forgotten as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle express their desire to live in the Cotswolds. The local estate agents are excited about the prospect. After being together for 15 months, it is inevitable that the couple will eventually move in together. Prince Harry, with Meghan's input, is now house-hunting in Oxfordshire and has a particular interest in high-end properties in the Cotswold hills. He has always had an affinity for the area due to his childhood spent there. They are specifically looking for properties that offer privacy and are drawn to the rustic charm of the Cotswolds. The Cotswolds is also popular among other celebrities and influential figures, making it a desirable location. Harry is not simply relying on his father's property and wants to invest in his own place. The couple's close friends and relatives already live in the Cotswolds, which has influenced their decision. They prefer this area over Norfolk, where William and Kate currently reside. Over the past few months, Harry has been seen exploring various locations in the Cotswolds without Meghan. Moving to the Cotswolds makes sense for practical reasons as well, given Harry's royal responsibilities and Meghan's career."

It’s no secret that Jennifer Lopez-at 48-has a body that won’t quit and skin that needs to be studied so we can all age like the goddess she is.  Dramatic? Not even close.  And while a lot of it may be down to great genes, Lopez has revealed in a new interview some of her beauty secrets and yep, they’re as diva as you might expect.  Lopez credits her glow to positive affirmations, revealing she says one in particular to herself every day to keep her radiant, youthful look intact.  So what is this magic phrase?  “I am youthful and timeless at every age,” Lopez says every single day—but it’s not enough to just say the mantra daily, because Lopez also has a handful of pillows with these words and more mantras embroidered into them all over her home. “I tell myself that every day, a few times a day. It sounds like clichéd bullshit, but it’s not: Age is all in your mind. Look at Jane Fonda.”  Lopez continues, “The affirmations are everywhere. I forget that they’re all here. They’re just part of the house now.”  Before you scoff at Lopez’s positivity there is a school of thought that believes negative thoughts can age you. Australian-born Dr Blackburn, a Nobel Prize winner, co-authored The Telomere Effect: A Revolutionary Approach to Living Younger, Healthier, Longer, with anti-aging psychologist Dr Elissa Epel, which investigated the link between telomeres, which protect our chromosomes, and the effect stress, sleep and diet can have on telomeres and how that directly corresponds with our health.  The book asserts there is a correlation between depression and anxiety and shorter telomeres and that “when pessimists develop an aging-related illness, like cancer or heart disease, the illness tends to progress faster.”  And really there's only so far a little highlight can go, step one is all about a positive attitude. Step two is to find yourself a great pillowcase and settle on your new mantra.  So what’s the lesson here? Your inner glow is only a glass half full attitude away.","Jenny, the owner of silk pillowcases, is known for her ageless beauty and stunning physique. She believes that her positive affirmations play a significant role in maintaining her radiant appearance. Every day, she repeats the mantra, ""I am youthful and timeless at every age,"" and even has pillows embroidered with similar affirmations throughout her home. While some may dismiss her positivity, scientific research suggests that negative thoughts can contribute to the aging process. Dr. Blackburn, a Nobel Prize winner, and Dr. Epel, an anti-aging psychologist, have explored the connection between telomeres, stress, sleep, diet, and overall health in their book, ""The Telomere Effect: A Revolutionary Approach to Living Younger, Healthier, Longer."" They argue that pessimism can accelerate the progression of aging-related illnesses. Therefore, maintaining a positive attitude is crucial for maintaining a youthful glow. Additionally, choosing a high-quality pillowcase and adopting a new mantra can also enhance one's well-being. Ultimately, the lesson here is that nurturing a positive mindset is the key to achieving inner radiance."

Each time Channing and Jenna head to mediation to discuss the terms of their divorce, “they can’t seem to agree on anything,” says a source. “Their meetings have been contentious.” One big issue: their five-year-old daughter, Everly. “They can’t agree on custody,” a friend tells In Touch exclusively.      Unicorns do exist. A post shared by Channing Tatum (@channingtatum) on May 4, 2018 at 6:40pm PDT      “They’re both working hard to do what’s in the best interest of their daughter, but it’s just taking way longer than they both expected because they can’t agree on the small details.” Another sticking point: Channing’s estimated $60 million fortune. Though Jenna, 37, has had a successful movie and TV career with shows like Supergirl, Channing, 38, has starred in several blockbusters, such as Magic Mike and 21 Jump Street, and was the family’s main breadwinner. “Jenna has told friends that she gave Channing the best years of her life,” says the source, “and now she’s trying to negotiate a very secure future for herself.”  There is a lot at stake financially. During the course of their marriage, the pair acquired several assets, including a $6 million Beverly Hills home and pricey cars including a Tesla and a vintage Chevrolet truck. Finding common ground about dividing their stuff “is not easy,” says the friend. “They both want it to be over with.”          Jenna never thought it would come to this. “She isn’t pleased about how it’s all played out so far,” says the source. “She’s bitter. There are days when she’s blaming him for not working harder to save their marriage.” And while she’s told pals that she hopes they can stay friends, adds the source, deep down “she knows that’s never going to happen.”  Channing shouldn’t underestimate Jenna, says the source: “She’s looking out for herself, and at the end of the day she knows that he’s got to pay. She’s not going to walk away quietly.”  For more on this, pick up the latest issue of In Touch — and for more exclusive content sign up for our newsletter.

Additionally, the division of their assets, which include a multimillion-dollar home and expensive cars, has proven to be challenging. Jenna had hoped for a different outcome and feels bitter about the situation, at times blaming Channing for not putting in more effort to save their marriage.

Fans believed he had taken the picture.  Cheryl - who is living at their £5.6million country home in Surrey - did not publicly respond to his message.  A source told MailOnline: 'Cheryl basically went into hibernation when she got pregnant and has made the decision to be a stay at home mother with no nanny and is looking after bear herself.

gossipcop-9639077061,1,0,"Ivanka Trump is becoming one of the most powerful first children in American History – despite not having an official job in the Trump administration. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) Ivanka Trump’s products weren’t always the hottest items online. In January, for instance, the first daughter’s fashion line ranked No. 550 based on the number of orders from Lyst, the biggest fashion e-commerce website in the world, according to Forbes. That changed dramatically the following month. Sales of Trump’s products skyrocketed in early February, making her Lyst’s 11th most popular brand. The biggest spike, according to Lyst, came on Feb. 9, when sales jumped by 219 percent from the day before. Yes, Feb. 9 — the same day that White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted Trump’s clothing and jewelry line on “Fox & Friends.” “Go buy Ivanka’s stuff is what I would tell you,” Conway said. “I’m going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody.” And viewers did, apparently. Sales of Ivanka Trump’s branded products skyrocketed on Feb. 9, the same day White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted the line on Fox News. (Lyst) Abigail Klem, president of the Ivanka Trump brand, said in a statement that “the beginning of February” shows “the best performing weeks in the history of the brand.” “For several different retailers, Ivanka Trump was a top performer online, and in some of the categories it was the best performance ever,” Klem said. Sarah Tanner, Lyst’s spokeswoman, said increases in sales are usually tied to current events. For instance, interest in pantsuits went up by 460 percent last year because of Hillary Clinton’s affinity for the style, she said. Sales of the first daughter’s products went up by 86 percent in November when her father won the presidential election, according to the company. Conway has come under fire for touting Ivanka Trump's clothing line during a televised interview. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) [A Trump wine boycott backfires spectacularly] But the brand was “largely featured” in the news in February, Tanner said. Conway gave her on-air endorsement of Ivanka Trump’s brand after President Trump had complained on Twitter that his daughter had “been treated so unfairly” by the department store Nordstrom, which dropped her clothing line over slow sales. “It would not be a surprise to us if it resulted in the increase in sales,” Tanner said of Conway’s Fox interview. “I think that’s one of the reasons the brand was largely in the news and could have attributed to this increase.” Conway did not respond to an email requesting comment. Her promotion of the fashion line appeared to violate an ethics rule barring federal employees from using their public office to endorse products and immediately drew criticism from both Democrats and Republicans. [Where does the Ivanka Trump brand go from here?] Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said Conway’s comments were “absolutely wrong, wrong, wrong” and “clearly over the line,” The Washington Post reported. The White House later said that Conway had been “counseled.” But concerns about her comments remain. On Thursday, the government’s top ethics official criticized the White House for not disciplining Conway, The Post’s Drew Harwell reported. Walter M. Shaub Jr., director of the Office of Government Ethics, had urged officials last month to reprimand the White House counsel but was rebuffed. On Thursday he wrote to Stefan C. Passantino, who handles White House ethics issues as the president’s deputy counsel. “When an employee’s conduct violates, disciplinary action serves to deter future misconduct,” Shaub wrote. “Not taking disciplinary action against a senior official under such circumstances risks undermining the ethics program.” [A Trump voter’s message to retailers: ‘Keep your mouths shut about our president’] Last month, a group of law professors filed a professional misconduct complaint against Conway — a","Ivanka Trump, despite not having an official position in her father's administration, has become one of the most influential first children in American history. Her fashion line, although initially lacking popularity, experienced a dramatic increase in sales in February. This surge in sales can be attributed to White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoting Trump's products on a televised interview. However, Conway's endorsement has been criticized for violating ethics rules. Concerns about her comments led to a complaint filed by law professors against Conway. Although sales for Ivanka Trump's brand have tapered off since February, they are still expected to be higher than January's sales. The brand has also managed to withstand the effects of a boycott campaign against Trump-branded products. Several retailers have distanced themselves from the brand, but others continue to stock the products."

gossipcop-2194660040,1,1,"First Lady Melania Trump claims there is a secret poisoner in the White House and fears her husband is being slowly poisoned with “heavy sedatives” smuggled into his drinks in an attempt to slow him down, control him, and discredit his presidency, according to reports.  While public debate rages about Donald Trump’s health, Melania has told friends and associates that the once robust and high energy man she knew and loved has been replaced with a “slower, damaged version”.  “By 8pm he is slurring,” she said. “This is not the man I know.”  Fearing that the sedatives are being pumped into the body of the POTUS via Coca-Cola that he orders by pressing a button he had installed on the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, Melania has insisted he stop drinking from the tap and instead revert to drinking from cans she brings herself.  “Donald’s heath improved out of sight when he stopped drinking from the tap,” Melania said.  However the First Lady fears the active campaign to poison the president is “a high level operation” and “not the work of a solitary loon.”  Melania is popular in the White House—as she is with the rest of the country—and she has befriended senior intelligence agency staff who remain loyal to president. They have educated her about Ronald Regan’s poisoning by the Deep State after his assassination attempt in 1981. They have also warned her that George W. Bush was reduced to a “brain damaged” state after years of steady poisoning.  But the advantage Trump may hold over his GOP predecessors in the Oval Office is that he has a wife who is wise to the ruse and is insisting he watch his food and drink intake closely for signs of adulteration.  Donald Trump’s food choices say a lot about the man. The president’s Howard Hughes-level pickiness when it comes to food is partly motivated by a desire to avoid being poisoned, according to Melania. He doesn’t trust those around him – and rightfully so.  As President Trump knows all too well, there are enemies of the state dug in deep at the White House.  Reporters from TIME recently got a glimpse behind-the-scenes at the White House, where they reported on what goes down at the president’s dinner table. Of particular interest was a meal enjoyed by the reporters, Trump, and Vice President Pence.  Pence’s meal was not unusual—he ate what everyone else did. But the POTUS received a meal fully customized to his own preferences, and closely observed by Melania who insisted on watching the chef prepare the meal with ingredients she provided herself.","First Lady Melania Trump has expressed concerns about a secret plot to poison President Donald Trump with sedatives, according to sources. She believes that someone is smuggling heavy sedatives into his drinks, causing him to appear slower and less energetic. Melania suspects that the sedatives may be hidden in the Coca-Cola ordered by the President, prompting her to bring cans of the drink herself for him to consume. She views this operation as being highly organized and not the work of an individual acting alone. Melania has been informed by senior intelligence agency staff about previous instances of poisoning of presidents, such as Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. She remains vigilant about Trump's food and drink intake, being aware of the potential threats posed by enemies within the White House. The President's cautiousness around food is attributed partly to his fear of being poisoned, as he has developed a lack of trust towards those around him."
gossipcop-9067064195,1,0,"Tom Cruise has seemingly been all about his movie career since his high-profile marriage to Katie Holmes met its demise. The action star has steadily starred in film after film, yet has been at the center of several dating rumors.  As the International Business Times reports, “The actor was mistakenly linked to an Australian journalist and then was associated to his Mission: Impossible 6 co-star and Crown actress Vanessa Kirby.”  All rumors until now have been stamped out as false.  However, the latest claims include those stating that members of the Church of Scientology have once again been playing matchmaker for the Top Gun star and that Cruise has reportedly been secretly dating over the past little while. Interestingly enough, Tom has reportedly been using a disguise to enjoy dates with the ladies, much like Katie Holmes did in the initial stages of her romance with Jamie Foxx.  A source told the publication about Cruise’s tactics to keep his love life out of the spotlight.  “Tom’s back on the dating scene, but nobody knows it’s him. His face is way too recognizable for him to stroll into the bars, so he has his makeup artist create a silicone mask. Seems like Tom took his Mission: Impossible role to heart. It’s just what Ethan Hunt would do in the movies.”  It’s also been claimed that the disguise, which includes makeup, takes a full five hours to apply. If this rumor all sounds a little far-fetched, that’s because it is completely untrue, according to Gossip Cop. Tom Cruise does not go through some elaborate process to secretly step out on dates. In fact, there has not been any confirmation that Tom Cruise has dated anyone since Katie Holmes.  Alberto E. Rodriguez / Getty Images  Katie Holmes, however, continues to attempt to keep her romance with Jamie Foxx a secret, despite the fact that the pair has been spotted on numerous occasions over the past year on beach getaways and romantic locales like Paris. Most recently the mysterious duo were spotted celebrating Jamie’s 50th birthday at a Santa Monica beach hotel last week, as Page Six relays.

The couple was also seen walking along the beach while Foxx had his arm around the beauty. This report is similar to the one earlier this year that stated Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx were spotted strolling along the beach hand-in-hand in Malibu.","After his high-profile marriage to Katie Holmes ended, Tom Cruise has been focused on his movie career.

She got the chance to showcase her talent in 1996, when she made her TV debut on Fox's TV series Party of Five (1994-2000).

However, it was in 1999 that she started to attract public attention when critics lauded her brilliant portrayal of Cindy in ""200 Cigarettes"", even though the movie itself was a commercial disappointment.

In the midst of a whirlwind schedule of fashion shoots and awards shows, she made an appearance in the romantic war drama The Four Feathers in 2002. Turning out to be a box-office failure, Hudson fired back with the surefire hit as she starred opposite quirky heartthrob Matthew McConaughey in the romantic comedy How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003). She continued to establish herself as a fully-fledged actress starring in subsequent productions like Raising Helen (2004), The Skeleton Key (2005), You, Me and Dupree (2006), Fool's Gold (2008) and Bride Wars (2009).

gossipcop-7885025406,1,0,"More than a month has passed since Matt Lauer was fired from the Today show, and his former longtime colleague, Katie Couric, is now opening up about the former NBC anchor’s shocking dismissal.  “The whole thing has been very painful for me,” Couric, 61, tells PEOPLE. “The accounts I’ve read and heard have been disturbing, distressing and disorienting and it’s completely unacceptable that any woman at the Today show experienced this kind of treatment.  “I had no idea this was going on during my tenure or after I left,” she continued. “I think I speak for many of my former colleagues when I say this was not the Matt we knew. Matt was a kind and generous colleague who treated me with respect. In fact, a joke I once made on late-night television was just that, because it was completely contrary to our brother-sister relationship. It’s still very upsetting. I really admire the way Savannah [Guthrie] and Hoda [Kotb] and the entire Today show staff have handled a very difficult situation.”  The late-night show joke that Couric refers to is when she said on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen in 2012 that Lauer “pinches me on the ass a lot.” A clip of the comment made the rounds online in the wake of Lauer’s firing.  Couric spent 15 years co-hosting NBC’s Today show with Lauer, 60, but left in May 2006 to anchor the CBS Evening News.  NBC/Getty  Lauer was fired at the end of November by NBC News after the network received a “detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior,” with reason to believe “this may not have been an isolated incident.” Women have also anonymously accused him of sexual harassment and assault in reports published by Variety and The New York Times.  Following his firing, which was announced live on Today by Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb, Lauer addressed the original allegations in a statement.  “There are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions,” he said, in part. “To the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry. As I am writing this, I realize the depth of the damage and disappointment I have left behind at home and at NBC.”  Although her PEOPLE interview is the first time Couric has spoken in detail about Lauer’s exit, she briefly broke her silence about the scandal on social media in December.  In a short response to an Instagram user, who called Couric out for not publicly addressing the scandal, the veteran journalist said, “It’s incredibly upsetting and I will say something when I’m ready to. Thanks for your interest.”  RELATED VIDEO: Women of Hollywood Attend Golden Globes Together in Support of the Time’s Up Movement  The claims against Lauer came as hundreds of women and men — including Rose McGowan, Ashley Judd, Terry Crews and Anthony Rapp — have publicly came forward about alleged sexual misconduct at the hands of powerful men in Hollywood, including Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey.  The movement inspired the new Time’s Up initiative and legal defense fund that was created to help victims of sexual misconduct pursue legal action against their perpetrators. Time’s Up was a major focus at this year’s Golden Globes, where almost all the famous attendees wore black to raise awareness about the cause.  “I think it was really moving to see so many women support each other and demand change, not only for themselves, but for mistreated and marginalized women in all kinds of industries,” Couric tells PEOPLE about Time’s Up. “Clearly we are witnessing a sea change and a long overdue course correction.”  She also said that one of the new of the episodes of her upcoming six-part documentary Nat Geo series will focus on harassment women have experienced in their workplaces.  “One of my Nat Geo episodes explores the various obstacles that are holding women back in Hollywood, Silicon Valley and beyond,” she says. “I just interviewed Elisabeth Moss about this. Harassment is just one part of the equation.”  RELATED VIDEO: Hoda Kotb and ","Katie Couric, aged 61, has recently discussed the distress and disappointment she felt after her former colleague Matt Lauer was fired from the Today show. Couric condemns the treatment of women at the show and expresses her shock at the allegations against Lauer, whom she describes as kind and respectful during their time working together. She mentions a joke she made about Lauer on a late-night show, clarifying that it was not an accurate depiction of their relationship. Couric praises her other former colleagues, Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb, for handling the difficult situation well. Couric left the Today show in 2006 after co-hosting with Lauer for 15 years. Lauer was fired in November 2017 due to a complaint of sexual misconduct, and other women have since come forward with allegations. Couric briefly addressed the scandal on social media in December and now discusses it in detail for the first time in an interview with PEOPLE magazine. She also mentions her support for the Time's Up movement, which aims to aid victims of sexual misconduct in pursuing legal action. Couric concludes by stating that one episode of her upcoming documentary series will focus on workplace harassment faced by women in various industries, including Hollywood and Silicon Valley."

But the male player ranked 701 in the world - Dmitry Tursunov - believes he could beat her.  Speaking to US radio station NPR, seven-time Grand Slam champion McEnroe said of former world number one Williams, who has won an Open-era record 23 Grand Slams: ""If she played the men's circuit she'd be, like, 700 in the world.""  He qualified the comments by saying: ""That doesn't mean I don't think Serena is an incredible player, and I suppose anything's possible; maybe at some point a women's tennis player can be better than anybody.""  But he added: ""I just haven't seen that in any other sport, and I haven't seen it in tennis. If she had to just play the men's circuit, it would be an entirely different story.""

""I've never played anyone ranked ""there"" nor do I have time. Respect me and my privacy as I'm trying to have a baby. Good day sir.""

The Russian told BBC World Service Sport he did not think McEnroe was ""trying to talk women's tennis down"" but said ""the reality"" was that ""men are stronger in general"".  ""I would hope that I would win against Serena,"" he added.  ""It would be a similar argument to: who would run faster, the fastest woman or the fastest man? Tennis is becoming more and more a physical sport, so it's going to be hard for a woman to beat the men.  ""It's not black and white, there are lots of factors to take into account. Physically I might not be in the best shape of my life but as an overall package I'm much better than my ranking would suggest. She is pregnant, and I'm not.

Williams disputes McEnroe's statement and believes she would perform well. However, Dmitry Tursunov, the male player ranked 701 in the world, thinks he could beat her. Tursunov acknowledges that tennis is a physical sport and believes men are generally stronger. He hopes that he would win against Williams if they were to play. Tursunov does not believe McEnroe is trying to belittle women's tennis, but he thinks men have an advantage due to their physical strength.

On Monday, January 7, 2013, twin sisters Rebeika Powell and Kayetie Powell-Melchor, 23; Misty Nunley, 33, and Julie Jackson, 55 were found shot in the head, with their hands tied behind their backs inside a south Tulsa apartment, police say.

When he was interviewed Wednesday, James Poore confirmed to investigators that he knew one of the victims and that he was in the apartment where the witnesses placed him. Before invoking his right to remain silent, he told investigators he knew one of the victims had used and sold illegal drugs and that Cedric drove a black van to the apartment the day of the murders.

I have the utmost confidence in Chief Chuck Jordan and the Tulsa Police Department and I knew they would bring in those involved with this hideous quadruple murder in very short order.

It went from that, to checking in on each other once a week through email — ‘This s–t happened to me, what happened to you?’ — to maybe three times a week, then every day, to ‘Hey, here’s my phone number if you ever want to text,’” Shelton told Billboard. “Next thing I know, I wake up and she’s all I care about, and I’m ­wondering if she feels the same about me.”  “Gwen saved my life,” he added. “Who else on earth could understand going through a high-profile divorce from another musician? You can’t even imagine the similarities in our divorces.”  The two teamed up professionally too. Shelton included their collaborative track, “Go Ahead and Break My Heart,” on his 12th studio album, If I’m Honest.  “When we recorded the vocals for some of these songs, I was only six months removed from when all the crap went down,” Shelton said of his split from Lambert. “When you have a broken heart — at least, when I do — you got to get it out of your system. You want people to sympathize with you. I was at rock bottom, in the middle of hell.”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!

Wintour introduced sweeping changes to Vogue from her first issue forward. Many of these changes could be seen right on the cover. Wintour favored more naturalistic photography of lesser-known models outside, as opposed to the tight headshots the magazine had previously favored. Additionally, Wintour's first Vogue cover was also the first to feature a model wearing jeans, with the added bonus of wearing a bejeweled T-shirt valued at around $10,000.

It’s been more than two years since Blake Shelton, 40, and Miranda Lambert, 33, ended their marriage, but she’s finally ready to sit down and hash things out, according to a new report.

She’s very happy with her man, Anderson East, 29, but feels a face-to-face with Blake is what she needs to fully be ready to commit to another relationship, according to the source.  “She feels that [she and Blake] have both grown so much since their divorce that meeting up is essential for them to have healthy relationships in the future,” InTouch’s insider says. “Who knows, maybe this meeting with Blake will have them walk away as friends.

But I’m not forcing anything right now.”  As far as her relationship with the 42-year-old former Yankees player, she said: “It’s good, it’s healthy; we communicate well. We understand each other’s lives in a way that most other people couldn’t.”  She added: “We both entered the public eye in our early twenties and overachieved right from the start. And that affects every dynamic in your life, from your family to your work to your relationships. We have a similar makeup.”  The pair celebrated their anniversary in February in Minneapolis, where the singer performed a concert ahead of the Super Bowl.

I don’t want to get all mushy or anything, but baby, this song’s for you. I love you,” she told the athlete while on stage.  When talking about how she chose the song, Lopez told the magazine that the lyrics fit right into where the couple were in their relationship. She said: “They played me about 20 different songs, and when I heard this one I was like, ‘Oh, this is relevant!’ Alex and I were just getting to know each other. And I was like, ‘Oh, my God, could this be? Could this be us?’”  Lopez was previously married to chef Ojani Noa for nearly a year in 1997, and dancer Cris Judd from 2001 to 2002.

I also know my strengths and weaknesses. It took me a long time to get to a point where I could say something nice about myself. I’m glad I can do that now.”  Lopez remains optimistic as she continues with her career, raise her two children and make her relationship with Rodriguez work for the long run. “Baseball is just like life,” she said. “All you want to do is hit a home run.”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!","Jennifer Lopez is not in a hurry to marry Alex Rodriguez, but she does want to spend her life with someone.

gossipcop-5658990975,1,0,"Daniel Craig is returning as James Bond once again, even as he reportedly fights to save his marriage to Rachel Weisz at the same time. Craig has already announced his intent to return as 007 in the franchise’s 25th film, and according to the National Enquirer, he’s still struggling to salvage what’s left of his marriage.  The Enquirer’s source claimed at the beginning of 2017, “Rachel and Daniel haven’t been happy for a while, and nearly called it quits last year.” The report claims that the married couple was in two separate filming locations at the beginning of the year, but continued to stay apart even after wrapping their respective films. The Enquirer then claims that they finally reunited in July after not being seen together in ‘554 days’.  According to the sources, the minute the outlet attempted to lock down an exclusive on the couple’s rocky marriage, both Rachel Weisz and Daniel Craig were seen arriving at New York’s Public Theater the next day, prompting the source to add, “The whole thing just seemed like too much of a coincidence. I don’t buy it for a minute.”  When you consider Daniel Craig’s own words, especially in the context of allegedly turning down a $150 million payday to star in two more James Bond films, he had stated, “Being on your own would be sad, sick, and weird. I don’t trust myself. I need that balance.” If these reports are to be believed, then Daniel Craig previously turned down starring in more Bond films to spend time with his family, but now – all of a sudden – he’s back to working on James Bond?  Either the report was never accurate to begin with, or he’s giving up on his marriage to Rachel Weisz. One would hope that the two have worked out whatever was troubling them in the first place, but given their own relationship and marriage histories – and how they’ve both jumped ship on long-term relationships at the drop of a hat – one wouldn’t be faulted for assuming that they are on their way to getting a divorce.  What do you guys think? Are Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz having marriage troubles, and is Daniel’s decision to take on the role of 007 again an indication that he’s giving up on his marriage? Or just a chance to have more career stability and/or cash in on a major paycheck? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.

The couple allegedly had a rough patch and almost broke up last year. Even when they were filming in different locations at the beginning of the year, they continued to live separately after completing their respective projects. However, they were seen together in public in July after 554 days apart, which some find suspicious. The Enquirer suggests that their sudden reunion was prompted by the outlet's attempt to obtain an exclusive about their troubled marriage. In the past, Craig has expressed the importance of having a balanced personal life and previously declined a huge payday to spend time with his family. The decision to return to the Bond franchise raises questions about his commitment to his marriage. It is unclear whether the initial report was accurate or if Craig is giving up on his relationship. While one would hope they have resolved their problems, considering their past histories of ending long-term relationships, it wouldn't be surprising if they were headed for a divorce.

gossipcop-4774142356,1,0,"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired. T","Katie Holmes is facing a challenging situation, as rumors circulate regarding her relationships with Jamie Foxx, Tom Cruise, and their daughter Suri. According to RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of getting married, planning a grand ceremony with Suri as a bridesmaid. This event would have solidified their relationship, which had been mostly covert for the past five years. However, Holmes discovered that Foxx was not ready to give up his bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with his ex-girlfriend Kristin Grannis, who is the mother of his daughter. This realization prompted Holmes to call off the wedding and break up with Foxx. A source informed RadarOnline that Foxx was reluctant to sign a prenuptial agreement with a no-cheating clause, as it would have been costly for him to be unfaithful. Holmes noticed a lack of respect in Foxx's behavior, which she deemed unhealthy for herself and Suri, leading her to protect them by ending the relationship. Simultaneously, it seems that Holmes has been dealing with Cruise's attempts to reconnect with Suri. According to Star magazine and Hollywood Life, Cruise was separated from his daughter due to the influence of his Church of Scientology superiors. Despite being a loyal Scientologist, Cruise is tired of being controlled and misses out on her life. Holmes, however, does not want a reunion as she made an agreement with Cruise to stay quiet about him and Scientology as long as he stays away from Suri and doesn't try to indoctrinate her into the controversial organization. Nevertheless, Holmes is torn because she wants what is best for Suri and believes that her daughter is missing her father. Ultimately, Holmes may be considering the possibility of a reunion. Representatives for Holmes have denied the reports about the breakup with Foxx and the potential reunion with Cruise and Suri. However, it is worth noting that Holmes' publicist, Leslie Sloane, personally denied the breakup report, which carries significance since it is the first official acknowledgment of their relationship from either Holmes or Foxx. The couple had kept their relationship a secret since 2013, with Holmes even wearing disguises to meet Foxx in public. The secrecy was necessary due to a divorce settlement agreement with Cruise that prohibited Holmes from publicly dating anyone for five years. Speculation arose in September 2017 when Holmes and Foxx were photographed together on a beach, suggesting that the previously imposed dating ban had ended."

The pair first met aged two at Hollywood’s private Little Red School House before they went to the Immaculate Heart girls’ high school in Los Angeles at the age of 11.  Following a close friendship that she describes as 'sisterly', Ninaki says the pair eventually fell out over how Meghan and ex-husband - who the ex Suits star met when she was just 23 - split.  She explains she went to visit Trevor who was heartbroken over their split, while Meghan seemed less affected.

""We used to imagine her receiving an Oscar. She used to practise announcing herself.""  While talking about her relationship with Harry and her role as a future royal, Ninaki claims Meghan was always very aware of the Royal Family - despite the actress claiming she knew little about Harry when they met.  ""I think it’s a very fanciful dream to believe that you just walk into a Prince Charming.  ""I know the Royal Family was something she found fascinating. She had one of Princess Diana’s books [Diana: Her True Story] on her bookshelf, and even when she was with Trevor she told me she wanted to go and stay in London for at least a month.""  She added: ""I wasn’t shocked or even surprised to hear about Prince Harry. I know she used to love The Princess Diaries — films about a commoner who becomes part of a Royal Family. She was very taken with that idea.""","Meghan Markle's close childhood friend, Ninaki Priddy, has revealed the true reason behind Meghan's divorce from her first husband, Trevor Engelson. According to Ninaki, Meghan's desire for fame outweighed her commitment to her marriage, causing her to end the relationship after landing a role in the TV show Suits. Contrary to previous beliefs that their split was due to distance, with Meghan filming in Canada and Trevor in LA, Ninaki claims that Trevor was blindsided by the breakup while Meghan seemed less affected. Ninaki, who was the maid of honor at Meghan's wedding, described how the couple had a loving relationship before Meghan's fame, but things changed after she achieved success. The two friends eventually fell out over the way Meghan and Trevor split. Ninaki also revealed that Meghan always had a longing for fame and an interest in the Royal Family, despite claiming to know little about Prince Harry before their relationship. She mentioned that Meghan had a book about Princess Diana on her shelf and had expressed a desire to visit London for an extended period. The news of Meghan's romance with Prince Harry did not come as a shock to Ninaki, as Meghan had always been fascinated with stories of commoners becoming part of a royal family, such as in The Princess Diaries films."

gossipcop-1551062653,1,0,"  George Clooney and his wife, Amal, attend the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. (Alberto Pizzoli/AFP via Getty Images)  Once the ultimate bachelor — and two-time People’s Sexiest Man Alive cover model — George Clooney entered entirely new territory this week.  The Oscar-winning actor and his human-rights-lawyer wife of two years, Amal, announced Tuesday that they are the proud new parents of twins, Ella and Alexander.  Clooney has donned many hats in his life — actor, director, producer and activist, but fatherhood had always seemed far away. Was it the early-onset-salt-and-pepper hair? The coterie of models who found themselves on his arm for fleeting moments over the years? The insistence by tabloids and fellow co-stars that it was time for him to settle down? Maybe. Or perhaps it was the simple fact that Clooney himself said again and again that he would not reproduce. In several interviews. Many, many times. For many, many years.  A first-time father at 56, Clooney was often asked throughout his career whether the single life was his ultimate future. But after proposing marriage to Amal in April 2014 and marrying her that September (as well as sharing wedding photos with People magazine in the United States and Hello magazine in Britain), it seemed as if anything was possible for the man who once said, “I don’t see myself ever having kids.”  But it was a long road to get there. “I don’t have that gene that people have to replicate,” he told People in 2006.  When Esquire asked him why he wasn’t married with kids, he replied, “I haven’t had aspirations in that way, ever.” And as for people who thought it was weird that a man in his 50s was single and childless? “What do you do? Should I go, ‘I got to get me some kids right now!’ and rush out and impregnate someone?”  Clooney seemed to express frustration when asked how he could ever relate to the fathers he occasionally portrays onscreen. His answer: “Well, I’m also not running for president, but I played that role in ‘Ides of March.’ I wasn’t an actual lawyer when I did ‘Michael Clayton,’ and I don’t fire people for a living like I did in ‘Up in the Air.’ ”  “I keep saying I’ll never get married again or have children but people just don’t want to believe me,” Clooney told Britain’s Daily Express just three months before popping the question to his now-wife.  Of course, celebrities are people, too, and it shouldn’t surprise anyone that a man might change his mind around the midcentury mark. And Clooney is certainly not alone in choosing to wait till later in life to welcome a child into the family: Comedian Steve Martin became a father at age 67 in 2012; Elton John was 63 when he had a baby via a surrogate in 2010; and Chris Noth was 53 when he welcomed his only child in 2008.  Perhaps it’s the fact that Clooney always seemed so delightfully and devilishly Clooney-ish that made his bachelordom seem like the only constant in our ever-changing popular culture. But we can rest easy knowing that despite some hesitation about having a family over the years, his sense of humor has remained steady throughout.  “Ella, Alexander and Amal are all healthy, happy and doing fine,” the statement announcing the birth of the twins read. “George is sedated and should recover in a few days.”","George Clooney and his wife, Amal, made an appearance at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. However, this week marked a significant change for Clooney, who was once known as the ultimate bachelor and a two-time cover model for People's Sexiest Man Alive. He and his wife, Amal, who is a human-rights lawyer, proudly announced on Tuesday that they have become parents to twins, Ella and Alexander. Up until now, fatherhood seemed unlikely for Clooney, given his reputation as a bachelor and his previous statements about not wanting to have children. In several interviews over the years, he expressed his lack of desire to reproduce. Despite this, at the age of 56, Clooney surprised many by marrying Amal in 2014 and sharing wedding photos with People magazine and Hello magazine. While he had never envisioned himself settling down with a family, he eventually changed his tune. Clooney often faced questions about his single status and the absence of children throughout his career. However, he brushed off these inquiries and expressed his lack of interest in marriage and children. In 2006, he told People magazine that he did not have the desire to replicate. When asked why he wasn't married with kids by Esquire, he simply stated that he never aspired to have them. He also sarcastically responded to those who found it strange that he was single and childless in his 50s. Despite his initial reservations, Clooney later proposed to Amal and got married. However, his journey to embracing fatherhood was not without its challenges. Three months prior to his marriage, he expressed his skepticism about getting married or having children in an interview with Britain's Daily Express. Nevertheless, it is not uncommon for people to change their minds later in life, and Clooney is no exception. Many celebrities, like Steve Martin, Elton John, and Chris Noth, have also chosen to become parents later in life. Clooney's charming and playful persona may have contributed to the perception that he would remain a bachelor forever, but his recent decision to start a family proves otherwise. Despite his initial hesitations, Clooney's sense of humor has remained intact throughout this journey. The statement announcing the birth of his twins noted that Ella, Alexander, and Amal are all in good health and that George is recovering after being sedated."

Pattinson also recalled riding in trunks several times to hide from the photographers – and once drove around all night when one was tailing him to find out where his new house is.  “There are ways to disappear, like, fairly easily,” he said. “It just involves effort, and most people can’t be bothered to put the effort in.”  Good Time hits theaters August 11.","Following his rise to fame in Twilight, Robert Pattinson has become increasingly private due to the negative risk and reward balance that comes with opening up in interviews. The actor, who is currently dating singer F.K.A. Twigs, prefers to keep his personal life under wraps to avoid being labeled as dishonest or having his personality misconstrued. He has even gone to great lengths to maintain his privacy, including changing cars and outfits to confuse paparazzi and going as far as hiding in trunks to escape their attention. Pattinson admits that disappearing is not difficult, but it requires effort that most people are unwilling to put in."

gossipcop-7658353025,1,0,"“A Star Is Born” is that thing we always yearn for but so rarely get to see: a transcendent Hollywood movie. It’s the fourth remake of a story that dates back to 1932, but this one has a look and vibe all its own — rapturous and swooning, but also delicate and intimate and luminous. It’s set in the present day, but in spirit it’s a sophisticated retro ’70s drama built around the uncanny flow of feeling that develops between the movie’s two stars: Bradley Cooper, who plays Jackson Maine, a hard-drinking, bad-ol’-boy redneck rock ‘n’ roller who is still hanging on as a popular attraction but has lost the lust for what he’s doing, and Lady Gaga, in her fetching and accomplished movie-star debut, as Ally, an ingenuous, fresh-faced singer-songwriter who becomes his lover and stage partner before rocketing on her own into the new pop stratosphere. She takes off as he slowly crashes — that’s the soapy tragic “Star Is Born” concept. But what the movie does is to take this fabled melodramatic romantic seesaw and turn it into something indelibly heartfelt and revealing. Cooper directed the movie himself, working from a script he co-wrote with Eric Roth and Will Fetters, and to say that he does a good job would be to understate his accomplishment. As a filmmaker, Bradley Cooper gets right onto the high wire, staging scenes that take their time and play out with a shaggy intimacy that’s shorn of the usual “beats.” The new “Star Is Born” is a total emotional knockout, but it’s also a movie that gets you to believe, at every step, in the complicated rapture of the story it’s telling. More Reviews Venice Film review: 'Isis, Tomorrow. The Lost Souls of Mosul' Telluride Film Review: 'They'll Love Me When I'm Dead' The 1976 version, starring Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson, had some terrific cornball love songs, but they didn’t belong anywhere near the stadium-rock stage, and neither did Streisand, which is part of why the movie came off as borderline ludicrous. It seemed stranded, with a kind of campy sincere ineptitude, between three worlds: Old Hollywood, New Hollywood, and Barbra Streisand rock-princess fantasy. But from the electrifying opening moments of the new version, in which Jackson, boozy and raw, with his sunburned squint and hard-bitten shit-kicker sexiness, takes the stage of a gigantic stadium and launches into a grinding slow rocker that sounds like “Victim of Love”-era Eagles as done by the Allman Brothers, the movie is thrillingly authentic. That’s no minor accomplishment. Hollywood almost never succeeds in nailing the rock world, but “A Star Is Born,” though a love story through and through, is the most lived-in rock ‘n’ roll movie since “Almost Famous.” And that absolute looks right, sounds right, feels right verisimilitude sets the stage for everything that follows. Jackson, who looks to be in his mid-40s, has been around long enough that he now occupies a grey zone between legend and nostalgia. He can still fill an arena full of screaming fans, and his old hits have become classic-rock chestnuts, but his sound and persona have long slipped out of the zeitgeist. His whole outlaw look — the beard and rancher’s hat, the Kristofferson-meets-Skynyrd soused macho twinkle — mark him as a charismatic relic, and the grand irony is this: What that look, and sound, are all about is an era when rock ‘n’ roll strutted its “authenticity,” but now that he’s out of date, Jackson’s authenticity looks more than ever like a showbiz conceit, frozen in amber. It’s a part he’s playing, an image he’s working — and secretly struggling — to keep alive. He’s got a signature ballad that goes “Maybe it’s time to let the old ways die,” and when he wrote it (long ago), he probably didn’t know that he was talking about himself. In the first of many telling jump cuts, the film leaps from his on-stage glory to Jackson slinking into the back of his car, weary and alone, grabbing the bottle of gin he’s got stashed there. He takes a guzzle, and Coop","The film ""A Star Is Born"" is a rare and exceptional Hollywood movie that captures the audience's attention. It stands out as the fourth remake of a story that dates back to 1932, yet it possesses its own unique style and atmosphere. The film takes place in modern times but has a retro '70s vibe, creating a sophisticated and captivating drama. The story revolves around the captivating connection between the two main characters: Jackson Maine, a well-known rock 'n' roll artist struggling with personal demons, played by Bradley Cooper, and Ally, a talented singer-songwriter who becomes his lover and rises to fame on her own, portrayed by Lady Gaga. As she flourishes, he falters, following the classic tragic ""Star Is Born"" concept. However, what sets this movie apart is its ability to delve deep into the emotions of the characters, presenting a heartfelt and revealing narrative. Bradley Cooper, who directed the film and co-wrote the script with Eric Roth and Will Fetters, has done an exceptional job. He fearlessly takes risks by creating scenes that unfold naturally and intimately, without adhering to the usual conventions. ""A Star Is Born"" is not only emotionally captivating but also skillfully convinces the audience to embrace and believe in the complex story it tells. In contrast, the previous 1976 version featuring Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson failed to truly capture the essence of the rock world. The love songs in that version felt out of place on the stadium-rock stage, and Streisand herself seemed misplaced, leaving the film feeling campy and awkward. However, the new ""A Star Is Born"" immediately establishes its authenticity and credibility from the very first moments. Jackson, with his rugged appearance and edgy charisma, takes the stage of a massive stadium and delivers a mesmerizing performance that perfectly embodies the rock 'n' roll spirit of the era. The movie effortlessly achieves a sense of truthfulness in its depiction of the music genre, something that is rarely accomplished by Hollywood. Jackson, in his mid-40s, finds himself situated between legendary status and being outdated. Although he still draws large crowds and his old songs have become classics, his sound and image have faded from the mainstream. The irony lies in the fact that his signature look and sound, which once projected authenticity, now appear as showbiz clichés frozen in time. It is a role he continues to play, attempting to preserve his image, all while secretly struggling to keep up. Jackson has a renowned ballad that questions the need to hold on to the past, and it's almost as if he unknowingly foretold his own destiny when he wrote it. In a significant moment, the film transitions from his on-stage success to a vulnerable and exhausted Jackson alone in his car, reaching for his bottle of gin. Cooper masterfully portrays the desperation Jackson feels for his drink, embodying the character's state without resorting to exaggerated drunkenness. He depicts a functioning and charming drunk, his smile and reflexes enhanced by alcohol. Jackson's deep, deliberate Southern accent, infused with the remnants of his alcohol consumption, adds even more dimension to his character. Craving another drink, he instructs his driver to take him to the nearest bar, which happens to be a roadside dive hosting drag-queen karaoke night. Despite the unusual setting, Jackson doesn't mind, as he is always recognized wherever he goes. In this state of contentment, he watches as Ally, the only non-drag performer of the night, takes the stage. With her unique appearance, adorned in heavy makeup, exaggerated eyebrows, and extravagant hair, she captivates the audience with her rendition of ""La Vie en Rose."" Backstage, Jackson removes one of Ally's eyebrows and invites her for a drink, marking the beginning of their relationship."

It is hard to imagine a My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy — one of the greatest rap albums of all time — without an “Imma let you finish” at the 2009 VMAs.  His new album, ye, doesn’t merit any similar mercy.  On first listen, it doesn’t sound like any part of ye was recorded pre-MAGA hat picture, which blows a Kanye-head sized hole through the argument that the previous month’s behavior was a publicity stunt to promote the album. If anything, the album seems like an meek afterthought to the Twitter tirade and dive into right-wing politics. Most of it deals with the repercussions of the storm which came before it, and for the first time in his career, the artist’s personality is overwhelming the art.  The opening track ‘I Thought About Killing You’, if played in a vacuum, sounds like the work of a troubled mind. If a poem like this came from a loved one, it would surely merit discussion about a trip to the therapist. Kanye goes on to deliver cringe-worthy rhymes on issues ranging from Russell Simmons rape allegations to his petrification on realizing that his daughter might one day look like his wife. He teases a few tidbits of The Old Kanye, chopping up beats from Slick Rick and The Edwin Hawkins Singers samples on ‘No Mistakes’, to keep his fans just interested enough. It’s telling that the one standout track, ‘Ghost Town’ is the track on which Kanye lurks in the background, devoting more time on production than on spoken word, and letting John Legend and Kid Cudi take over.  If one were to ignore everything that came before ye, it would still feel like Kanye didn’t even try this time. The usual meticulousness and perfectionism has apparently been supplanted by a Kanye shrug. The music is haphazard and hollow, mirroring the guy making it.

He did say he wanted to run for President in 2020 (or 2024?) anyway.","Kanye's unpredictability has often been forgiven in the past, even earning him praise. For instance, his interruption at the 2009 VMAs is now an iconic moment in the history of rap music, an integral part of his groundbreaking album, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. However, his latest album, ye, does not deserve the same leniency. Upon first listen, it becomes apparent that the entire album lacks any trace of material recorded prior to his controversial MAGA hat photo. This undermines the argument that his recent behavior was a mere publicity stunt to promote the album. Rather, ye seems like an afterthought to his Twitter outbursts and venture into right-wing politics. It mostly deals with the consequences of his previous actions, and for the first time in his career, Kanye's personal identity outweighs the art he creates.

Kanye proceeds to deliver cringe-worthy verses on sensitive subjects, ranging from Russell Simmons' sexual assault allegations to his apprehensions about his daughter resembling his wife. He offers glimpses of his past brilliance by sampling beats from Slick Rick and The Edwin Hawkins Singers on 'No Mistakes', hoping to maintain some interest from his fans. Interestingly, the standout track, 'Ghost Town', allows Kanye to step back and focus more on production, letting John Legend and Kid Cudi take the spotlight. Even if we disregard everything that preceded ye, it still feels like Kanye didn't put in much effort this time. His usual meticulousness and perfectionism have seemingly been replaced with indifference. The music feels disjointed and lacking substance, mirroring Kanye's current state of being.

Lisa Kudrow has offered up even more proof that the cast of “Friends” took the name of the beloved sitcom to heart.  On Monday, the actress told People that her co-stars altered a pre-show ritual when she was pregnant during Seasons 4 and 5 to include her unborn child — her now 20-year-old son, Julian Murray Stern.  “The six of us would do a huddle backstage and just say, ‘All right, have a good show, love you love you love you love you,’” Kudrow, 55, told the outlet. “And when I was pregnant, then they would say, ‘Have a great show, love you love you — love you, little Julian!’ ’Cause we knew it was a boy and that was his name.”  She added: “So sweet, they included my little fetus in the huddle.”  The stars of “Friends” embraced one another’s children at other times, too.

The obvious answer is that Justin and Hailey are in love and want to spend forever together, but there's also a rumor lurking in some corners of the internet (read: Twitter) claiming that Hailey's pregnant.

gossipcop-1716370499,1,0,"Dakota Johnson; most of us know her as the actress from Fifty Shades of Grey. While we may have seen Johnson in some pretty intimate positions on-screen, there’s definitely a lot we don’t know about the Fifty Shades star. Like, for instance, the superfluity of familiar names in her family tree. Seeing that her popular movie, Fifty Shades Darker came out on the day of love—Valentine's Day—it's only fitting to dedicate a piece to the actress who brought us the sexy and quaint, Anastasia Steele. Johnson, after all, has become somewhat something of a Valentine’s Day staple, herself. Here are 15 facts about Dakota Johnson or, as some might call her, ""that girl from Fifty Shades of Grey."" We guarantee that she will no longer by ""that girl"" by the end of the list! 15 Her Family Tree Is Full Of Famous Faces You know how we said there are a few familiar names in her family tree? Well, we weren’t lying. Her parents are fellow actors, Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson. Unfortunately, her parents divorced in 1994 so Dakota had to split her time between the two. ""It was the only way that I could be with them,"" she said in an interview for Cosmopolitan. ""And since they were divorced, I would spend two weeks with one and two weeks with the other, traveling with a tutor."" But wait, it gets better. Her maternal grandmother (can you guess..) is Hitchcock actress Tippi Hedren. Yes, that’s right, so clearly creative talent lies in that family. We’ve never heard of a family tree with so many famous names! Thanksgiving is probably a whirlwind. Now, Dakota Johnson is another famous name in that tree. 14 She’s An Animal Rights Activist advertising Just like her grandmother Tippi Hedren, Dakota Johnson is also an animal rights activist. Like grandmother, like granddaughter shall we say? As animal lovers ourselves, we’re pleased to hear that she’s following in her grandmother’s footsteps—both in acting and in animal rights. In 2014, Johnson saved 12 horses from being slaughtered by paying for them. What a sweet thing to do! We bet her grandmother was really proud. It’s always so great to hear about celebrities doing positive things - so naturally, we’re happy to hear of Dakota’s compassionate side. We admit we have a soft spot for animal lovers, but who doesn't? We always love hearing about people doing good deeds for animals and it’s always nice to hear celebrities using their celebrity title for the better. 13 She Grew Up Shooting Guns And Riding Horses In Colorado She may play the innocent and naive Anastasia Steele in the Fifty Shades movies, but growing up Johnson was anything but naive. She grew up in Colorado at her dad’s house, where she learned to build a fire, ride a horse, ride motorbikes, and even shoot a gun. And this was all before she was just 10 years old! Sounds like a badass kid to us! But when she wasn’t at her father’s house, she was at her mom’s house in L.A. which she also loved. It's hard to imagine a 10 year old these days shooting guns, riding motorbikes, or building fires without being grounded. But it sounds like she had a pretty inspiring and freeing childhood which makes us fall for the actress all the more. 12 She Never Dates advertising By the header, we mean she never has casual relationships. She only has long-term relationships. Good for her, is all we can say! You hear of so many celebrities who are constantly dating other celebrities. You can barely keep up with who they’re dating these days. It seems to be one guy or girl after another. So it’s great to hear of Dakota’s conservative views on relationships. Apparently she’s only ever been in long-term, serious relationships; she doesn’t just date. That probably explains why she’s been in a relationship with model Matthew Hitt since 2014. Yes, it’s been a kind of an on-and-off relationship but they’ve been in it for the long haul so far. So, to sum up, we like her whole dating attitude. The commitment is great and saves you a lot of time. 11 She HATED School It seems l","Dakota Johnson, the actress known for her role in Fifty Shades of Grey, has a lot more to her than what meets the eye on screen. Her family tree is full of famous faces, including her parents Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson, and her maternal grandmother, Tippi Hedren. Johnson is not only an actress, but an animal rights activist as well. In 2014, she saved 12 horses from being slaughtered by paying for them. Despite playing the innocent Anastasia Steele in Fifty Shades, Johnson grew up in Colorado where she learned to shoot guns, ride horses, and build fires. When it comes to dating, Johnson prefers long-term relationships over casual ones. She has been in an on-and-off relationship with model Matthew Hitt since 2014. Surprisingly, Johnson admits to hating school because she felt like an ""alien"" and disliked the suffocating feeling of the education system. Auditioning gives her panic attacks, showing that even A-list celebrities have self-doubt and insecurity."

gossipcop-9811720113,1,0,"I, at least, struggle to understand her career. Her performance as a junkie in “The Town” features the “Bride Wars” of Boston accents. Her performance in “The Age of Adaline” — as a woman “cursed” to stay 30 forever — was like watching a mermaid ride a bike. She tries. But her acting hasn’t yet caught up to her algorithm-generated beauty. Alas, there may be no algorithmic solution for that.  So I was less than psyched at the prospect of seeing her shiver on a buoy, stitch her own wounds, talk to animals or play a Nancy. And, as refreshing as it is watching her stand on a surfboard, it’s refreshment that provides some perspective. While some actors make sense on movie screens, there are others who might make better sense on a can of something — beer, beans, air. I can hear you, Hudson skeptics.

And sell your Brad Rowe stock, because he’s just going to be replaced by Brad Pitt. (In the late 1990s, that pretty much happened.) But there are continuums, too. Channing Tatum, for instance, is a more elastic, hip-hop-era Brendan Fraser upgrade.  Lots of parts that have gone to Ms. Lively feel as if Ms. Hudson could have played them. But something happened, and suddenly it was someone else’s turn to be “it.” (It’s always someone else’s turn.) And part of what annoys me about the lack of Kate Hudson in my life and the surfeit of Ms. Lively is the same thing that makes me angry when a perfectly good piece of software gets a superfluous update, or a zealous waiter takes my plate at a restaurant: I wasn’t done with that.","I, at least, find it difficult to comprehend her career.

gossipcop-6722352082,1,0,"Carlotta is a fictional character from Gaston Leroux's 1909 novel The Phantom of the Opera.  In the novel, she is a minor character hailing from Spain. The first time that she is mentioned in the novel is during the chapter ""The New Marguerite"", where it is revealed that she could not perform at the ceremony for the former managers. Later in the novel, she is threatened by Erik that if she performs at the Opera House ""a great misfortune will strike"". She shrugs the warning off and performs anyway. When she does, however, croaking noises come out of her mouth and the chandelier comes crashing down. Ashamed, she hides from the public view for a few weeks, before making a return to the opera house.  Carlotta is portrayed by Virginia Pearson in the original 1925 silent film with Lon Chaney. In 1929, new sound scenes were filmed and Mary Fabian was recast as Carlotta, due to the fact that she could sing. Virginia Pearson still appeared in new scenes, now playing Carlotta's mother. These changes are also the same in the 1929 silent, foreign cut of the film (which is most commonly viewed).  In the 1943 film version, she is Mme. Biancarolli who has been drugged by the Phantom and murdered along with her maid when she tries to force him to take off his prop mask.  In Andrew Lloyd Webber's production, Carlotta (last name Giudicelli) is from Italy and is one of the major singing parts. The opera company's prima donna, she despises Christine Daaé and sees the younger woman as a threat to her job and Phantom´s courtesan, when Christine achieves prominence due to the Phantom's dirty tricks. Carlotta and tenor Ubaldo Piangi are lovers; she often turns to him for consolation when things go wrong, and she breaks down crying when his murdered body is discovered onstage. The film reveals that she likes poodles.  In the Lloyd Webber-Joel Schumacher 2004 film version, she was played by Minnie Driver.[1] Due to Driver's lack of experience in opera, her singing voice was dubbed by opera singer Margaret Preece, although she lent her actual voice to the song ""Learn to Be Lonely"" during the end credits.  In Nicholas Meyer's novel The Canary Trainer, the characters of Carlotta and La Sorelli are combined into one, despite being mentioned as separate characters in the original novel. In Kim Newman's short story ""Angels of Music"" from the Tales of the Shadowmen anthology series, Carlotta is implied to be the ancestor of Bianca Castafiore from The Adventures of Tintin comic series.","Carlotta, a character from Gaston Leroux's novel The Phantom of the Opera, is a fictional minor character from Spain.

gossipcop-178000221,1,0,"Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge wasn’t always a royal, but even before her marriage to Prince William, Kate Middleton had an impressive net worth.  Middleton had a comfortable upbringing before she became the first commoner to join the royal family after she married William in 2011. But Middleton’s net worth ballooned once she became a duchess.  Here’s everything we know about Middleton’s net worth:  What is Kate Middleton’s net worth?  The 36 year-old mother of three — who gave birth to a second baby boy in April — is worth at least £5 million, or $7 million, according to global wealth-tracking firm Wealth-X, though some estimates put her net worth as high as £7.3 million, or $10 million. Middleton’s wealth is mostly in cash because she doesn’t have a personal portfolio of property or artwork.  That being said, Middleton’s net worth is a lot less than her prince — Wealth-X estimates Prince William’s net worth is at least $30 million, though some reports put his fortune closer to $40 million. According to Wealth-X, $19 million of Prince William’s wealth is in cash. The wealth tracking firm also noted that William has an expensive helicopter fit for a royal — an Augusta A109S Grand helicopter which is valued at $11 million.  Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, Prince George of Cambridge and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge arrive for a children's party for Military families during the Royal Tour of Canada on September 29, 2016 in Victoria, Canada. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  What do we know about Kate Middleton’s money?  Most of Middleton’s net worth stems from Party Pieces, an online party supplies business started by her parents. The company is estimated to be worth around £30 million, or $50 million, thanks in no small part to the exposure it gets from being associated with the royals, according to royal expert Marlene Koenig.  Prior to her life as a full-time duchess, Middleton worked for the family business and was a part-time accessories buyer for a retailer called Jigsaw.  Growing up, Kate and her two siblings, Pippa and James Middleton, attended expensive privates schools from a young age, with years of tuition for just one child estimated to be at least £250,000, or $350,000. Kate met Prince William while in college in Scotland at the prestigious University of St. Andrew’s. She graduated in 2005 with a degree in Art History.  How did Kate Middleton’s net worth change after marrying Prince William?  Joining the royal family meant that Middleton was marrying into an incredible $88 billion fortune amassed over generations.  Before Will and Kate became the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and moved into a 20-room apartment in Kensington Palace, Kate lived in an apartment purchased by her parents in the Chelsea neighborhood of London believed to be worth £1 million, or $1.4 million.  Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge smile following their marriage at Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011 in London, England. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  But once Kate officially became a royal she didn’t need to spend much of her own money anymore. Most of her living costs are covered by the private estate Prince Charles manages, the Duchy of Cornwall. The revenue from the Duchy of Cornwall pays for the most of Prince Charles and his family’s royal expenses: things like official travel, wardrobe, housing and staff costs. When Meghan Markle marries Prince Harry on May 19, she too, will get to keep most of her own money — her net worth is believed to be about $5 million — as the Duchy of Cornwall will also absorb the majority of her living costs associated with royal responsibilities.  What is the ‘Kate effect’?  As the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate sets fashion trends all over the world. While she herself does not retain any income from the flurry of economic activity set off by the designer clothes she wears for public appearances, she has triggered what is known as “the Kate Effect,” ","Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge did not come from a royal background, but even before marrying Prince William, Kate Middleton had a considerable net worth. Middleton had a comfortable upbringing prior to joining the royal family, becoming the first commoner to do so in 2011. However, her net worth significantly increased once she became a duchess. Here is everything we know about Middleton’s net worth: At the age of 36, as a mother of three, Middleton is worth at least £5 million or $7 million, according to the wealth-tracking firm Wealth-X. Though some estimates suggest her net worth could be as high as £7.3 million or $10 million. Middleton's wealth is mainly in cash as she does not possess personal property or artwork. It is important to note that Middleton's net worth is much lower than Prince William's. Wealth-X estimates that Prince William's net worth is at least $30 million, with some reports suggesting it could be closer to $40 million. According to Wealth-X, $19 million of Prince William's wealth is in cash. The wealth tracking firm also mentions that Prince William owns an expensive helicopter worth $11 million, the Augusta A109S Grand helicopter. Most of Middleton's net worth comes from Party Pieces, an online party supplies business founded by her parents. The company is estimated to be worth around £30 million or $50 million, in part due to its association with the royal family. Before becoming a full-time duchess, Middleton worked for her family's business and was a part-time buyer for a retailer called Jigsaw. Middleton had an affluent upbringing, attending expensive private schools with tuition for just one child estimated to be at least £250,000 or $350,000. Kate met Prince William while both were studying at the University of St. Andrew’s in Scotland, where she graduated with a degree in Art History in 2005. Joining the royal family meant that Middleton married into a vast fortune of $88 billion accumulated over generations. Before becoming the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and moving into a 20-room apartment in Kensington Palace, Kate lived in a Chelsea apartment purchased by her parents, believed to be worth £1 million or $1.4 million. However, once she officially became a royal, Middleton's personal expenses significantly reduced. Most of her living costs are covered by the Duchy of Cornwall, a private estate managed by Prince Charles. The revenue from the Duchy of Cornwall also pays for the majority of Prince Charles and his family's royal expenditures, including travel, wardrobe, housing, and staff costs. Similarly, when Meghan Markle marries Prince Harry, the Duchy of Cornwall will absorb the majority of her living costs associated with royal responsibilities, allowing her to retain most of her own money. Known as the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate has a significant influence on fashion trends worldwide. Although she does not directly benefit financially from the impact her designer clothes create, she has sparked what is known as ""the Kate Effect."""
gossipcop-3178847561,1,0,"Caitlyn Jenner told Diane Sawyer that she had undergone ""the final surgery"" in her gender reassignment procedures on Friday night's ""20/20"" special.  The former Olympian previously known as Bruce confirmed in her book ""The Secrets of My Life,"" coming out on Tuesday, that the 2017 ""surgery was a success.""  And Jenner said on the ABC interview, she had ""no regrets, none whatsoever.""  Beyond that, Jenner didn't want to talk about the details, telling Sawyer, ""I’m not going to dwell on that subject. It's not an appropriate question to ask a trans person.""  But nothing else was off-limits, as Sawyer caught up with Jenner nearly two years after the TV journalist had done their last emotional interview. Then, the ex-athlete stunned the world by revealing how he had lived a lie. Inside, ex-decathlon champ Jenner had always identified as a woman.  Since then, Jenner said she has been ""happy, peaceful…all of that confusion has left me….I did the right thing"" -- and doesn't miss ""Bruce"" a bit.  Sporting red nails and stylishly feminine clothing, Jenner recalled how—when he was still known as Bruce--he had put an instruction in his will: ""When I'm buried, I want to be dressed as her 'cause that's the way I'm going to heaven.""  As many know from her former reality show, ""I Am Cait,"" Jenner is a Republican and she confided to Sawyer, ""Yes, I did vote for Trump.""  Jenner was initially impressed with Trump for reaching out to transgender people at the Republican National Convention and noted, ""He wanted me to come play golf with him.""  But Jenner got upset when President Trump's administration revoked the federal guidelines that allowed public school students to use bathrooms corresponding to their gender identity--believing it's an issue best left to state and local authorities to decide.  ""It was extremely disappointing…you mess with my community, you don't give us equality and a fair shot, I'm coming after you,"" Jenner sighed about President Trump's decision.  Although Jenner has had her jawline, forehead, and breasts worked on, she insists she's always been a woman because what's important is ""what's between your ears.""  Jenner said she's fine with her ex-wife, Kris Jenner, and stays in touch with all her kids while they pursue their own lives.  ""Nobody calls that much. I reach out to them,"" commented the former ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians"" star.  Jenner told Sawyer that she has ""never been on a date"" in the two years since she came out as transgender, and doesn't really see dating in her future.  Instead, Jenner is most focused on helping the transgender community through charities and building awareness about discrimination and other issues.  ""I want to fight this fight,"" she vowed.  For more on Caitlyn Jenner, tune in to Tucker Carlson on Monday night for his exclusive interview with the star. It will be Carlson's first time in his new 8 p.m. EST slot.","Caitlyn Jenner revealed to Diane Sawyer during a ""20/20"" interview that she recently underwent ""the final surgery"" as part of her gender reassignment process. In her upcoming book, ""The Secrets of My Life,"" Jenner, formerly known as Bruce, confirms that the surgery was successful. Jenner expressed no regrets about her decision and stated that she didn't want to discuss the details, deeming it an inappropriate question for a transgender individual. Sawyer conducted this interview nearly two years after their previous emotional conversation, and Jenner shocked the world by admitting that she had been living a lie as Bruce and always identified as a woman. Jenner conveyed a sense of happiness, peace, and clarity since transitioning, and she expressed that she doesn't miss her former self. She recalled an instruction she included in her will to be buried as her true self. As a Republican and known from her reality show ""I Am Cait,"" Jenner admitted to voting for Trump due to his outreach towards transgender individuals during the Republican National Convention. However, she became upset when the administration revoked guidelines allowing transgender students to use bathrooms aligned with their gender identity, believing it should be a matter decided by local authorities. Jenner has undergone various cosmetic procedures but stated that what's crucial is self-identity rather than physical appearance. She maintains a good relationship with her ex-wife, Kris Jenner, and remains in contact with all her children. Although she has not been on a date since coming out as transgender, Jenner is focused on helping the transgender community through charitable work and advocating against discrimination. Lastly, an exclusive interview with Jenner will be on Tucker Carlson's upcoming show."

She’s hoping French gets to her before it’s too late.”  As HollywoodLife.com previously reported, it’s really hard for KoKo to ignore the rumors that TT and his baby mama, Jordy Craig, are still hooking up. In fact, we’re told Khloe’s hired some private eyes to keep tabs on her dude. “She loves Tristan wholeheartedly and he’s been nothing but a stand-up, loving man,” another source told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “But she can’t help but worry sometimes.

We’ve got the pics of their steamy Mexican getaway  Rihanna has kept her one year romance with Saudi billionaire Hassan Jameel super private. So when rumors surfaced in June that they had broken up fans were waiting to see proof they were still a couple. They got it on July 9 when pics surfaced of the 30-year-old singer and the businessman on a sexy Mexican getaway. The two appeared to be locked in a animated conversation as bikini clad RiRi is seen pointing her right index finger in the air with her mouth open, looking like she had something important to say. In another pic Hassan is seen looking back at her with his hand on his chest as if they’re involved in a somewhat heated conversation. CLICK HERE to see all the pics.  On June 1 MediaTakeOut claimed RiRi had dumped Hassan. The site reported that “Rihanna just got tired of him. She gets tired of men sometimes,” an alleged insider told them. They said that the handsome billionaire wasn’t doing too well after the split. “Of course Rihanna broke his heart. That’s what she does — break men’s hearts.” Since Rihanna has never commented on her romance with Hassan and goes to great lengths to keep their relationship away from the public eye, MTO’s report spread like wildfire.  Obviously something is still on between Rihanna and Hassan, as they are having a hot summer together. They were first photographed a year ago making out in a pool in Spain. They’ve only been pictured a handful of times since, keeping their love undercover. The “Work” singer’s previous relationship was with Drake, 31, and it played out in public. He even professed his years of love to her in front of the world while presenting her with the Video Vanguard award at the 2016 VMAs. After having the public know all about their dating business, Ri has wisely kept her romance with Hassan as far out of the public eye as possible.  Rihanna revealed recently that Drake gushing about her on live TV made her cringe. In a May 2018 interview with Vogue, she said “Waiting through that speech was probably the most uncomfortable part. I don’t like too many compliments; I don’t like to be put on blast.” As for where she stands with Drizzy, she told the mag that they haven’t spoken and that “We don’t have a friendship now, but we’re not enemies either. It is what it is.” However she did come the close to discussing her relationship with Hassan, telling the publication that she dating and she is happy. “I used to feel guilty about taking personal time,” she revealed, “but I also think I never met someone who was worth it before,” she said about her romance with Hassan.","Despite speculation about a breakup, Rihanna and her boyfriend Hassan Jameel are still together. The couple, who have been dating for a year, have managed to keep their relationship very private.

In one photo, Rihanna can be seen animatedly pointing her finger in the air while Hassan listens attentively. In another photo, Hassan appears to be engaged in a passionate discussion with Rihanna. While there were reports claiming that Rihanna had dumped Hassan, she has never publicly commented on their relationship and prefers to keep it away from the public eye. Their current summer getaway confirms that they are still together and enjoying their time as a couple. Rihanna's previous relationship with Drake was very public, but she has learned from that experience and has chosen to keep her romance with Hassan under wraps as much as possible. She recently stated that Drake's public declaration of love made her uncomfortable, and while she has no friendship with him now, they are also not enemies. As for Hassan, Rihanna has expressed that she is happy and dating someone who is worth her time."
gossipcop-6909849467,1,0,"Now, it’s official: Star Wars fans will have one final chance to say goodbye to Carrie Fisher, with Lucasfilm announcing that the actress, who died in December 2016, will appear in next year’s Star Wars: Episode IX.  In a statement, director J.J. Abrams sought to put concerns about potential CGI resurrections to rest, saying that the new movie will use “unseen footage we shot together in Episode VII” and assuring fans that “we were never going to recast, or use a CG character.” While this is, undoubtedly, comforting, it would also appear to offer particular clues about the role Fisher — or, more specifically, her character, Leia Organa — will play in the movie.  Firstly: Purely for practical purposes, Leia’s presence in the movie will be small. If nothing else, there can’t be that much extraneous, unseen footage from 2015's Star Wars: The Force Awakens; she was barely in that movie, so unless large swaths of scenes were shot but never even hinted at by anyone involved in the production, there’s limited material to draw from in the first place, and surely not everything available will be used.  Considering the context of the footage, it also limits the potential use for Episode IX. Leia appeared in few scenes and locations in The Force Awakens. Leia was on Takodana, rescuing Han, Chewbacca, Rey and Finn, and then at the Resistance base on D’Qar, where she takes part in planning, and later monitoring, the attack on Starkiller Base. Aside from brief interludes with Han and, later, Rey, she’s very much in “harried leader” mode throughout the movie. Does this mean that this is the Leia we’ll see in Episode IX, even after losing her ex-husband, and then her brother, in the previous two movies?  (It’s possible that the Fisher footage will end up being just a minor flashback, used to punctuate a contemporary moment; memories during her funeral, as some on social media have already suggested. If so, then the above problem is side-stepped, to a degree.)  Abrams’ comments leave space for some level of postproduction trickery to be applied to the Fisher footage. Presumably, Fisher will be intercut with new footage of actors shot specifically for Episode IX. Will digital trickery be used to make sure that Fisher shares a location with the other cast members? If so, will that be all that’s altered? What about costuming choices? For that matter, what about the potential for posthumous dubbing or soundalikes used for dialogue where Leia is off-camera or not in close-up? Abrams said that the movie would never use a CG character, but what about a performance augmented or altered by CG?  Of course, if any such edits or alterations are made, they’ll have to be done with subtlety and sensitivity. This is key to the entire enterprise of including footage of Fisher posthumously. For as much as fans want to be able to say goodbye to the actress, and also to Leia, they want to do so in a manner that feels appropriate and respectful to both. While Abrams and Lucasfilm — and Fisher’s family, especially daughter Billie Lourd, named in Abrams’ statement — want to provide both closure and tribute to Leia and Fisher alike with this move, they’re courting backlash if this isn’t done perfectly.  That the footage will come from The Force Awakens feels particularly fitting, then; that, after all, was a project that already came with expectations and looming accusations from fandom expecting the worst. It’s also perhaps a reminder that those involved with this move love the mythology — and loved Fisher as a person — as much as anyone else, if not more so, and will be approaching it with the utmost care.  Everyone will, inevitably, remain worried until the final product appears onscreen, but perhaps we can rest just slightly in the meantime.","Lucasfilm has officially announced that the late Carrie Fisher will make an appearance in the upcoming Star Wars: Episode IX, giving fans one last opportunity to bid farewell to the beloved actress. Director J.J. Abrams assured fans that the movie will utilize previously unseen footage of Fisher from Episode VII, debunking any concerns about CGI resurrections or recasting. However, given the limited amount of unused footage available, it is likely that Leia's role in the movie will be relatively small. The context of the footage suggests that Leia will continue to embody her role as a determined leader, despite the losses she has suffered in the previous films. There is speculation that the Fisher footage may be used in flashbacks or during funeral scenes, which would alleviate some of the challenges in incorporating her into the plot. Abrams' statement also raises questions about the extent of postproduction alterations that may be applied to the Fisher footage. While he emphasized the avoidance of computer-generated characters, it remains to be seen if certain modifications, such as digital trickery or posthumous dubbing, will be utilized. Nonetheless, any edits or alterations must be executed with subtlety and sensitivity to maintain the appropriate tone and respect for Fisher's legacy. The decision to source the footage from The Force Awakens is fitting, as it aligns with the project's pre-existing expectations and the careful handling of fan reactions. It also serves as a testament to the deep appreciation and affection that those involved in the production have for the Star Wars mythology and for Fisher herself. Although concerns will inevitably persist until the final product is revealed, there is some reassurance in the knowledge that the filmmakers are approaching this endeavor with the utmost care."

The talk show host on Sunday posted a photo on Instagram of him and his wife boarding a private jet.  “Vacation time is here, let’s go girl,” he captioned the Sunday, July 8 image.

She knows her man’s weakness — knows everything about him! That’s why she watches him so closely.”  The rumor was the talk of Twitter.  “Am I late??

A replica of the world’s most famous “unsinkable” ship — which struck an iceberg and sank on its maiden voyage on April 15, 1912, killing 1,503 people — is under construction, with a maiden voyage planned for 2018.  Australian tycoon and politician Clive Palmer — not J. Bruce Ismay — is at the helm of the ambitious project to faithfully recreate the luxury ship, which will be about 13 feet wider to meet current regulations.  More importantly, it will carry enough lifeboats for every passenger and its hull will be welded, not riveted, just in case it comes across a rogue iceberg, the Belfast Telegraph reports.  “The new Titanic will of course have modern evacuation procedures, satellite controls, digital navigation and radar systems and all those things you’d expect on a 21st-century ship,” James McDonald, global marketing director of Palmer’s company, Blue Star Line, told the paper.  The new nine-deck ship will be 885 feet long, about two more than her doomed predecessor, 174 feet high and have a maximum speed of 24 knots. She will accommodate 2,400 passengers — 177 more than the RMS Titanic.  It also will feature the same categories of passengers — from the first-class movers and shakers to the hoi polloi in third class, where poor Leonardo DiCaprio was berthed in the classic movie.  Unlike the Belfast-built original, the Titanic II is under construction by the CSC Jinling Shipyard in Jiangsu, China.  Its maiden voyage will not be from Southampton to New York, but rather from Jiangsu, China, to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, the paper reported.  Some of the dead passengers’ relatives have criticized the plans for a new Titanic, but Blue Star has reportedly been flooded with requests for tickets — with some offering up to about $900,000 for a spot on the first trip.","Titanic II, a faithful replica of the infamous ""unsinkable"" ship that tragically sank in 1912, is currently being constructed and is set to launch in 2018.

Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired. T","Katie Holmes is facing difficulties in her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise, and daughter Suri, according to numerous reports. RadarOnline claims that Holmes and Foxx were on the brink of getting married in an extravagant ceremony worth $300,000, with Suri as her bridesmaid. However, Foxx's commitment issues and his friendly relationship with his ex-girlfriend and mother of his daughter ultimately led to the cancellation of the wedding. Holmes felt disrespected by Foxx's behavior and realized it wasn't healthy for her or Suri. Additionally, Cruise has been trying to regain a presence in Suri's life, which Holmes is hesitant about due to her agreement for Cruise to stay away from their daughter and not involve her in the Church of Scientology. Holmes, however, is starting to consider a reunion for the sake of Suri's happiness. Despite denials from Holmes' representatives, it is significant that her publicist openly acknowledged their relationship, which they had tried to keep secret for years due to legal obligations from Holmes' divorce settlement with Cruise. Speculation arose when Holmes and Foxx were spotted together after the alleged five-year dating ban ended."
