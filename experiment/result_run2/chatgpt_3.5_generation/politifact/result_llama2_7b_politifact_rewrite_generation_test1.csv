PHEEEEEWWWW, that would have been too much to handle.Houston – It seems new National Rifle Association President (NRA) president Jim Porter may have found himself in a bit of hot water. Not long ago he made his feelings about the Civil War known when he referred to it as the “War of Northern Aggression.” In that same speech he referred to President Obama as a “fake president” and Attorney General Eric Holder as “rabidly un-American.” However none of those remarks that anyone could deem as racist compare to his remarks made at a recent press conference discussing his new leadership role at the NRA.“I’m very proud to be taking the lead here at the NRA. We need to really buckle down and strap on our best arguments to defend what is our God-given rights. No more northern folk tryin’ take away what is rightfully ours. I will not stand by and let some liberal-elitists try to ruin what has made this country great, especially a liberal of, you know, a different breed.”When asked to clarify Porter said,“I don’t have to clarify. You know gall darn well what I mean. In fact, it’s only a matter of time before we can own colored people again. They sure as hell won’t be our leaders. It’s out-right embarrassing. The War of Northern Aggression made it all possible, and you be best to know it’s all gonna change back. I’ll be on the front lines making sure it happens. I don’t want my grandkids growing up taking orders from a colored man. It’s our God-given right to keep them as property and keep them in line.”Several at the NRA, including vice president Wayne LaPierre, have since tried to distance themselves from Porter’s remarks. LaPierre said, “They brought him in over me to try and liven things up, calling me boring and rehearsed. Next time they’d be better off just making me president.”-- ADVERTISEMENT --It’s still unknown if the NRA and Porter will write an apology and retraction to his comments.

During a speech, he referred to the Civil War as the ""War of Northern Aggression"" and referred to President Obama as a ""fake president"" and Attorney General Eric Holder as ""rabidly un-American."" However, his most concerning remarks were made at a press conference, where he stated, ""We need to defend our God-given rights. No more northern folk trying to take away what is rightfully ours.

politifact15307,1,0,"Barack Obama has decided to spend his retirement years planning a coup against his own government. In the past two weeks, after receiving a...“NOS” stands for “Novus Ordo Seclorum,” or New World Order. The O has been replaced with a transformed version of Obama’s campaign slogan, with the American flag replaced by flames. There is also an all-seeing eye in the center. It’s pretty clear what the agenda is of this traitor we knew was an American-hating globalist all along:Along with two small islands due east of Virginia just in international waters, Obama’s “team” has now set up massive complexes with billions in equipment and spying technology outside of Washington DC, New York and Los Angeles. Chicago would have been a better choice for population than Washington but if your end game is to launch a military coup in the nation’s capital, those pieces must be deeply embedded in place.How embedded? Obama himself lives within the city limits. He conducts secret meetings with top-ranking officials from both parties and diplomats from around the world in a mansion that is a part of the old Washington tunnel system, built after the British trashed the city and burned down the White House in 1812.The extent of the tunnels is unknown since they remain the property of the US Government and require codeword clearance. There is no map available. Historians have pieced together several of the stops, however, and Tracey Place — along with just about every other building that houses a public official in DC — is on the list.This is no joke, patriots. If Obama’s military comes to your door in yellow Humvees with that emblem on them, they aren’t your friends. Get out of the house and don’t look back. At some point, their population reduction plan will go into effect and older Trump supporters will be the first ones buried in mass graves.","Former US President Barack Obama has been accused of planning a seditious act against his own government. According to reports, the Obama administration has been covertly establishing strategic complexes located outside of major cities and across two uninhabited islands, which has raised concerns among citizens and officials alike. It is believed that these facilities are outfitted with advanced technology and equipment for spying and surveillance. Moreover, there have been reports of secret meetings being held by Obama with high-ranking officials and diplomats from around the world, all within the confines of a hidden mansion known to be a part of the historic Washington tunnel system, allegedly built after the British burned down the White House in 1812. While the exact reach and extent of these tunnels is unknown, several sources have identified Tracey Place, among other buildings that house public officials in the area. If these reports are to be believed, Obama's coup is a serious threat to the security and integrity of the US government. Henceforth, it is necessary for citizens to remain vigilant and cautious of any suspicious yellow Humvees that may indicate the approach of the former president's military."

This time it was during the YouTube shooting reporting by local liberal news channels.As the media ran to drive a narrative home today after the Youtube headquarters shooting one San Francisco Bay Area resident and employee of YouTube decided to say what he was really thinking. Instead of saying the same old things someone from Liberal Silicon Valley would say he said that every red-blooded American should be thinking when caught up in a shootout.Witness at San Bruno YouTube headquarters shooting. “I didn’t have a gun on me but wish I did” pic.twitter.com/jP6v9uOlpa — ᏢᏒᎥsᏟᎥᏞᏞᎪ’s ᏉᎥᎬᎳ ™️ (@PriscillasView) April 3, 2018“When asked what was going through his mind, the witness stated, “I knew I had to be smart. You gotta be smart, you gotta be fast.”The witness also added, “I didn’t have a gun on me, but I wish I did.”He said he wished he had a gun. And that’s the way he should feel. And that’s what our founding fathers intended when they wrote the constitution. They wanted for us to live as free people and to never have to ask anyone permission when it came to owning a firearm. And no, they didn’t just mean muskets like you liberals keep trying to tell us. ‘Wow.. they will run this poor man out of looney California! — al_waisman (@al_waisman) April 4, 2018Reports are confirming that this particular shooting was just a disgruntled woman who wanted to kill her boyfriend, which would potentially make the event a case of domestic violence. And Law enforcement officials do not appear to be treating the incident as an act of terrorism. But what I would like to know is how this woman ended up with a gun.California is known for their strict gun control. We law abiding Californians have to just through hoops to buy a firearm. We eve have to wait 14 days to buy a .22lr bolt action rifle, not unlike the ones parents would gift their 12-year-old sons in the 50’s. Not to mention starting last year we will also need to get a permit, which cost $50 a year to buy ammo, and our ammo will be counted and have serial numbers. But nevermind the fact you can buy any gun for pennies on the dollar in some areas of Oakland and Stockton.I am sure once politicians ban all guns for us law-abiding gun owners, violent criminals will soon follow suit and also surrender their firearms… they just need the motivation to do so and maybe hug, that’s all.The shooter has now been identified via ABC 30SAN BRUNO, Calif. — Sources confirm to our sister station ABC7 News, that the YouTube shooter was a user of the platform. Nasim Aghdam has an alleged website with a manifesto that targets YouTube for censorship and demonetization of her video content.Aghdam is said to have no relationship with anyone in the YouTube facility.Sources say Aghdam did not have an ID badge but was carrying a purse. Nobody in the facility knew who she was. They added that Aghdam got off 30 or 40 shots before turning the gun on herself.According to her website, a possible motivation for the shooting could have been tied to her many YouTube accounts, which she says have seen a decline in viewership over the past few months.Police and witnesses say a woman opened fire Tuesday at YouTube headquarters in San Bruno, wounding three people before fatally shooting herself as terrified employees huddled inside.She embedded videos from the biggest YouTubers on the platform on the site, including massive creator Casey Neistat. In them, they talk about the YouTube “Ad-apocalypse” where many users are seeing massive dips in traffic, subscriber count loss, and de-monetization of videos.Neistat has more than 9,000,000 subscribers and made a famous video about the YouTube ad revenue scare for creators.It appears that Aghdam was disgruntled by the changes in the YouTube platform. She wrote on her website, “Be aware! Dictatorship exists in all countries but with different tactics! They only care for personal and short-term pr","During the recent reporting of the shooting at YouTube headquarters, some liberal news channels fell short of journalistic integrity. While many media outlets focused on driving a narrative, a San Francisco Bay Area resident and employee of YouTube spoke truthfully about his thoughts during the incident. When asked what was going through his mind, the witness stated, “I knew I had to be smart. You gotta be smart, you gotta be fast.” The witness also expressed his desire to have a gun, a sentiment that aligns with the constitutional right to bear arms and the intention of our founding fathers.

Reports now confirm that the shooting was a case of domestic violence, and law enforcement officials do not consider it an act of terrorism. However, the question remains about how this woman obtained a gun. California is notably strict in its gun control laws, causing law-abiding citizens to jump through hoops and wait extended periods to purchase firearms, and recently added a permit requirement for purchasing ammunition. Although politicians may believe that banning guns will stop violent criminals from possessing them, the reality is that firearms can be easily obtained in certain areas of the state.

The YouTube shooter has been identified as Nasim Aghdam, a user of the platform who allegedly targeted YouTube for censorship and demonetization of her video content. Aghdam had no relationship with anyone at the YouTube facility and got off 30 or 40 shots before turning the gun on herself. A possible motivation for the shooting was Aghdam’s frustration with changes to YouTube’s platform, which led to declines in viewership and monetization for her content. While Aghdam’s actions were deplorable, her comments about the existence of dictatorship tactics resonate with those who value the principles of free speech and individual liberty."

politifact14356,1,0,"Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedInGretchen Carlson is renewing her push for an AR-15 ban, firing off a series a tweets further criticizing AR-15. Breitbart News reported that Carlson said that AR-15s are not needed to “hunt or kill deer” and suggested they only serve to enable terrorists to carry out their attacks with greater efficiency. She quoted a December 2015 poll showing majority support for an “assault weapons” ban and said, “I’m with the majority today, taking a stand.”Interestingly, when confronted by Second Amendment supporters on Twitter, Carlson doubled down on her pro-ban stance, claiming that “the fact that you’re even using the Second Amendment as an argument against banning assault weapons shows me you’re ignorant. Don’t you know the 2nd Amendment was written before guns were even invented?”Asked to comment on her tweets, Carlson told Breitbart News that “at one point, I even asked myself what was the use of trying to prove why assault rifles are bad to these people when they clearly don’t possess the most fundamental knowledge of history? I felt like I was trying to teach nuclear physics to someone who’s illiterate. I mean, we have Google and the Internet today. How hard was it to Google ‘the 2nd Amendment of the Constitution of the United States?’ I mean, really.”“And what worried me even more,” she continued, “was the fact that it seemed like every single person that replied to my tweet was under the impression that they were right and I was wrong. So, I’m sitting there, thinking, ‘Ooookaaay, someone obviously wasn’t paying attention during history class – a lot of someones, apparently – hmm, they must have been distracted by thinking about how they were off emptying 30 rounds into some innocent animal.’”Carlson also added, “I mean, I know the education in our country isn’t the best in the world, but I figured we’d at least be able to each our kids the basics like math and history. But, I guess I was wrong. What’s the next thing I’m going to hear, that we somehow went to the Moon and that Elvis Presley is dead? Come on, I’m not buying it.”“Like, I can understand about the Second Amendment and maybe something else that happened way, way back, but the King being dead? I really don’t know who would believe that. Just last night I saw him on YouTube. You know YouTube? He was performing in Vegas and there were thousands of bearded and longhaired men in the audience, so it must have been a beard convention or something. I swear, sometimes I don’t believe how stupid Americans can be,” she said.","Gretchen Carlson has reiterated her call for a ban on the AR-15, using a series of tweets to criticize the weapon. Carlson argued that the rifle is unnecessary for hunting and merely serves to aid terrorists in their attacks. She also highlighted a poll from December 2015 that suggests most Americans support a ban on so-called ""assault weapons."" Despite facing opposition from Second Amendment supporters on social media, Carlson remained steadfast in her position, claiming that those who cited the Second Amendment in defence of the AR-15 were ignorant of the historical context of the right to bear arms. Speaking to Breitbart News, Carlson expressed concern that some Americans appeared to lack even basic knowledge of US history or the content of the Constitution. She also lamented the state of education in the country, suggesting that poor knowledge of fundamental subjects like math and history could have negative consequences."

politifact13887,1,0,"Brian Kline is the type of person who voted for President Donald Trump in November. He’s a working-class man whose job is in retail, scoring him $11.66/hour. Thanks to Medicaid he’s being treated for cancer. During the CNN town hall with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, Kline explained his situation and his struggles. “My question is pretty straightforward,” Kline told Price. “Why do you want to take away my Medicaid expansion?” Price’s dispassionate answer seemed to fall flat on the audience. “I took care of a lot of patients with cancer,” Price explained about his 20 years as an orthopedic surgeon. “We don’t want to take care away from anybody. What we want to make certain, though, is that every single American has access to the kind of coverage and care that they want for themselves.”“But, what if there are people out there who are going to die more quickly because of what you’re doing here, because you’re essentially taking medical care away from people who need it the most?” Kline wouldn’t back down. “Are you saying you actually want people to be okay with that?” Price thought for a second, then replied: “Look, I understand how all of this sounds right now, but you know, there comes a time in everyone’s life when they just have to stop talking B.S. and be practical. As of right now, the fact to the matter is, our national budget is hemorrhaging money because of Obamacare. And believe me – I get how insensitive that sounds, but at the end of the day, we have to stop ignoring the facts here.”He continued, “I understand that this is not something anyone wants to hear, especially people who’ve got worse problems to deal with than the state of the national budget, but this is one of those situations where the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. When President Trump assumed office, he was appalled at the state of the national budget and our finances. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that Barack Obama was to blame, since he’s the one who left the hot potato behind for us to deal with. Now, I’m not going to go into whether or not he did that on purpose, but at the end of the day, all I can say is, we have to fix the problem or else we’re looking at nationwide riots and another economic recession.”“Put simply, we have to plug some holes – of which, by the way, there are plenty – and we kind of have to start with the biggest ones,” the orthopedic surgeon added. “Unfortunately for millions of people across the country, Obamacare seems to be the biggest one by far. Besides, there are more ways than one to look at this picture. I know it’s not pretty, but at the end of the day, even people who are able to fight off cancer – I’m sure you know what I’m talking about, Brian – they can’t lead 100 percent normal lives, ever again. What kind of an existence is that, to have to survive instead of live?”“At the risk of sounding insensitive, we’ve pretty much got two choices here: we either repeal Obamacare, or we take out more loans from countries like China. And nobody wants to be in debt to the Chinese. At the end of the day, it’s better for our national budget if cancer patients pass away more quickly, it’s a lousy way to live anyway, and I’m sorry to say it out loud, but it’s the truth,” Price concluded.","Brian Kline, a working-class man who voted for President Donald Trump, is currently undergoing treatment for cancer courtesy of Medicaid. During a CNN town hall with Tom Price, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Kline questioned the potential withdrawal of his Medicaid expansion. Price responded by acknowledging the importance of every American having access to appropriate healthcare. However, the national budget has been hemorrhaging money due to the costs of Obamacare. Price emphasized that it is time to be practical, and that fixing the national budget is crucial to prevent economic recession. In this difficult situation, the needs of the many outweigh those of the few. While this approach may initially sound insensitive, there are no realistic alternatives. To continue providing insurance to those with pre-existing conditions would only lead to nationwide debt, which the government is not prepared to accept. Furthermore, even after their successful fight with cancer, individuals often struggle to lead normal lives. In the absence of a more feasible solution, the repeal of Obamacare may be the only way forward."

While some Republican leaders have expressed their opposition to the idea of banning an American corporation, President Trump remains firm in his support for the ban as a way to combat the spread of fake news on social media platforms. ""The governance of a nation often involves making difficult decisions,"" explained President Trump. Despite Facebook's efforts to combat fake news, a substantial amount of false information continues to circulate on the platform. Although Twitter and Instagram are exempt from this potential ban, insiders at Facebook are dissatisfied with this selective exclusion. Rick Rowlinson, a source from Facebook, expressed his concern that the President's commitment to tackling fake news should not be limited to one company. In response to the proposed ban, a number of Californians have already taken to the streets in protest.  

It is important to note that courts in the US have previously blocked President Trump's travel ban executive order. However, Vice President Mike Pence has pledged his support for the ban on Facebook if it is enacted. Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, has said that his company will continue to operate from California, even if it is banned in the US. He argues that an outright ban is not the most effective way to combat false news. Lastly, employees of Facebook are planning to start a signature campaign against the order if it is approved. With concerns being raised about social media elsewhere in the world, including in Pakistan where legal action has been considered for 'blasphemous content', the potential for the US to join this list is a possibility. It remains to be seen how this will unfold, but Donald Trump's remarks, and Zuckerberg's response, have already gone viral."

Tyranny has officially taken hold on American soil.This sets a precedent that government can now forcefully take guns away from an individual without a crime being committed or an arrest being made and without a warrant. In the name of fear and political exploitation of anti-gun rhetoric, a citizen’s Second Amendment rights have been ripped away from him by the government.The new “red flag” law, which has taken hold in other states already, allows the courts and law enforcement to take away guns from individuals they deem are dangerous and they’ve just begun the confiscation.

The confiscation is legal under new “red flag” laws, which allow law enforcement to remove firearms from individuals deemed dangerous by the courts. However, this man was not arrested or charged with a crime, and was not brandishing his weapon - he was open carrying, which is legal in the area. While some neighbors complained that the man's behavior made them feel unsafe, he was in compliance with the law.

politifact14126,1,0,"Breaking News: FBI Uncovers Evidence That 62 Million Trump Voters are All Russian AgentsAnonymous sources within the FBI have revealed to The Times that they have new evidence indicating that everyone who voted for Donald Trump is an agent of the FSB (formerly the KGB). An unknown portion of these voters may have had their minds controlled by a Russian space-beam, agents close to the investigation say.The allegation that 62 million Americans appear to be employed by Russian intelligence services has rocked the Bureau, and it is reported that multiple agents have taken their own lives, given that realizing just how deep this Russian hacking conspiracy runs blew their minds — literally.This shocking new revelation comes after it was confirmed as a fact that Russia did Wikileaks because Donald Trump personally called Vladimir Putin and asked him to. It was also revealed earlier this week that Alex Jones (real name “Alexi Jonesinov”) is a Russian sleeper agent who was ordered by the FSB (formerly the KGB) to post news articles on the internet saying that Donald Trump would be a good President.However, the revelation that 62 million Americans are taking orders directly from the Kremlin is a revelation of a whole other order, which FBI agents are struggling with how to deal with.It was determined by Puerto Rican federal judge Mizu Tomazaki that it is a crime to support Donald Trump or to post positive things about him on the internet. 9th circuit judges Weinberg, Steinman and Goldenstein upheld the ruling. Despite this, the logistics of rounding up 62 million people and locking them in prison present a difficult task to overcome.It may also be that not every voter is a direct agent of the FSB (formerly the KGB), and some may have been under the control of a mind control beam in space.“We have not determined for sure that everyone who voted for Trump was paid directly by the Kremlin, given that it is highly possible that the Russians used a space-beam from a satellite to control their brains from a facility in St. Petersburg, and moved their bodies like puppets to the polls to check the Trump box,” one current agent familiar with the investigation told the times, describing the process of using a satellite-mounted space-beam to control people’s actions as “Russian neuro-brain hacking.”When asked for comment on these reports by The Times, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the allegations of space-beam mind control by the FSB (formerly the KGB) were “ridiculous,” “outrageous” and “goofy.” However, Peskov suspiciously asked “vere is Moose and Squirrel?”NSA chief Mike Rogers said that though it is a well-established fact that going all the way back to Soviet times, the Russians have used space-beams to control people’s brains, he’s “never seen anything on this scale before.”The Times also sought comment from President Trump; however, when asked about these allegations, he began screaming in Russian and jumped in a big truck and drove off down the road.You are all nuts…almost 1/2 of America voted to make Trump the legal president, and you keep teling us we don’t matter. Install Hillary by force or some other act of politics, and you will have a civil war on your hands. And just in case you haven’t noticed, Trump’s people have most of the guns.","The FBI has reportedly uncovered new evidence, based on anonymous sources, which suggests that every person who voted for Donald Trump is an operative for the FSB, formerly known as the KGB, Russian intelligence services. The agents purport to believe that an unknown proportion of these voters might have had their minds controlled by a Russian space-beam. The enormity of the conspiracy has taken a significant toll on the Bureau, with some agents apparently committing suicide, according to some reports. US courts have ruled that it is a crime to support Trump on any public platform, but the logistical difficulties of incarcerating 62 million people, if every Trump supporter is indeed an alleged Russian agent, have yet to be worked out. Some FBI agents have speculated that the mind control was not delivered to voters directly by the Kremlin, but through the use of space-beams manipulating voter behaviour from a facility in St. Petersburg, which is described as ‘Russian neuro-brain hacking’. Although Kremlin officials deny the allegations, the NSA chief, Mike Rogers, stated that he had never seen anything on this scale before."
politifact15031,1,0,"Four million people dropped off the food stamp rolls in one month, according to the latest numbers on food stamp enrollment from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).The latest USDA data show that the number of participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the government program that administers food stamps, dropped from 45,666,795 in October 2017 to 41,658,868 in November 2017 — a staggering decrease of 4,007,927 over one month.Even though there was a temporary spike in enrollment, mostly concentrated in a few states that caused the national average of food stamp enrollment to spike, nationwide enrollment in the program as a whole is still on a steady decline.Enrollment in the program sharply increased by 3.5 million during the first month of fiscal year (FY) 2018 (October 2017) mostly due to heavy increases in temporary SNAP enrollment in hurricane-affected states such as Florida and Texas.In Florida alone, food stamp participation soared by 2.5 million from September to October due to the state administering Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (D-SNAP) benefits to poor residents affected by Hurricane Irma.The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service approved Florida’s request to administer these special D-SNAP benefits beginning September 10, 2017.A spokesperson for Florida’s Department of Children and Families (DCF) — the program that administers food stamp benefits in Florida — confirmed with Breitbart News that the dramatic increase in SNAP enrollment in the state was due to disaster relief, but that most food stamp recipients were not normal beneficiaries of the food stamp program.“The dramatic increase in SNAP recipients in the fall was related to the state’s administration of the federal disaster SNAP program following the impact of Hurricane Irma. To qualify for the federal disaster food assistance program, individuals must have lived or worked in one of the 48 declared counties on September 5, and NOT be a customer in the regular food assistance program,” said DCF Communications Director Jessica Sims.Sims added that DCF handed out D-SNAP benefits totaling more than $1 billion to 3.1 million people in the months following Hurricane Irma, but the state curtailed its D-SNAP benefit program on December 3.The sharp decline in food stamp enrollment over one month reflects how states like Florida have curtailed their temporary food stamp benefit programs for those affected by natural disasters.But it also highlights an ongoing downward trend in food stamp enrollment that has been going on for several years since state legislatures enacted welfare reform measures designed to get people back into the workforce.The Trump administration announced that it would adopt some of these state welfare reform measures — such as requiring food stamp recipients to work a certain number of hours per week — and implement them at the federal level, causing nationwide food stamp enrollment to plunge even further.Over the past year since President Donald Trump took office, enrollment in SNAP dropped by two million. The latest food stamp numbers show that the downward trend over the past year — and every year after 2013 — is continuing.","According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the most recent numbers on food stamp enrollment reveal that approximately four million people dropped off the food stamp rolls in a single month. This staggering decline in beneficiaries of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which administers food stamps, saw the number of participants decrease from 45,666,795 in October 2017 to 41,658,868 in November 2017 - a decrease of 4,007,927 in just one month. Although a short-term increase in enrollment occurred in certain states due to natural disasters, the nationwide trend in food stamp enrollment is continuously declining, which began after state legislatures enacted welfare reform measures designed to return people to the workforce. The Trump administration followed suit by implementing similar measures such as requiring food stamp recipients to work a specific number of hours per week, thus causing nationwide enrollment in the SNAP program to drop even further. In the past year alone, enrollment in SNAP has dropped by two million, with the downward trend continuing since 2013."

politifact13731,1,0,"Living in regular-sized homes with plenty of space for closets, lockers and shelves gives us little need to think about storage space. In tiny homes, space comes at a premium so storage space is one of the key issues that a tiny house owner will have to plan for when building, buying or furnishing their home. There is only so much we can downsize by moving to a tiny home, so planning for storage space is an integral part of preparation for tiny living.VerticalityTiny houses for sale in Florida have tiny floor plans. There is only so much space to put things on the floor, and once bare necessities such as beds, kitchen elements etc. are taken care of, there is little space left to put all of our stuff. Verticality is key in these situations. Wall-mounted shelving is excellent for organizing your stuff and it doesn’t demand a single inch of your floor. They are also quite inexpensive and easy to install. Instead of having an entertainment center, it is now easy to mount your TV and speakers on the wall, leaving more space for things you can’t compromise with.Multi-functional FurnitureIn a tiny house, a bed doesn’t have the luxury to be just a bed. It needs to perform multiple functions, where storage is one of the most important ones. The same applies to coffee and night tables, sofas and kitchen elements. Beds can have drawers for your linens, or room for storage under their mattress. Instead of a regular coffee table, opt in for a cube design, where multiple storage drawers are integrated for all those small things you don’t have space for.Customized FurnitureSometimes it is difficult to furnish a tiny home, especially if it doesn’t use a standard floor plan. Customized furniture is a huge advantage in tiny homes, where space is at a premium. You can make sure that every single corner and nook of your house can be used in a functional way. The same applies to storage. A well-placed shelf or locker, can perform a very important function while not taking up much space or by utilizing and otherwise unused space. Customized furniture does come at a premium price, but it is one of those investments you will not lose any sleep over once you are living in your tiny home.Tiny AppliancesEvery piece of furniture and appliance you put into your tiny home, will make you compromise on something else. Tiny living is about downsizing your living space to bare necessities but that has a different meaning for different people. In order to create more space for storing stuff you can’t live without, making some sacrifices when it comes to appliances is important. Instead of a full-sized stove, opt in for a dual heat-plate design that will take up less space. A small refrigerator works fine, just like a large two-door model. Also shopping more frequently for fresh groceries will lead you to a healthier lifestyle and diet. A fold out dinning-table in the kitchen, saves you the space that you might need for a dining table. Tiny appliances and gadgets do tend to have a higher price than standard ones, but they provide so much more than function to tiny home dwellers.","Living in a regular-sized home with ample space for storage may not require much thought on the topic, however, in the realm of tiny homes, storage space is an essential consideration for any future resident. The restriction on space challenged tiny house owners to carefully plan and prepare when constructing, purchasing, or furnishing their home. Simply moving to a smaller residence does not mean one can sacrifice adequate storage space. 

For small homes on the market in Florida, the floor plan is limited, leaving little room to place items on the ground. Homeowners must consider verticality, as wall-mounted shelves provide an excellent solution for storage without sacrificing precious floor space. Furthermore, wall-mounted entertainment systems save valuable space and are easily installed. 

Multi-functional furniture is critical in a tiny house, where a bed should not merely serve as a place to sleep but fulfill other functions, particularly storage. Coffee and night tables, sofas, and kitchen elements must also perform multiple uses, including storage. Incorporating drawers and utilizing the space beneath a mattress provides valuable storage space. It is wise to choose cube-design tables, which integrate storage drawers for small items with no place to go. 

Furnishing a tiny home may present difficulties, particularly when it deviates from a standard floor plan. Customized furniture provides a significant advantage in tiny homes where space is at a premium. Every nook and cranny can be utilized with the proper placement of shelves and lockers, providing crucial functions without requiring much space. Though customized furniture may come at a premium price point, it is a sound investment for those living in tiny homes.

Every appliance and piece of furniture has the potential to limit precious space and require compromise. In order not to sacrifice storing personal items, residents must acknowledge the importance of downsizing. A dual heat-plate stove serves a similar function as a full-sized one and takes up less space, while a small refrigerator provides ample storage for grocery essentials. To avoid requiring a dining table, a kitchen featuring a fold-out dining table offers a creative solution to save space. Although tiny appliances may be more expensive than standard ones, they offer many benefits to those residing in tiny homes."

In an emergency meeting on Thursday, the city council held an emergency meeting to initiate impeachment proceedings which begin on Monday.Donald Trump has helped Puerto Rico and other hurricane-affected areas much more efficiently than any previous President, and Puerto Rico needs to replace their leadership with someone who understands and appreciates that before they lose the aid we aren’t even required to give them.","The potential end to aid towards Puerto Rico has caused the city’s leaders to take action. Despite Governor Ricardo Rosselló commending President Donald Trump for his efforts, the distribution of crucial supplies in San Juan has been sparse, according to Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz. The explanation provided by Mayor Cruz was unsatisfactory for her colleagues, leading the city council to convene an emergency meeting aimed at beginning impeachment proceedings scheduled for Monday. It is essential that Puerto Rico recognizes the efforts extended to them by President Trump to recover from Hurricane Maria and replace their leadership with someone who can appreciate and understand their needs, else risk losing the aid provided by the country."
politifact14128,1,0,"Workers in New Orleans dismantled the city’s Jefferson Davis monument early Thursday, removing the prominent statue of the Confederate leader that had stood for more than 100 years.As workers slung a strap around the statue’s waist and lifted it off its pedestal, at least 100 people cheered from across the street, outnumbering the few dozen protesters of the removal, some waving Confederate flags.“This historic moment is an opportunity to join together as one city and redefine our future,” Mayor Mitch Landrieu said as he announced that crews had begun removing the statue, the second of four planned removals of Confederacy-related monuments.The Mayor also made an announcement that the statue would be replaced with a bronze statue of the 44th President Barack Obama.“It will be nice”, Landrieu said, “to see a monument to our first African-American President in the same spot that used to be a place to memorialize old racist White privilege.”The Obama statue will be patterned after one erected in Kenya last year and will reportedly cost the Louisana taxpayers an estimated $800,000 dollars.Like an earlier removal, this one was performed in the dark because of death threats against city officials and contractors.Beaureguard Billy-Bob Johnson, one of the leaders of the opposition was outraged by not only the statue being taken down but the fact that it occurred in the middle of the night.“We would have preferred it to be in the daytime,” Johnson said, “so everybody could see what they are doing the light of day. And I really hate coming downtown at night with all the darkies afoot and everything.”Before the monument could be removed, police had to clear the immediate area of demonstrators — both supporters of the monuments and those who want them taken away. Barricades were used to keep the sides separated, NOLA.com reported. The news outlet said chants by monument supporters included “Where’s Mitch?” while opponents chanted, “Hey hey, ho ho, white supremacy has got to go.”As Fox news reported earlier, the mayor’s plan calls for the Davis statue to be melted down and cast into smaller statues of Black Lives Matter leaders.","The city of New Orleans saw an important moment on Thursday morning as workers dismantled the Jefferson Davis monument, which had been a prominent statue of the Confederate leader for more than a century. As the statue was carefully lifted from its pedestal, a group of around one hundred people cheered from across the street and outnumbered the few dozen protestors of the removal, some of whom waved Confederate flags.

Mayor Mitch Landrieu saw this as an historic moment, and spoke to those gathered about the need to see it as an opportunity to redefine the city’s future. This removal marks the second of four planned removals of Confederacy-related monuments, and sets a precedent for future action.

One aspect of this new direction is the decision to replace the Davis statue with one of former President Barack Obama, a bronze statue that will cost the state an estimated $800,000. Landrieu has stated that this decision will serve to replace a monument to racist white privilege with one that honors the first African-American president of the United States.

Despite the importance of this moment, there were some in opposition to the removal and the way in which it was accomplished.

politifact15280,1,0,"A leaked Hillary Clinton email confirms that the Obama administration, with Hillary at the helm, orchestrated a civil war in Syria to benefit Israel.The new Wikileaks release shows the then Secretary of State ordering a war in Syria in order to overthrow the government and oust President Assad, claiming it was the “best way to help Israel”.Newobserveronline.com reports:The document was one of many unclassified by the US Department of State under case number F-2014-20439, Doc No. C05794498, following the uproar over Clinton’s private email server kept at her house while she served as Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013.Although the Wikileaks transcript dates the email as December 31, 2000, this is an error on their part, as the contents of the email (in particular the reference to May 2012 talks between Iran and the west over its nuclear program in Istanbul) show that the email was in fact sent on December 31, 2012.The email makes it clear that it has been US policy from the very beginning to violently overthrow the Syrian government—and specifically to do this because it is in Israel’s interests.“The best way to help Israel deal with Iran’s growing nuclear capability is to help the people of Syria overthrow the regime of Bashar Assad,” Clinton forthrightly starts off by saying.Even though all US intelligence reports had long dismissed Iran’s “atom bomb” program as a hoax (a conclusion supported by the International Atomic Energy Agency), Clinton continues to use these lies to “justify” destroying Syria in the name of Israel.She specifically links Iran’s mythical atom bomb program to Syria because, she says, Iran’s “atom bomb” program threatens Israel’s “monopoly” on nuclear weapons in the Middle East.If Iran were to acquire a nuclear weapon, Clinton asserts, this would allow Syria (and other “adversaries of Israel” such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt) to “go nuclear as well,” all of which would threaten Israel’s interests.Therefore, Clinton, says, Syria has to be destroyed.Iran’s nuclear program and Syria’s civil war may seem unconnected, but they are. What Israeli military leaders really worry about — but cannot talk about — is losing their nuclear monopoly.An Iranian nuclear weapons capability would not only end that nuclear monopoly but could also prompt other adversaries, like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, to go nuclear as well. The result would be a precarious nuclear balance in which Israel could not respond to provocations with conventional military strikes on Syria and Lebanon, as it can today.If Iran were to reach the threshold of a nuclear weapons state, Tehran would find it much easier to call on its allies in Syria and Hezbollah to strike Israel, knowing that its nuclear weapons would serve as a deterrent to Israel responding against Iran itself.It is, Clinton continues, the “strategic relationship between Iran and the regime of Bashar Assad in Syria” that makes it possible for Iran to undermine Israel’s security.This would not come about through a “direct attack,” Clinton admits, because “in the thirty years of hostility between Iran and Israel” this has never occurred, but through its alleged “proxies.”The end of the Assad regime would end this dangerous alliance. Israel’s leadership understands well why defeating Assad is now in its interests.Bringing down Assad would not only be a massive boon to Israel’s security, it would also ease Israel’s understandable fear of losing its nuclear monopoly.Then, Israel and the United States might be able to develop a common view of when the Iranian program is so dangerous that military action could be warranted.Clinton goes on to asset that directly threatening Bashar Assad “and his family” with violence is the “right thing” to do:In short, the White House can ease the tension that has developed with Israel over Iran by doing the right thing in Syria.With his life and his family at risk, only the threat or use of force will change the Syrian dictator Bashar Assad’s mind.The email prov","ides evidence to support the claim that the United States, under the leadership of Hillary Clinton, orchestrated a civil war in Syria to benefit Israel. This information was leaked via an email which had been unclassified by the US Department of State, under case number F-2014-20439, Doc No. C05794498, following controversy over Clinton’s private email server usage during her tenure as Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013. Although the email as transcribed by Wikileaks dates the message as December 31, 2000, this is an error as its content, particularly the mention of the May 2012 Iran-west talks about the nuclear program in Istanbul, indicates that it was sent on December 31, 2012. 

The email largely discusses how the US had the long-standing policy of overthrowing the Syrian government and deposing President Bashar Assad, with Clinton insisting that this was in the interest of Israel. According to her, it was the best way to help Israel deal with Iran’s perceived nuclear program threat, even though all US intelligence reports had long dismissed the idea of Iran having atomic bombs as a hoax, a conclusion also backed by the International Atomic Energy Agency.

Clinton further connects Iran’s purported nuclear program with Israel’s concern that its monopoly on nuclear weapons in the Middle East could be threatened. She notes that if Iran were to acquire nuclear weapons, a precarious nuclear balance would emerge in the region, making it difficult for Israel to respond to provocations with conventional military strikes on Syria and Lebanon. It would also become easier for Iran to call on its supposed allies in Syria and Hezbollah to attack Israel, as its nuclear weapons would act as a deterrent against Israeli retaliation.

Clinton posits that the “strategic relationship between Iran and the regime of Bashar Assad in Syria” made it possible for Iran to potentially undermine Israel’s security not through a direct attack, but using its proxies. She asserts that bringing down Assad would end this dangerous alliance and also ease Israel’s fear of losing its nuclear monopoly, thus allowing Israel and the US to agree on when the Iranian nuclear program reached a dangerous level.

Clinton concludes by stating that directly threatening Assad and his family with violence is the right thing to do, as it is the only way to change his mind and end the conflict. She suggests that this action would not only benefit Israel’s security but also assist in easing the mounting tension that had arisen with Israel over Iran. 

Overall, the email provides a clear window into the US policymakers’ thinking on Syria and Israel. While the language used may be provocative, it reflects a serious and measured attempt at assessing the region’s chain reaction to various scenarios."

The campaign has said they will be delighted to accept the donation and will use the ranch as a command center for the entire Pacific Northwest:“We’ll be able to sit up there, far from the prying eyes of Obama and the deep state and the deep levels of corruption still inside the Justice department and FBI, and strategize without worrying about being called before a federal prosecutor for it.”Clint Eastwood will be remembered for a lot of things after he’s gone, but this may be the biggest. Thanks for a lifetime of entertaining us, Clint!","Renowned actor Clint Eastwood has recently revealed that he has been informed by his doctors to put his affairs in order and prepare for his final journey, indicating that his health is deteriorating. At 89 years of age, the actor is not optimistic about surviving the coming year and fears that he may be among those remembered at the awards show next year. Eastwood, known for his sense of humour, laments that people still associate him with the empty chair stunt, a topic he wishes would be forgotten.

Eastwood asserts that he has successfully provided for his family by setting up trust funds, owning properties and purchasing large insurance policies. He has also voiced his wish to donate his personal estate to a more significant cause, namely to President Trump's 2020 campaign. This contribution includes his expansive Northern California ranch, 40,000 acres of grazing land in Nevada, and over $7 million in cash and other assets. The campaign has been grateful for Eastwood's generosity and has announced plans to use the ranch as a command centre for the Pacific Northwest. This approach has the added benefit of taking strategic discussions far from the eyes of corrupt political forces who still hold considerable influence in America.

The loss of Clint Eastwood will be felt by many upon his eventual passing. However, it is staggering to appreciate that his greatest legacy may be his philanthropy towards what he sees as a worthwhile cause. Clint has given viewers a lifetime of memorable performances, and now with the present announcement, he is hoping to continue to impact society beyond life as we know it."

politifact15224,1,1,"BREAKING: Barack Obama just secretly fled the U.S. after Donald Trump found some disturbing criminal evidence he left behind in the Oval Office. This prompted Trump to send a massive warning to Obama and his deep state minions that they won’t soon forget!Mad World News reported that Obama just jetted off to New Zealand this week, and he immediately imposed a strict ban on the media covering the events he plans to hold there. It should come as no surprise that Obama chose to leave the country right now, however, as the heat was just turned up on his deep state after the firing of now former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.In the wake of this firing, it was confirmed that Obama left behind a trail of damning evidence inside the Oval Office. The evidence proves that it was actually the Obama administration that colluded with Russia to thwart then-candidate Donald Trump during the presidential election, and they didn’t cover their tracks well enough.The members of Obama’s deep state that took part in this plan included ormer FBI Director James Comey, former National Security Advisor Susan Rice, former UN Ambassador Samantha Powers, and Lisa Monaco, who was the head of the DOJ National Security Division. Monaco slipped up and left an evidence trail going from the illegal unmasking of US citizens being done, Trump and his campaign people, under the illegal FISA warrants, back to the Oval Office via the “Presidential Daily Briefings” (PDB).“During the 2015/2016 presidential election, Lisa Monaco was one of the key WH figures doing the unmasking of raw intelligence provided by the ‘small group’ collaborators (with Susan Rice, Ben Rhodes). Monaco was also one of the key policy strategists, heck, she was the architect, who utilized the compartmentalization of intelligence to hide the fingerprints of collaboration. This was the issue that initially stymied HSPCI Devin Nunes,” reported The Conservative Treehouse.Nunes eventually found Obama’s PDBs which have all the illegal FISA activity and other illegal spy games targeting Trump.“Nunes stated the intelligence product he reviewed was ‘not related to Russia, or the FBI Russian counter-intelligence investigation.’ So the product itself was likely a product for the President, that was not part of the ongoing FBI counter-intel product,” reported The Conservative Treehouse.These PDBs prove Obama was in on this from the very beginning, and he hasn’t stopped trying to take Trump down since then. Last month, Obama and his deep state set up a website called “National Security Action,” who says their mission is, “Under President Trump’s reckless leadership, the United States is weaker in the world, less safe, and more isolated. He is retreating from the world stage, undercutting the intelligence and law enforcement agencies that keep us safe, undermining the diplomacy that prevents wars, insulting our allies, attacking democratic traditions, and cozying up to dictators while abandoning America’s commitment to universal rights and human dignity.”These people are just trying to get Trump impeached so they can swoop in and take back the White House as soon as he is out of it. Unfortunately for them, however, McCabe’s firing makes it clear that they won’t get away with this act of treason.What do you think about this?

Informed Reddit user, 1tch, has done an extensive analysis and gathered the facts to reveal that Ms. Waters has missed an astonishing 90% of Congressional meetings during her 35-year career. This raises serious questions about her commitment to serving the people who elected her, and her ability to deliver on the promises she made.

While she may have been known as a champion for social justice in some circles, Ms. Waters has been accused by others of ""peddling race baiting, socialist agendas, and a hatred for the President,"" all while achieving little success in her career. Her behavior towards constituents has also been called into question, as she was filmed being rude to one of her own voters.

Perhaps most concerning is her belief that as a woman of color, she is immune from impeachment. Her focus on skin color over substance has left her with little to offer her constituents and, as a result, she has resorted to using her minority status as a basis for her campaigns.

Despite her wealth and status, Ms. Waters has failed to represent her district well, and many of her constituents have made this clear by gathering outside her million-dollar estate to show her their frustration.

Pelosi has been quick to criticize Roy Moore’s alleged consensual affair with a young woman, but her actions appear to be an attempt to divert attention from her own conduct. It is time for Pelosi to consider retirement, and it is hoped that her departure will enable a Republican to claim her vacated post."
politifact14896,1,1,"We all know that the recently passed tax bill is likely the single worst piece of legislation in the history of American politics. You know it, I know it, Paul Ryan knows it, Donald Trump knows it. Well, Trump probably doesn’t, because, well, he’s delusional.But it’s really, really bad. And historically unpopular, like the President whose name will forever be attached to it.Maybe you aren’t totally convinced about how bad it is yet. So there’s this: Under this plan, a wealthy CEO can deduct a private jet, but a police officer cannot deduct his/her uniform.“Yeah, but they’re the party of ‘Blue Lives Matter’ and thanking everyone who ever wore a uniform for anything for their service!” you might say. And I have some oceanfront property in Idaho to sell you if you believe that.Salon reports, Donald Trump often declares his support, even love, for police, firefighters and other first responders. That isn’t stopping him, however, from nicking their wallets in the new tax law that he is expected to sign in early January.Buried in the hastily drafted tax bill’s more than 500 pages are provisions eliminating “miscellaneous” deductions taken by almost 28 million taxpayers in 2015. Those are costs you bore to support your job or an investment you own or to pay a professional to prepare your income tax return.This year cops and other first responders can write off the costs of buying uniforms and dry cleaning them. But in 2018, cops who buy their uniforms or are required to buy their own guns and ammunition will no longer be able to deduct those costs as reasonable and necessary expenses to support their earning a paycheck, thanks to Trump and Congressional Republicans.But that’s not all. Cops and anyone else who belongs to a union will no longer be allowed to deduct their union dues. People who must bear travel costs without reimbursement from their employers will just have to suck it up starting in January.Add police officers, the military, teachers, nurses and first responders to the long, long list of hard working Americans that Donald Trump and the Republican party want to make suffer. And all to give the wealthiest among us more wealth.Shameful.","The recently passed tax bill has been widely regarded as one of the most ill-conceived pieces of legislation in the history of American politics. This opinion has been shared by experts and politicians alike, including Paul Ryan. It is no secret that the bill has been deeply unpopular and will be forever linked to the current sitting President, with the exception of a minority who might argue otherwise. However, the consequences of this legislation extend far beyond mere politics.

One of the worst aspects of this bill is how it treats the hard-working first responders of our country. While President Trump often publicly praises their bravery and dedication, his actions tell a different story. The hastily drafted legislation includes provisions that eliminate ""miscellaneous"" deductions for millions of taxpayers, which has a serious impact on those who own investments or pay for professional tax services.

Even more alarming is the fact that certain deductions like those for uniform purchases, union dues, and travel expenses will no longer be deductible under the new tax laws. This means that police officers and first responders who once could write off the cost of purchasing uniforms and guns will no longer be able to do so. This is an unfair burden placed on some of the most hardworking people in our society.

It is lamentable that the President and those who support this bill have not thought through the consequences of their actions. The tax bill is not simply a political issue; it is a real and consequential issue that impacts the livelihoods and lives of all Americans. We must remain vigilant and call for changes to these provisions before they take effect."
politifact14021,1,0,"COSTA MESA, Ca. – GOP presidential front-runner and billionaire entrepreneur Donald Trump on Thursday unveiled his plan to ‘make the military great again,’ saying he intends to reinstate the draft as part of a larger effort to bolster America’s armed forces. “We’re bringing back the draft, okay? We’re going to bring it back and were going to make America as strong as we were in the Sixties,” Trump declared while addressing supporters at the Pacific Amphitheater in Costa Mesa.“I love the Sixties,” said Trump, continuing, “I was a very big supporter of the Vietnam war and, of course, the troops. No one supports the troops more than I do.” In addition to bringing back military conscription, Mr. Trump said that if elected, he will enact legislation that will guarantee citizenship to anyone who serves in the armed forces for a minimum of four years. “You have people coming into this country, coming over our borders, expecting a free ride. We’re not going to give it to them, folks. They’re going to have to earn their citizenship.”Trump has repeatedly stated that he won’t rule out using nuclear weapons against the Islamic State. On Thursday he expanded on his claims, saying he would instruct the Pentagon to begin testing “man-portable” tactical nuclear weapons to be used by American soldiers on the battlefield. “We’re not going to have unquestionable military dominance if we’re seen as too weak to use these weapons against our enemies.”Rather than use conventional means such as drone strikes or economic sanctions to respond to acts of terrorism or other forms of aggression against the United States, Trump vowed to exercise the nuclear option “extremely” liberally. “My feeling is we have these weapons and we’ve spent a great deal of money developing and improving them over the years; there’s absolutely no reason why we shouldn’t be using them.”The former reality TV star accused President Obama of making the country less safe by employing tact and diplomacy when dealing with foreign leaders. “This guy’s the president of the United States and he’s bowing to the Chinese. They’re laughing in our faces, okay? They’re laughing in our faces and if we don’t do something about it, they’re going to surpass us militarily and economically and then we’re going to have a huge problem on our hands.”Donald Trump kicked off the start of his California campaign on Thursday where he made a stop in Costa Mesa, a semi-rural farming community located in Orange County. The GOP presidential hopeful is scheduled to address California’s Republican convention on Friday.","Donald Trump, a leading candidate for the presidency of the United States, announced his intentions to strengthen the nation's military in a speech given to his supporters in Costa Mesa.

He has gone on record as saying he will use nuclear weapons against ISIS, the terrorist organization operating in the Middle East.

politifact15334,1,0,"‘Smallville’ star Allison Mack has confessed that she sold children to the Rothschilds and Clintons during her time in the child sex cult.According to police, Allison Mack worked in a senior management position for the Hollywood pedophile cult NXIVM. As second-in-command, it was her job to lure children into the cult in order to sell them to elite Hollywood pedophiles and powerful politicians.Thefreethoughtproject.com reports: “As alleged in the indictment, Allison Mack recruited women to join what was purported to be a female mentorship group that was, in fact, created and led by Keith Raniere. The victims were then exploited, both sexually and for their labor, to the defendants’ benefit,” U.S. Attorney Richard P. Donoghue said in a statement.The cult was finally exposed when the daughter of former Dynasty actress Catherine Oxenberg became a member. Oxenberg told the New York Times that she became concerned after she saw that her 26-year-old daughter India was extremely emaciated from dieting, and was suffering from serious health problems.“Some people have said this is a voluntary sorority. The women I have spoken to tell a far different story,” Oxenberg said. “Coercion is not voluntary. Extortion is not voluntary. Blackmail is not voluntary.”When these accusations hit the news, other women, including actress Sarah Edmondson, came forward to all to tell the same story, of the blackmail, the branding, as well as the forced labor and forced sexual activity.Raniere is also accused of having a history of pedophilia, with accusations that stretch back over 20 years, involving girls as young as 12.In 2012, several women were interviewed by the Albany Times Union about the coercive sexual experiences that they had with Raniere when they were young girls. One of the women in the case was found dead of a gunshot wound before she was able to give the interview. Her death was ruled a suicide.The U.S. attorney’s office requested to have Raniere held without bail in a letter to the court stating that he was a known child predator.Although this extremely important detail is being left out of most mainstream reports, one of the main charges in the criminal indictment against Raniere and Mack is sex trafficking of children.A quick search for Allison Mack’s arrest report or charges—as reported by the mainstream media—will not yield any mention of children. Most mainstream reports only mention sex trafficking and ominously omit that the charges were for sex trafficking of children. Exactly why the media is refusing to report this remains a mystery.Another important aspect of this case that has been largely overlooked, is the connections that this organization has to high-level figures in politics and finance. The organization worked much like a pyramid scheme, collecting regular fees from its members. But the majority of the funding, over $150 million, came from the trust funds of Seagram heiresses, Sara and Clare Bronfman.Their involvement with Raniere began in 2002 and has been very public and controversial, with other members of the Bronfman family distancing themselves from the sisters in the press. The Bronfman family has very close ties to the Rothschild banking dynasty, with members of both families belonging to many of the same companies, including their joint financial firm, Bronfman & Rothschild.Additionally, at least three high-ranking members of the organization, including Nancy Salzman and the Bronfman sisters, are members of Bill Clinton’s foundation, the Clinton Global Initiative, which requires an annual $15,000 membership fee.Now that Raniere is in jail and Mack is on bail and ordered not to have any contact with other cult members, Clare Bronfman has taken on the role of leader within the organization.In response to the recent controversy surrounding NXIVM, Bronfman made a statement on her website denying the accusations against Raniere. She praised Raniere and the NXIVM programs, insisting that she is doing work that is tru","Allison Mack, former ‘Smallville’ star, recently confessed to her role in the notorious child sex cult NXIVM, where she held a senior management position. As second-in-command, her primary responsibilities included luring children into the cult before selling them to Hollywood’s elite pedophiles and high-ranking politicians. These allegations came to light once Catherine Oxenberg’s daughter, India, became a member of the cult, and Catherine noticed her daughter's deteriorating health as a result of their practices. Other victims, including actress Sarah Edmondson, came forward, providing insight into the cult's cruel and coercive behavior, which included forced labor, sexual exploitation, and even branding. Keith Raniere, the cult’s leader, has a history of pedophilia dating back two decades. Shockingly, the criminal indictment against Raniere and Mack includes charges of sex trafficking of children which many mainstream reports omit. This cult’s reach extends beyond its manipulative practices, as it amassed over $150 million from its members, with a significant portion stemming from the trusts of the wealthy Bronfman family. The Bronfman sisters, with close ties to the Rothschild banking dynasty, have also been members of Bill Clinton’s foundation. Nancy Salzman and the Bronfman sisters have taken on a leadership role following Raniere’s arrest. While supporters of the cult emphasize the positive aspects of the NXIVM program, the insidious nature of its practices cannot be ignored."
politifact15625,1,1,"San Juan mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz’s party are facing fraud charges relating to the embezzlement of over $3 million in federal funds, just months after she appeared on CNN and blamed President Trump for mishandling the Puerto Rico hurricane disaster response.Despite the fact that the U.S. government sent emergency workers, supplies and billions of dollars to the territory, its Democrat-allied politicians still pointed a finger at the president — and the left-leaning mainstream media happily spread the “blame Trump” narrative.As comparisons to George W. Bush and Hurricane Katrina grew, figures like San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz attacked Trump for supposedly mishandling the disaster response, despite the fact that emergency management experts praised the president and FEMA’s actions.“What is really nasty is that anyone would turn their back on the Puerto Rican people,” Yulín Cruz declared at the time, even wearing a T-shirt labeled “NASTY” — where did she get it during a major storm? — as part of a petty jab at the U.S. president.Liberals across the United States, glued to CNN, cheered the San Juan mayor and declared her a national hero. “We are dying, and you (Trump) are killing us with the inefficiency and the bureaucracy,” she said during a television conference in early October.Western Journal reports: Fast forward to this week. It turns out that sure enough, there was plenty of “inefficiency and bureaucracy” in Puerto Rico … but it looks like the island’s own liberal politicians were likely the ones behind it.According to the Associated Press, a Puerto Rican mayor and two additional island officials have now been charged with corruption.Although the alleged crimes go back before Hurricane Maria made landfall in the Caribbean, the arrests paint a dire picture of widespread corruption and misuse of government funds during the same general time frame as the disaster.“The suspects are the mayor of the southwest town of Sabana Grande and the former directors of finance for the northern town of Toa Baja,” the AP reported.“U.S. Attorney Rosa Emilia Rodriguez told reporters that the former officials from Toa Baja are accused of using nearly $5 million worth of federal funds to pay the town’s public employees and municipal contractors,” the newswire continued.“Not only is that illegal, it’s immoral,” Rodriguez added.Puerto Rico officials are accused of taking millions of dollars that was granted by the United States for assistance programs and re-directing it wherever they saw fit, such as taking $2.5 million from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and using it to pay town employees.At the center of the illegal scheme is Miguel Ortiz Vélez, who served as mayor. Ortiz Vélez belongs to the Popular Democratic Party, which is affiliated with the more well-known Democrat party in the mainland United States.Guess who else belongs to the same liberal PDP political group: Carmen Yulín Cruz, the person who was blaming Trump for hurricane deaths while her own party was defrauding taxpayers and laundering aid money. Is anyone surprised?There may be more arrests to follow, as well. Government officials said that more corruption is suspected, and additional Puerto Rican officials are under scrutiny.“Rodriguez said the investigation into alleged corruption in Toa Baja is ongoing because officials believe other people are involved,” the AP confirmed.The hurricane that devastated Puerto Rico was certainly a tragedy, and many lessons about disaster preparedness can be learned from that incident.However, it’s abundantly clear that widespread corruption and incompetence in Puerto Rico was a major part of the chaos. That corruption doesn’t point to Donald Trump … it leads right to the same leftist Democrats who were trying to point fingers the entire time.","Puerto Rico was devastated by Hurricane Maria, causing a dire situation for its residents. The U.S. government acted quickly, providing emergency workers, supplies, and billions of dollars in aid. However, some Democrat-allied politicians, including San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz, blamed President Trump for mishandling the disaster response. This “blame Trump” narrative was fanned by the left-leaning mainstream media, even though emergency management experts praised the president and FEMA’s actions. 

Recently, corruption charges were brought against Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz’s party for the embezzlement of over $3 million in federal funds. What’s worse, the timing coincides with the timeframe of the disaster response. An additional Puerto Rican mayor and former finance officials were also charged for misuse of government funds. These illegal schemes included taking millions of dollars granted by the United States for assistance programs and re-directing it for their own use. 

At the heart of this corruption scandal is Miguel Ortiz Vélez, ex-Mayor belonging to the Popular Democratic Party, which is affiliated with the Democrat party in mainland United States. San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz also belongs to this political group. There may be more arrests to follow, as government officials suspect that other people are involved. 

The hurricane that devastated Puerto Rico was undoubtedly a tragedy, revealing important lessons about disaster preparedness. However, it is now clear that widespread corruption and incompetence in Puerto Rico was a significant part of the chaos. Validating the president and FEMA's actions, the blame does not lead to Donald Trump. Instead, it leads straight to the same leftist Democrats who were pointing fingers the entire time."

The results of which pushed Russia into a financial depression which ultimately benefitted the billionaire in his deep, greedy pockets.Ever since then Russia has held a grudge against Soros.

His actions have reportedly led to destabilization in those countries' economies and financial markets, pursued with the sole purpose of personal gain at the expense of others.

Soros’ involvement in various anti-Trump protests across the United States has also led to concerns. Media reports allege that he has provided salaries and housing for leaders of the Black Lives Matter group and paid young people to protest against Donald Trump in multiple big cities across the country. He has perpetrated similar actions in different countries throughout Europe and Asia; he causes massive financial chaos in a country, cashes in on it, and moves to the next one.

Notably, Russia holds a deep-seated resentment towards Soros given his controversial role in the country in the 1990s. At the time, Soros wrote a letter denouncing the Russian currency, claiming that it was overvalued. This caused investors to panic and dump the Russian currency, ultimately resulting in a financial depression in Russia that benefited Soros. The incident has sparked a long-standing feud between Soros and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Putin has since issued an international arrest warrant for Soros for his role in collapsing Russia’s currency and its ensuing financial meltdown.

As an American citizen, Soros is protected from being removed from the country. However, it remains to be seen how President Trump will approach Soros' actions when he assumes office."
politifact15146,1,1,"The Democrats mulling a run for the White House in 2020 are facing intense pressure from liberals to campaign on abolishing the agency that enforces federal immigration laws, a proposal that was once relegated to the far-left fringe.In protesting the Trump administration’s policies toward illegal immigration, liberal commentators and writers have been embracing the idea of gutting the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, which identifies, arrests and deports illegal immigrants inside the United States.“This is a growing position on the left, and I imagine 2020 Democratic presidential aspirants will have to grapple with it,” liberal writer and MSNBC host Chris Hayes tweeted.In January, the idea was endorsed by Brian Fallon, a former top aide to 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and Eric Holder, President Barack Obama’s attorney general. The Daily Caller first drew attention to the calls.“ICE operates as an unaccountable deportation force,” Fallon tweeted. “Dems running in 2020 should campaign on ending the agency in its current form.”Thomas Homan, the acting director of ICE, has reacted to these calls by Democrats by saying they should speak to victims of illegal immigrant crime.“These politicians, they need to talk to the victims of alien crime, talk to the parents that I talk to that lost children at the hands of criminal aliens,” Homan said Thursday on Fox News’ “Tucker Carlson Tonight.”But the idea has picked up steam in recent days after Hayes, the MSNBC host, asked Democratic California Sen. Kamala Harris if she believes ICE should exist.“ICE has a purpose, ICE has a role, ICE should exist,” Harris, a potential 2020 candidate, responded. “But let’s not abuse the power.”Since then, Harris, the former attorney general of California, has faced a backlash from liberal publications.“Kamala Harris is very likely running for president in 2020,” Jack Mirkinson of the liberal Splinter website wrote. “It should be a political problem for her that she is not willing to take her criticisms of ICE to their logical conclusion and call for its abolition.”He added: “She should be asked, over and over again, why exactly she is willing to uphold the legitimacy of such a racist, corrupt, and thuggish organization.”Mirkinson wrote that other potential candidates -- like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti -- “should be asked the same question.”PELOSI SLAMS CALIFORNIA ICE RAID AS ‘UNJUST AND CRUEL’The Nation, a liberal magazine, last week also published an article titled “It’s Time to Abolish ICE.” The writer accused the agency of being part of an “unbridled white-supremacist surveillance state” and called it “an unaccountable strike force executing a campaign of ethnic cleansing.”“Though the party has moved left on core issues -- from reproductive rights to single-payer health care -- it’s time for progressives to put forward a demand that deportation be taken not as the norm, but rather as a disturbing indicator of authoritarianism,” McElwee wrote.Democratic officeholders also have been openly rebelling against ICE, including Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, who recently tipped off the public to an immigration raid in the San Francisco Bay Area.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., last week slammed that raid as ""unjust and cruel.""Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in a speech in California last week, said as many as 800 illegal immigrants may have evaded capture and said Schaff’s tip-off put both residents and law enforcement at risk.SESSIONS UNLOADS ON CALIFORNIA DEMS FOR ‘RADICAL, OPEN BORDERS AGENDA’Sessions called California’s ""open borders"" policies a “radical, irrational idea that cannot be accepted.”“It cannot be the policy of a great nation to reward those who unlawfully enter its country with legal status, Social Security, welfare, food stamps, and work permits and so forth,” he said. “How can this be a sound polic","The issue of abolishing the agency responsible for enforcing federal immigration laws has become a focal point for many Democrats considering a run for the presidency in 2020. The idea, once a hallmark of far-left ideology, has gained mainstream traction in recent months amongst those on the left who are protesting the Trump administration's policies toward illegal immigration. Advocates for this proposal, including liberal writers and commentators, believe that the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is operating as an ""unaccountable deportation force"" and must be reformed. This sentiment has even been echoed by high-profile Democrats such as former Hillary Clinton aide Brian Fallon and former Attorney General under President Obama, Eric Holder. However, the acting director of ICE, Thomas Homan, has dismissed these calls, stating that politicians critical of the agency should speak with victims of illegal immigrant crime. Recently, Democratic Senator Kamala Harris faced criticism from liberal publications for not taking her criticisms of ICE far enough. Other potential Democratic candidates such as Bernie Sanders, Kirsten Gillibrand, Elizabeth Warren, and Eric Garcetti, have also been called upon to weigh in on the issue. The liberal magazine, The Nation, has published an article titled, ""It's Time to Abolish ICE,"" and accuses the agency of being a part of an ""unbridled white-supremacist surveillance state."" Meanwhile, California's ""open borders"" policies have been a flashpoint for lawmakers, with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi recently criticizing the tactics of ICE and Attorney General Jeff Sessions calling such policies ""radical"" and ""irrational."" Ultimately, the debate around immigration will be a major factor in the upcoming 2020 presidential race, as candidates look to address the concerns of a country struggling to find unified solutions to a complex issue."

This is about the judicial branch interpreting the laws as they apply to the teaching of religion.We should be teaching any religions in this country besides standard Judeo-Christianity, as our founders wanted, and we certainly shouldn’t be filling the children with lies about Islam being a ‘religion of peace’ when they see the carnage on the news almost every day.”Gorsuch continued, “It is our duty as Americans first and judges second to safeguard the way our children are indoctrinated.”The Obama Administration forced the children to learn about Islam as the “Religion of Peace,” only so that they could be more tolerant of the terrorists.

The court, in a 5-3 decision, ruled that public schools in America will not teach the tenets of Islam or Sharia Law. According to reliable sources, this ruling does not preclude the study of Islam in history, as is done with Christianity and other religions, but only within the context of the historical period being studied.

Judge Neil Gorsuch, writing for the court, emphasized that while the government must not be involved in religion, the decision to teach about religion must be viewed as within the purview of the judicial branch. It is the duty of the court, he explained, to safeguard the education of children in America and prevent their indoctrination with false beliefs.

Gorsuch further argued that teaching Islam solely as a religion of peace was a misguided effort by the previous administration to create tolerance for terrorists which should not be repeated. The true values and worship of the one and only true God can now be respected, thanks to the court’s decision and the support of President Donald Trump.

politifact15599,1,0,"The New York Times had no idea in 1984 that a piece taking a deep dive into the life of an upcoming billionaire would eventually resurface as confirmation of just how PERFECT a fit President Trump is for this time in America. We pulled out the highlights for you below but the entire article is incredible. Who could have predicted in 1984? Well, it seems that The New York Times described brilliant businessman Donald J. Trump as a great future President of the United States…THE EXPANDING EMPIRE OF DONALD TRUMP:‘DONALD! HEY, DONALD! DONALD!’ The men were yelling, eager to call him by name. A storm front of cigar smoke was gathering above the hotel ballroom, packed elbow-to-elbow for a breakfast-hour sports forum with a crowd that included some of New York’s most wealthy, powerful and famous men.He has no public-relations agent. His competitors wonder how this can be, but watching him at the sports forum provided an explanation.While executives of the other teams told the audience about problems of negotiation and arbitration, about dirty restrooms inside their arenas and street crime outside and about ‘attempting to move the Mets in the right direction,’“He said further that he would ‘continue to create chaos’ for the N.F.L. and, by the way, that he planned to build a domed stadium in New York.”Donald Trump was electrifying the room the rat-a-tat-tat revelations, dropping names of star N.F.L. players and coaches he would sign in a matter of hours.IT IS NOT YET 9 AM SPENDING A DAY WITH Donald Trump is like driving a Ferrari without the windshield. It’s exhilarating; he gets a few bugs in his teeth.Although he is still interested in such ideas as putting up the world’s tallest building on the East River, his mind wanders from the business of New York real estate.He has told people in the communications industry that he is ‘very interested in communications,’ which is like a 2,000-pound gorilla mentioning that he is very interested in becoming carnivorous.The Trump touch. It has set some people in New York to outright Trump worship; they call him ‘a real-estate genius’ who has helped lead the city out of the darkness of the mid-1970’s into a new era of glamour and excitement. Mr. Trump does not take exception to that.Many urban-affairs experts view the developers as saviors of our postindustrial cities. ‘With manufacturing leaving,’ says George Sternlieb, director of the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers University, ‘and with Federal and state aid diminishing, our cities desperately need the rich. Cities are tending to fall into two categories: cities of consumption and cities with no economic base.’The rich of the world can live anywhere they want, explain the experts; Mr. Trump leads them to New York. Sales taxes, user taxes, jobs and resulting payroll taxes are generated.That Mr. Trump was able to obtain the location, when every real-estate developer in the world would have done just about anything to get it, is testimony to Donald Trump’s persistence and to his skills as a negotiator. That he was able to put up a building of this dimension on this site demonstrates his finesse with the zoning code.‘He has the uncanny ability to smell blood in the water,’ a competitor says. He obtained the air rights over Tiffany, which allowed him to build a much higher building, and went to Equitable, which sold him the land for a 50 percent interest in the project.The day before he has sent $3,000 to an unfortunate family he has red about in the newspaper, something he does frequently, according to Mrs. Foerderer.For a billion-dollar corporation, there aren’t too many people around.Donald Trump makes or approves practically all decisions. He does not seem to write anything down, keeping volumes of company files as mental notes.Says Louise M. Sunshine, executive vice president: ‘If it is not the impossible, Donald is simply not interested. There has to be creativity. Money ceased to be the object a long time ago.’ Mr. Trump agrees with this assessment.‘He is an almost unbelievable negotiator,’ says Irving Fischer of HRH Construction. ‘I don’t worship at the shrine of Donald Trump,’ he says, ‘but our company has given up trying to negotiate costs with him. We just say: ‘Tell us what you want, you’re going to get it anyway.’‘Trump can sense when people might want to get out of a project,’ says a developer… He trusts his instincts and has the guts to act on them.’Roy M. Cohn, Mr. Trump’s friend and attorney, adds: ‘He has an uncanny sense of knowing that something is a good deal when it looks dismal to everyone else.’Such was his first deal in Manhattan, his purchase of the Commodore Hotel on East 42nd Street in the mid-1970’s, when even the Chrysler Building across the street was in foreclosure. Fred Trump described his son’s efforts to buy the hotel as ‘fighting for a seat on the Titanic.’ But, Donald Trump says, ‘I saw all those people coming out of Grand Central Terminal, and I said to myself, ‘How bad can this be?” He completely renovated the hotel, reopening it as the chrome-and-glass Grand Hyatt Hotel.He had moved in quietly, sending 14 different people to purchase 15 parcels of land and keeping his name out of it. ‘If the seller was Italian,’ says Mr. Trump, ‘we sent an Italian’ – something he probably did not learn at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Finance, where he received a B.A. in economics in 1968. He bought and sold a few pieces of real estate in Philadelphia when he was bored with classes.‘It’s in his genes,’ says Fred Trump, explaining his son’s success in real estate and recalling his three sons growing up on construction sites and in rental offices.‘Donald Trump is the Michael Jackson of real estate,’ says Mr. Fischer. ‘We’ve been dealing with him since he was 16. He was an old trouper at age 25.’His success also derives from his marketing skills. ‘I want to bring a","In 1984, The New York Times published an article detailing the rise of businessman Donald J. Trump, and it is interesting to see how it now serves as a testament to his suitability as President of the United States. At a sports forum breakfast with New York City's elite, Mr. Trump appeared larger than life, with no public-relations agent to answer for his bold statements. His ability to electrify the room with ease, revealing rat-a-tat-tat revelations and dropping names of star N.F.L players and coaches he would sign within hours, left the audience in awe. Despite his ongoing interest in ambitious projects such as building the world's tallest building on the East River and constructing a domed stadium in New York, Mr. Trump's reputation as a master negotiator and a creative visionary precedes him. His development of real estate in New York City, specifically around Times Square, has been praised by industry experts as instrumental to the city's transformation from a postindustrial wasteland into a thriving metropolis. His uncanny ability to find opportunities where others see peril is matched only by his business acumen and marketing skills, traits which have defined his success over the course of his career."

(Proverbs 15:18)","The allegations made against Alabama senatorial candidate Roy Moore by one of the accusers, Deborah Wesson Gibson, demand serious consideration. It has come to light that Gibson is a passionate progressive, having worked for the Democratic National Committee and actively campaigning for Moore's opponent, Doug Jones. This revelation raises questions about the motivations behind Gibson's accusations and her credibility in this matter.

Gibson, a sign language interpreter, has been involved with Democratic rallies and has been a vocal supporter of Jones. Her opposition to Moore is abundantly clear. However, it is worth noting that these allegations come nearly four decades after the alleged events and may be difficult to defend against. The timing of these allegations proves suspicious as well, and the political affiliations of Gibson raise the question of whether a political agenda is at play.

Moreover, the accusations have prompted a response from Moore's wife, Kayla Moore, who has reported harassment from The Washington Post and their digging into the couple's personal lives. Corroborating this claim, witnesses have emerged, alleging that The Washington Post engaged in bribery to obtain dirt on Moore. This gives further cause to examine the motives and ethics of the media organization and those associating with them.

Finally, these allegations come at a crucial juncture in America's history, and the political and spiritual future of the country is indeed at stake. It is imperative that we examine all claims with the utmost scrutiny and discernment, and earnestly pray for our leaders and nation."

Recently, a story gained traction about one of Beverly Nelson's claims in regards to Judge Roy Moore, a leading Senate candidate from Alabama. Nelson, accused Moore of sexual misconduct, went through Gloria Allred, a well-known attorney, in order to establish her case. However, more and more allegations against Nelson and Allred are emerging, calling into question the truthfulness of the original statements. In fact, Nelson has recently admitted, on Good Morning America, to tampering with and modifying notes on what she claimed was Moore's yearbook signature.

However, Nelson's admission is factual and was reported by ABC's GMA. This incident has raised concerns over the social media giant's possible political bias.

Facebook's decision to suppress this story appears to show a lack of impartiality and a bias towards a political agenda. This begs the question, what else is Facebook suppressing? It is vital that the media remains impartial and does not take sides. It is up to readers to decide for themselves which side of the story they believe, and it is the media's responsibility to provide all relevant information in a fair and unbiased manner.

Johnson was exposed to temperatures ranging between 1400 to 1800 degrees Fahrenheit and died from his injuries. In an interview with police, Jenna Davis, one of Johnson's coworkers, recalled hearing him scream as the crematory was activated. Davis claims that the young colleague responsible for the accident was a new and inexperienced employee who failed to check for a toe tag. Police have now launched a thorough investigation into this unfortunate episode. Authorities have not ruled out the possibility of pressing criminal charges against the employee involved. The incident highlights the importance of maintaining a strict adherence to safety protocols in all workplaces, particularly those involving hazardous materials and equipment."

This comes as the federal agency Housing and Urban Development is rolling out its nationwide ban on smoking in public housing, and just a few years after many states have outlawed smoking in beaches and public parks.

And would that be such a bad thing? Facebook  Twitter  Pinterest  Google+ “In America, it’s very difficult to be simply paternalistic,” Ronald Bayer, co-director of the Center for the History and Ethics of Public Health at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health, tells Yahoo Lifestyle. American values of privacy and freedom make it very difficult to prohibit anything as mainstream as tobacco, even if it’s to save the lives of smokers. That old “nanny state” argument rears its head every time. With millions of people still addicted to cigarettes, there is also the very real fear that a ban would spawn a black market similar to what exists with illegal drugs or what happened with alcohol during Prohibition. Facebook  Twitter  Pinterest  Google+ 5. What's Next? Bayer suggests that one way to help people quit would be by tackling the problem from the supply side. “I think we would do much better to think about reducing the nicotine content, so that the addictive quality of cigarettes wasn’t as severe, and make quitting easier.” The World Health Organization’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control established a method called MPOWER in 2008 that aims to end the “global tobacco epidemic,” which kills over 7 million people each year. The way to do this is not by banning it all at once, but instead by monitoring use and prevention, protecting citizens from second-hand smoke, offering ways to help people quit, warning people of the dangers of smoking, enforcing bans on advertising, and raising taxes on tobacco products.If you like this blog don't forget to share it.You are currently reading about Smoking In Cars With Children Is Illegal Starting January 30, 2018.

The Department of Health warns that children who breathe in secondhand smoke, inhale thousands of chemicals, putting them at risk for fatal illnesses such as cancer, bronchitis, and pneumonia. Asthma condition can also worsen due to exposure to cigarette smoke.

This law, however, raises questions about whether the trend will continue, and if lawmakers will ever pass down a ban that prohibits all tobacco smoking altogether.

Many people are still addicted to smoking, and they express fear that bans would spawn a black market similar to the one with illegal drugs.

A potential solution would be to restrict the addictive quality of cigarettes by lessening their nicotine content, making quitting easier.

politifact14238,1,0,"Police in Vernal Heights, Florida, arrested 3-practicing cannibals who claim eating human flesh cures both type-1 and type-2 diabetes and depression.According to Vernal Heights Chief of Police, Gregory Moore, the 3-men were arrested when officers responded to what they assumed would be a routine noise complaint.Police arrived at 3845 Toolson Lane (the home of William Provost) at approximately 7:45 PM on Sunday evening in response to a neighbor complaining of strange sounds coming from the home.Responding officers told reporters that they assumed their visit to the house would be a quick one and that they would simply be asking the residents to keep the noise down.When the officers arrived at 3845 Toolson Lane, they repeatedly knocked on the door and rang the doorbell, however, nothing could be heard over the sound a stereo inside the house repeatedly playing the same song, which was later identified as – Enya’s ‘Who Can Say’.After attempting to get the attention of the homeowner via knocking and ringing the doorbell for approximately 5-minutes, police entered the home through an unlocked door located at the rear of the house.The responding officers told reporters that the house had been extremely dark, cluttered, and an overwhelming smell (which was later identified as decomposing flesh) filled the home. Upon clearing the first-floor of the home, the responding officers realized that the blaring music was coming from the home’s basement.According to the officers, a bizarre crime scene was quickly uncovered upon entering the basement. Three men, which have since been identified as 62-year-old William Provost, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore were sitting in a circle on the basement’s concrete floor and ritualistically chanting while eating what police initially believed was an animal carcass, but was later identified as human remains.William Provost, who police believe to be the group’s ringleader, admitted to practicing cannibalism and told arresting officers:“I find human flesh to be the only thing that cures my type-2 diabetes and chronic depression. If expensive pharmaceutical drugs helped, I would figure out a way to obtain them, but they don’t, so I stick to what works for me”.Upon searching the home’s basement, police made several startling discoveries including a large room that appears to contain nothing more than decades worth of clutter, but upon further inspection, police discovered human remains hidden throughout the old wooden furniture and broken appliances.Police also discovered a kitchen style refrigerator located in a small room in the corner of the basement that contained the limbs, organs, and miscellaneous remains of what police believe to be upwards of 7-8 different individuals.In addition to the refrigerator, the small room in the basement also housed a make-shift ‘tool wall’ that contained a myriad of tools that police believe were used to dismember several victims.Upon their initial investigation, police believe the 3-men have been practicing cannibalism for the past 3-4 years and largely remained under the radar due to their practice of targeting and befriending homeless drifters they met at small dive-bars located upwards of 100-miles from their Vernal Heights residence.Vernal Heights Chief of Police, Gregory Moore, spoke to reporters during a brief press-conference this morning.“Though modern-day cannibalism is extremely rare, it does unfortunately exist. That said -treating diabetes and or depression has to be the most bizarre reason for practicing cannibalism that I’ve ever heard.”Provost’s accomplices, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore, also admitted to cannibalizing human flesh because they believed it would cure depression and told arresting officer’s that Provost took them under his wing in late-2012.As of Tuesday afternoon, police and detectives are still conducting a search at the residence located at 3845 Toolson Lane.All three men are current","Police in Vernal Heights, Florida, have apprehended three self-proclaimed cannibals who asserted that consuming human flesh can cure type-1 and type-2 diabetes as well as depression. The men were taken into custody after Vernal Heights Chief of Police, Gregory Moore, received a noise complaint from a neighbor who lived near William Provost's 3845 Toolson Lane residence. The officers dispatched to the scene assumed a routine operation and expected to deal with a simple case of loud music. However, upon arriving, they received no response to their attempt to contact the homeowners, neither to their doorbell ringing nor to their knocking. The only sound that occurred was an unmuted stir of Enya's ‘Who Can Say' in the background. 

As the officers proceeded to enter the house, they discovered two interesting things: a pungent odor that they later identified as the smell of decomposing flesh, which pervaded the residence. And secondly, William Provost, Michael Dore, and Dennis Ratcliff were found gathered around a circle consuming what the police suspected to be an animal carcass. Closer inspection revealed it was human remains.

Further investigations exposed a shocking display of cannibalism that had been ongoing for about three to four years. The police believe the trio primarily targeted and befriended homeless drifters they met at small dive-bars located over 100-miles from their residence. Additionally, police discovered human remains hidden throughout Provost's residence, including a kitchen-style refrigerator and a small room that served as a makeshift tool wall, equipped with various tools believed to have been used for dismemberment. 

According to the police, Provost, a 62-year-old man who is believed to be the group's ringleader, admitted to practicing cannibalism, claiming that human flesh worked better than expensive pharmaceutical drugs for his type-2 diabetes and chronic depression. Meanwhile, Dennis Ratcliff, 51, and Michael Dore, 36, admitting to indulging in the practice because they also believed that it would cure depression.

Speaking at a press conference, Vernal Heights Chief of Police, Gregory Moore, expressed his shock at the bizarre reason for cannibalism that he has ever heard, adding that although it is a rare phenomenon, modern-day cannibalism does exist. As of Tuesday afternoon, police and detectives were still searching the Toolson Lane residence, and all three men were languishing in prison, awaiting justice."

We want to make an important clarification on claims that were made by Rod Wheeler, the private investigator hired by Seth Rich's family, whose services are being paid for by a third party.What he told FOX 5 DC on camera Monday regarding Seth Rich's murder investigation is in clear contrast to what he has said over the last 48 hours. Rod Wheeler has since backtracked.In an interview Monday, Wheeler told FOX 5 DC he had sources at the FBI confirming there was evidence of communication between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks. This is the verbatim of that exchange:FOX 5 DC: “You have sources at the FBI saying that there is information...”WHEELER: ""For sure...""FOX 5 DC: “...that could link Seth Rich to WikiLeaks?""WHEELER: ""Absolutely. Yeah. That's confirmed.""In the past 48 hours, Rod Wheeler has told other media outlets he did not get his information from FBI sources, contradicting what he told us on Monday.Since Rod Wheeler backtracked Tuesday, FOX 5 DC attempted incessantly to communicate with him, but he didn't return calls or emails.On Wednesday, just before our newscast, Wheeler responded to our requests via a telephone conversation, where he now backtracks his position and Wheeler characterizes his on-the-record and on-camera statements as ""miscommunication.""When asked if Wheeler is still working for Seth Rich's family, Wheeler told FOX 5 DC the contract still stands-- ties have not been severed.We reached out once again to the Rich family, and through a spokesperson the Rich family tells FOX 5 DC, ""The family has relayed their deep disappointment with Rod Wheeler's conduct over the last 48 hours, and is exploring legal avenues to the family.""-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Original story:It has been almost a year since Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich was murdered in the nation's capital. There have been no solid answers about why he was killed until now.Rich was shot and killed last July in Northwest D.C and police have suggested the killing in the District's Bloomingdale neighborhood was a botched robbery. However, online conspiracy theories have tied the murder to Rich's work at the DNC.Just two months shy of the one-year anniversary of Rich's death, FOX 5 has learned there is new information that could prove these theorists right.Rod Wheeler, a private investigator hired by the Rich family, suggests there is tangible evidence on Rich's laptop that confirms he was communicating with WikiLeaks prior to his death. Wheeler's services were offered to the family and paid for by a third party, according to a statement issued by the Rich family Tuesday which also includes that ""the private investigator who spoke to press was offered to the Rich family and paid for by a third party, and contractually was barred from speaking to press or anyone outside of law enforcement or the family unless explicitly authorized by the family.""Now, questions have been raised on why D.C. police, the lead agency on this murder investigation for the past ten months, have insisted this was a robbery gone bad when there appears to be no evidence to suggest that.Wheeler, a former D.C. police homicide detective, is running a parallel investigation into Rich’s murder. He said he believes there is a cover-up and the police department has been told to back down from the investigation.""The police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming,” said Wheeler. “They haven't been cooperating at all. I believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer, which I believe is either at the police department or either at the FBI. I have been told both.”When we asked Wheeler if his sources have told him there is information that links Rich to Wikileaks, he said, “Absolutely. Yeah. That's confirmed.""Wheeler also told us, ""I have a source inside the police department that has looked at me straight in the eye and said, ‘Rod, we were told to stand down on this case and I can’t share any information with you.’ Now, that is highly unusual for a murder investigation, especially from a police department. Again, I don’t think it comes from the chief’s office, but I do believe there is a correlation between the mayor's office and the DNC and that is the information that will come out [Tuesday].Wheeler told FOX 5 that he will provide us with a full report with the new details.FOX 5's Melanie Alnwick spoke with D.C. Police on Tuesday and was told that Wheeler’s assertion that a source inside the department told him that detectives were instructed to stand down regarding the Rich case was false.The family sent Alnwick a statement on Tuesday with the following statement:""As we've seen through the past year of unsubstantiated claims, we see no facts, we have seen no evidence, we have been approached with no emails and only learned about this when contacted by the press. Even if tomorrow, an email was found, it is not a high enough bar of evidence to prove any interactions as emails can be altered and we've seen that those interested in pushing conspiracies will stop at nothing to do so. We are a family who is committed to facts, not fake evidence that surfaces every few months to fill the void and distract law enforcement and the general public from finding Seth's murderers. The services of the private investigator who spoke to press was offered to the Rich family and paid for by a third party, and contractually was barred from speaking to press or anyone outside of law enforcement or the family unless explicitly authorized by the family.""PREVIOUS COVERAGE ON THE SETH RICH MURDER INVESTIGATION:Family of DNC staffer Seth Rich seeking to raise money to help solve his murderRepublican lobbyist says murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich linked to Russian operativesMother of murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich pleads for public's helpRepublican lobbyist offers $100K reward in murder of Democratic National Committee staffer Seth RichWikiLeaks offers $20K reward in murder of DNC staffer Seth","An update has been made to the investigation regarding Seth Rich, which was first reported by FOX 5 DC.

These claims contradicted previous statements made by Wheeler, leaving many with questions about the validity of his sources.

politifact14148,1,0,"We all get lazy from time to time and just want to quit everything, crawl back to bed under a layer of blankets and live there until we feel better. We might feel a bit guilty but a relaxing day in bed sounds awesome. Even though it’s a luxury which few of us can afford, at least we can all fantasize about it.If you’re one of those who are in desperate need of some peace and relaxation, NASA might offer you the perfect opportunity to do so and get payed on top of it. But it may involve a bit more relaxation than you’re prepared for.NASA has put out an ad looking for people who’re willing to take part in their “Rest Studies” – a study which will require participant to spend 70 straight days in bed, relaxing and smoking different types of cannabis, for which they will receive a salary of 18.000 USD. During the relaxation period participants are allowed to read books, play games, Skype and smoke weed. They can do whatever they want as long as it involves staying in bed, week after week, earning a cool 1200 USD per week.So what is the exact purpose of these studies?These studies have the purpose of figuring out the best way to preserve astronauts’ health and safety during periods of prolonged space travel. Complete rest and relaxation is the best way to stimulate zero gravity in space because zero gravity actually means zero weight or strain on your muscle. Additionally, they wanted to see how marijuana will affect the body in such an environment.The Rest Study is a very convenient way to examine the changes our body endures during space travel.This study is designed to achieve three core tasks:Examining how the astronauts’ changing physiology in space could affect the process of certain missions.Examining if the astronauts’ physiological state could affect their ability to perform in particular tasks.Preparing countermeasures to combat any impairment that these physiological conditions may impose.The study’s participants were divided into two groups: exercising and non-exercising.The exercising group will have to exercise (on a specially designed equipment to maintain the laying down position and smoke cannabis), while the non-exercising group will just have to lie down and relax completely.The entire study will last somewhere between 97 and 105, depending on whether you’re in the exercising or non-exercising group.Once the study begins, during the initial 13 days (non-exercising subjects) and 21 days (exercising subjects) you can move around the bed rest area freely, in and out of bed. But once this period ends, for the next 70 days you’ll be forbidden from leaving your bed. For 70 days you’ll have to lie down, with your feet up, kick back and enjoy! You’ll get out of bed only for a few tests and nothing more. 70 days of complete lazing.During the study, NASA will have to conduct bone, muscle and heart tests, as well as tests of your circulatory and nervous systems, your nutritional condition, and your body’s immunity system.But is it worth it?You may not think so at first, but spending two whole months in bed can be really excruciating. At some point you may feel like you can’t take it anymore but at least you can rest assured that your efforts will help in the advancement of human space travel.This will probably be your only opportunity to say that you’ve actually helped send the first astronauts to Mars by just being your lazy self and doing nothing in particular but lying flat on your back.Source:http://mysteriousearth.net","NASA is seeking participants for their ""Rest Studies"", and it may just be the perfect opportunity for those seeking peace and relaxation. However, the study requires individuals to remain in bed for 70 straight days, smoking various types of cannabis and earning a salary of $18,000. While participants are free to engage in activities such as reading, gaming, and video chatting as long as they remain in bed, the study aims to examine the best way to maintain the health and safety of astronauts during prolonged periods of space travel.

Specifically, the study has three core tasks: examining changes in astronauts' physiology during space travel and how it affects mission execution, evaluating whether the physiological state of the astronauts is related to their ability to complete certain tasks, and establishing countermeasures to combat physiological impairments. Participants are divided into two groups - exercising and non-exercising, with the exercising group completing physical tasks on equipment designed to maintain the laying-down position while smoking cannabis. The non-exercising group will relax completely.

During the study, NASA will conduct tests on bones, muscles, hearts, circulatory and nervous systems, nutrition status, and immunity. While the study may sound easy, it comes with a cost, as participants will be forbidden from leaving their beds for 70 days straight.

Ultimately, the study sets out to investigate the effects of complete rest and relaxation in a zero-gravity environment while examining the impact of cannabis consumption on the human body. Although $18,000 is a generous salary, the study may be a challenging proposition for most, but for anyone up for the challenge, it is an opportunity to contribute to the advancement of human space travel."
politifact15156,1,0,"The West Texas Federal Appeals Court, operating out of the 33rd District, has ordered that Barack Obama repay $400 Million to the American people for funds he says were “lost” during an illegal transaction with Iranian hard-liners. Judge Gary Jones and Judge Amanda Perry stood together to overrule Judge Kris Weinshenker in a split decision.Weinshenker, a liberal snowflake appointed by Clinton, was put in his place when the two Bush appointees smacked down a ruling on Obama worthy of the title “Muslim Terrorist Usurper who Held Our Country Hostage.” Jones and Perry pulled no punches in their decisions.Jones wrote:“Never have we had a man do so much damage to our country in two short terms. To grow an economy after saving it from the brink of destruction might be something to be proud of on the outside, but two percent growth might as well be a negative.”Judge Perry added:“Never before has a President taken a knee during his term and flaked on his duties like Obama did. This money is owed to the American perople and then some. Punitive damages weren’t assessed. Had they been it is doubtful Mr. Obama would ever recover financially.”Source: http://dailyworldupdate.com","The West Texas Federal Appeals Court, located in the 33rd District, has ruled that former President Barack Obama must reimburse $400 million to the American population for funds that were deemed ""lost"" in an unlawful transaction with Iranian hard-liners. The verdict, reached by Judges Gary Jones and Amanda Perry, went against the initial ruling proposed by Judge Kris Weinshenker, who was appointed by Clinton. The two Bush appointed judges rejected Weinshenker's proposal, which was labelled as defamatory and inappropriate.

Judge Jones expressed his belief that Obama had caused significant harm to the nation during his two terms in office. Despite having saved the economy from the brink of collapse, only achieving a 2% growth rate was disappointing. Judge Perry emphasized that Obama had shirked his duties by ""taking a knee"" during his time as President. The court unequivocally ruled that Obama must repay the American people and that punitive damages should be considered, given the magnitude of his actions. Failure to earn redemption is a scenario that is likely to leave Mr. Obama facing long-term financial implications."
politifact14664,1,0,"UPDATE: Consistent with our subsequent coverage of the California wildfires, this story has been updated to clarify that Jesus Fabian Gonzales is not suspected of the recent Sonoma County fires that killed 40 residents.The U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) issued a detainer request on the Sonoma County Jail for Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, who was arrested Sunday on suspicion of arson in Wine Country fires.Breitbart News reported earlier this week that Sonoma County Sheriffs had arrested Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, 29, at Maxwell Regional Park in Sonoma County after a series of reports of ongoing fires in the region. Mr. Gonzalez was observed around 3:00 p.m. PDT wearing a jacket and walking “out of the creek area and a plume of smoke behind him,” according to the Santa Rosa Press Democrat.Mr. Gonzalez, who is homeless and reportedly known by law enforcement to have been living under a nearby bridge, claimed he was cold and had lit the fire to stay warm. But it was a balmy 78 degrees when he and the plume of smoke were first observed.Mr. Gonzalez was booked into the Sonoma County Jail for suspicion of felony arson. His bail was set at a steep $110,000, according to the Sonoma County Sheriff Public Information Officer.Sargent Spencer Crum told Breitbart that Mr. Gonzalez is also on a U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) detainer request, despite Sonoma County declaring itself as a “sanctuary county” in May 2014. The county only cooperates with “ICE holds” if the prisoner has been convicted of a felony or any misdemeanor offence that falls within the Trust Act within the last five years. Mr. Gonzalez’s immigration status has not yet been announced.The American Civil Liberties Union argues detainers are a violation of “unreasonable searches and seizures” under the U.S. Constitution’s Fourth Amendment.The Sonoma County Sheriff Department’s “1.0 Policy Statement” reads: “No person shall be held solely on the basis of their immigration status.” The policy adds that “the immigration status of a person, and the lack of immigration documentation, should have no bearing on the manner in which Sheriff’s Office personnel execute their duties.”According to ICE documents, Sonoma County declined 491 detainer requests in 2014 and 2015. During the 2017 period from January 28 through February 3, when President Donald Trump issued his immigration Executive Order 13768 to require all federal, state and local government to comply with ICE detainers, Sonoma County still denied detainers.Sonoma County fires have killed dozens. 172 are still missing and 102,000 residents have been dislocated — about one-fifth of the entire population. The latest financial losses include 3,819 unincorporated parcels with 100 structures valued at $2,016,962,239, and 2,907 homes and 86 commercial units lost in the city of Santa Rosa valued at $1.18 billion.","This article has been updated to clarify that there is no suspicion linking Jesus Fabian Gonzales to the recent wildfires in Sonoma County that tragically claimed the lives of 40 residents. It has come to light that the U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) issued a detainer request for Mr. Gonzales, who was arrested on Sunday on charges of arson in connection with the Wine Country fires. Breitbart News had previously reported that Sonoma County Sheriffs had apprehended the 29-year-old Mr. Gonzales at Maxwell Regional Park after receiving a series of reports of ongoing fires in the area. Witnesses observed Mr. Gonzales emerging from a creek area wearing a jacket around 3:00 p.m. and saw a plume of smoke behind him. Although Mr. Gonzales claimed that he had started the fire to keep warm as he was homeless, temperatures were unseasonably warm at 78 degrees Fahrenheit. He was arrested on suspicion of felony arson and had his bail set at $110,000.

In 2014 and 2015, Sonoma County declined 491 detainer requests, and even after President Trump issued Executive Order 13768 this year, requiring all federal, state, and local governments to comply with ICE detainers, the county refused to do so.

politifact14905,1,0,"The guest list hasn’t been set for the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, but a number of things could stand in the way of President Donald Trump getting an invite.But a former U.S. president might make the list, due to his friendship with the young British royal: Barack Obama and his wife, former first lady Michelle, who appear to have amiable relations with Harry and his elder brother and future king, Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge.Asked about the potential guest list, Kensington Palace spokeswoman Julie Barley told Newsweek, “We’re focusing on the happy announcement of their engagement,” adding that invitations “will be announced in due course.”Mark Blinch/ReutersWhen the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were married, in 2011, the Obamas were left off the guest list because of the added security costs of protecting the president. The day of the wedding, thousands of Britons took the day off, and about 1,900 guests attended the ceremony in Westminster Abbey in central London. The Obamas traveled to the U.K. less than a month later for an official state visit. Since Obama is no longer president, he doesn’t require as extensive a security detail as he once did.If Trump were to appear at Prince Harry’s wedding in spring 2018, it would likely spark protests. When Prime Minister Theresa May offered Trump a state visit early this year, polls showed that 2 million people intended to take part in a protest against him. The risk of embarrassment, were such a protest to occur at a royal wedding, might put the couple off inviting such a controversial figure.Instead of a state visit, Trump’s trip to the U.K., scheduled for early 2018, has been cast as a “working trip” where he will not meet the queen. In January, sources said Trump wanted to go “one better” than Obama’s state visit and play golf with Queen Elizabeth II at Balmoral Castle.Keep up with this story and more by subscribing nowRead more: Melania Trump “went bananas” when Ivana Trump called herself 'first lady'The Obamas have forged a close relationship with Prince Harry. Former first lady Michelle Obama appeared with the 33-year-old royal for charity events in Chicago at the end of October. The former president was overheard quizzing Harry on his relationship with Markle, an American actor, when he sat with the prince at the Invictus Games, a sports event for injured servicemen and women founded by the prince, at the end of September in Toronto. Prince Harry also hosted Obama at Kensington Palace in May.As for President Trump, Harry's wife-to-be revealed that she was not a fan. In an interview on The Nightly Show With Larry Wilmore during the 2016 election, Markle said she might decide to stay in Toronto—where her show, Suits, is filmed—if Trump were to win.“We film Suits in Toronto, and I might just stay in Canada. I mean, come on, if that's reality we are talking about, come on, that is a game changer in terms of how we move in the world here,” she said.Markle supported Democrat Hillary Clinton during the election, calling Trump “misogynistic.”Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other Commonwealth leaders are expected to receive invitations to the wedding because of their nations' ties to the British Empire.","The guest list for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's upcoming royal wedding has yet to be announced. However, speculation is rife as to who will be in attendance. President Donald Trump could potentially miss out on an invite due to the controversial nature of his presidency, whereas former US President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama may make the cut due to their amiable relationship with the young British royal and his elder brother, Prince William. Kensington Palace has remained tight-lipped on the subject, with spokeswoman Julie Barley stating that the palace is currently focusing on the happy news of the couple's engagement and that the guest list will be announced in due course. 
The Obamas were not invited to Prince William and Kate Middleton's wedding in 2011 due to the added security costs of protecting the then-president. However, they made an official state visit to the UK the following month. As security is no longer an issue now that Obama is no longer president, it is possible that he could be invited to the royal wedding.
President Trump's appearance at the wedding may be unlikely, as it would likely spark protests. His planned visit to the UK in early 2018 has already been cast as a working trip, and he will not be meeting the queen. The risk of protests at a royal wedding, were he to be invited, may put the couple off inviting the controversial figure altogether. 
It is expected that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other Commonwealth leaders will receive invitations to the wedding due to their nations' ties to the British Empire. Meanwhile, Meghan Markle has publicly expressed her dislike of Donald Trump and her support of his then-rival, Hillary Clinton, which may further fuel speculation about the guest list."
politifact15545,1,0,"8.9k SHARES SHARE THIS STORYPresident Trump made a barely veiled threat today on Twitter to Representative Maxine Waters (D-CA) after the congresswoman called for the continued public shaming of members of his administration to hold them accountable for the president’s heinous policies, particularly the immigration policy debacle that led to the separation of thousands of children from their refugee parents at the border.Congresswoman Maxine Waters, an extraordinarily low IQ person, has become, together with Nancy Pelosi, the Face of the Democrat Party. She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 25, 2018Trump, of course, lied about what Rep. Waters called for which was peaceful protests and public demonstrations rather than the “harm” he claims. The “Be careful what you wish for Max!” quote, however, was a dog whistle call to action for his supporters to attack Rep. Waters on par with his warning during his campaign when discussing Hillary Clinton that perhaps “the Second Amendment people” i.e., gun owners could solve the problem.While some people may consider Trump’s tweet as more cheap theatrics for his base, the president’s hate-mongering towards Waters has real-life consequences as the news today about a San Pedro, California man demonstrates.Anthony Scott Lloyd, 45, is expected to plead guilty today to a charge of threatening to kill Rep. Maxine Waters because of her criticism of President Trump.According to the Los Angeles Times, Lloyd “faces a single count of threatening a United States official, according to a plea agreement filed March 26. It is punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.”Lloyd’s plea details the voicemail that he left at Congresswoman Waters’ Washington DC office last October that used both a racial slur and an anti-gay epithet to refer to the representative and stated that:“If you continue to make threats towards the president, you’re going to wind up dead, Maxine, ’cause we’ll kill you.“The voicemail was forwarded to the FBI who investigated it and arrested Lloyd who claims that the call was a “spur of the moment” decision made while listening to conservative talk radio and that he had no real intention of following through with the threat.Unfortunately, we have no such assurances from the president himself, and given Trump’s penchant for simply ignoring the rule of law, that is a frightening proposition.The contrast here is stark between Trump and Waters and the other Democrats whose calls for peaceful activism through public declarations of disgust and shaming of deplorable policies and behaviors are met by Trump and his Republican enablers with threats laden with hints of violence.When those threats lead deranged Trump supporters to take action beyond mere threatening phone calls, the responsibility for incitement to violence will be squarely at Trump’s feet.Add your name to millions demanding Congress take action on the President’s crimes. IMPEACH TRUMP & PENCE!","President Trump issued a warning to Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) via Twitter after the congresswoman called for peaceful protests and public shaming of administration members to hold them accountable for the president's controversial policies, particularly the immigration policy that led to the separation of thousands of children from their refugee parents at the border. Trump, however, distorted Waters' message and called her an ""extraordinarily low IQ person"" and ""the Face of the Democrat Party."" The president's vague warning to be careful ""what you wish for Max!"" was perceived by some as an incitement to violence. Trump's hostility towards Waters puts her safety at risk, as demonstrated in the case of a San Pedro, California man who threatened to kill the congresswoman and is expected to plead guilty today to a charge of threatening a United States official. The contrast between Trump and Waters is stark: while the latter advocates peaceful activism through public shaming of deplorable policies and behaviors, the former responds with threats containing hints of violence. Should Trump's supporters resort to violence as a result of his rhetoric, the responsibility for incitement to violence will fall on his shoulders."
politifact13591,1,0,"It might be hard to believe, after all, many of us had used Vick VapoRub. It seems like a harmless ointment, effective for fever, nasal congestion, and many other affections.But this case will make people question its use, especially moms and dads with small children because it could bring fatal consequences to them.A Mexican mother tells her tragedy to warn other parents and avoid someone else going through what she’s living: the loss of her 2-years-old baby.When she came back from work, she came into her baby’s room. When she got near to kiss him, she felt he had a fever. She imagined it was just a common cold and thought about a home remedy to relieve him.She rubbed Vick VapoRub on his chest, back, and under his nose to help him breathe. She tucked him up and laid down next to him.She was tired, so she fell asleep next to her baby. Hours later, when she woke up, she noticed her son wasn’t breathing.She carried him and took it to the hospital to save him. But, sadly, everything was pointless, the baby had been dead for hours.The medical report stated the child died due to inflammation in the respiratory track, produced by the camphor contained in the famous ointment.She never imagined that home remedy would take his baby. She only wanted to help him breathe, and the ointment did exactly the opposite.The thing is, this remedy is effective for adults; however, for babies younger than two years old, the ointment increases the mucus by 60%. The mucus accumulates on the trachea and blocks the breathing.The label warns the ointment is contraindicated for children younger than 3 years old.Sadly, in the case of the Mexican mother, the warning went unnoticed. Using home remedies for several affections is something common in homes around the world, but we hope this story draw attention to this fact: when children are concerned, we must always read the labels and ask for the advice of experts before using any home remedy.We must not let a simple mistake take our loved ones; we must be careful and seek medical advice to treat any illness.","Vick VapoRub is a household name for many families. A quick and easy solution for fever, nasal congestion, and other minor ailments, the ointment has been widely used for years. However, one tragic case has highlighted the importance of caution when using the product, particularly with young children.

A Mexican mother shares her heartbreaking experience of losing her two-year-old baby after using Vick VapoRub to ease his cold symptoms. The mother applied the ointment to her son's chest, back, and under his nose before they fell asleep together. Hours later, she discovered her baby had passed away while she slept next to him.

Medical reports reveal that the child died due to inflammation in the respiratory tract caused by the camphor in the ointment. Although this remedy is effective for adults, for babies under two years old, it increases mucus production by 60%, which accumulates in the trachea and blocks breathing.

The label clearly warns that the ointment is contraindicated for children under three years old, and it is thus essential to read the instructions and seek medical advice before using any home remedy. While using home remedies may seem safe, this case serves as a stark reminder to carefully consider all products used, particularly with children's wellbeing at stake.

We must always prioritize safety and seek professional advice before treating any illness, to ensure that no simple mistake takes our loved ones away."

politifact14908,1,1,"Delta Force Raids Obama Stronghold in Thailand[Note: Please view our newest article on Trump’s attack against Deep State assets: FBI RAIDS HOME OF HILLARY CLINTON COLLABORATORDuring the pre-dawn hours on Christmas Day, Delta Force operators launched a precision strike against an Obama-controlled stronghold in Thailand, says an active Secret Service agent who claims President Trump green lit the operation following a series of telephone calls to United States military commanders and to Thailand Prime Minister Nik Bukharin.A Delta detachment, known as 1-SFOD in the Special Operations community, flew from Okinawa, Japan to the United States Embassy in Bangkok, and held position while Trump cleared the incursion with his Thai counterparts.According to our source, the Trump administration learned that Obama, by proxy, owned a mansion and a 400-acre estate on the outskirts of the city of Si Sa Ket, approximately 500 km from Bangkok. On paper, the land was owned by the allegedly defunct Solyndra Corporation, a startup solar company to which Obama gave 2.2 billion taxpayer dollars in 2009. Shortly thereafter, Solyndra declared bankruptcy, and the money vanished. Despite apparent poverty, Solyndra maintained real estate holdings valued at over 800 million dollars in a half-dozen Southeast Asian countries. The Trump administration connected the dots, linking Obama to the Thai property, after asserting Presidential privilege and subpoenaing flight records that demonstrably proved Obama had travelled to Si Sa Ket six times as president and an additional four times in the past year.In a June 2009 edition of the Washington Beacon, conservative author Thomas Clearwater wrote, “Solyndra does not appear to be a legitimate institution, and is likely a shell company or slush fund used or owned by Obama to launder his dirty money.”Our Secret Service source supports that contention.“Obama holds real estate, vast sums of currency, and shadow companies across the globe, under many aliases. He doesn’t keep them in his name, as that would be too conspicuous. The administration has learned about many of them and has been working with foreign governments to seize Obama’s illicitly gained assets. Many of these nations are not exactly friendly to the United States; we don’t know what Trump offered in exchange for rights to seize assets in non-extradition countries or put special operations boots on the ground on foreign soil. I’m sure the price way high. Clandestine missions are occurring right now. The Solyndra mansion was just one of many,” our source explained.At 3:00 am (local time), a pair of helicopters, including decoy craft, airlifted Delta to its destination. They found the mansion deserted; however, according to our source, the dwelling had been recently occupied. The unit commander discovered freshly chopped vegetables and lukewarm coffee in the kitchen; outside fresh tire impressions lead away from the compound. Someone, our source said, must have tipped off the occupants shortly before Delta arrived on scene.Still, Delta did not leave the location empty-handed. They seized several encrypted laptops and over 200 million dollars in gold bullion, in addition to dozens of crates containing Chinese manufactured firearms and explosives. Moreover, and perhaps most disturbing, a maze of underground tunnels, ostensibly used for human trafficking, ran for miles in every direction beneath the surface. Having gathered all available evidence, they requested exfiltration and handed-off control to Thai law enforcement.Under power granted by the ASEAN Declaration to Joint Action on Counter Terrorism, Thai officials confiscated the estate and all remaining possessions contained therein.(Visited 18,013 times, 4 visits today)","During the early hours of Christmas Day, Delta Force conducted a precise attack on a stronghold in Thailand believed to be under Obama's control, according to a Secret Service agent. The operation was allegedly authorized by President Trump following a series of phone calls to US military commanders and the Thai Prime Minister. The team flew from Okinawa, Japan to the United States Embassy in Bangkok, maintaining position while the operation was cleared. Intelligence gathered by the Trump administration supposedly linked a mansion and a 400-acre estate in Si Sa Ket, owned by a defunct solar company called Solyndra, to the former president. Flight records show that Obama has visited this specific site ten times in total, six times during his presidency and four times in the past year. They seized several encrypted laptops, over 200 million dollars in gold bullion, and dozens of crates containing Chinese manufactured firearms and explosives. Furthermore, the team discovered underground tunnels used for human trafficking purposes. Thai officials subsequently confiscated the estate and all of its contents following the operation. The Trump administration has said that it is currently undertaking similar clandestine missions globally as part of a broader attempt to seize the illicitly gained assets of Obama, who supposedly controls real estate, vast sums of currency, and shadow companies using aliases."
politifact15187,1,1,"Having teenagers act as figureheads for a movement has a certain quality that has not gone unnoticed in the wake of the March for Our Lives rally on Saturday.Judge too harshly, and you are attacking a kid who has balanced trauma with homework. Amplifying students such as Emma González has injected optimism among liberal activists in the grinding debate about the role of guns in society.[How the Parkland teens became villains on the right-wing Internet]González, 18, has been at the flash point of this dynamic, appearing in newspapers, on magazine covers and in a prominent spot at the anchor rally in Washington, where her speech, which included a prolonged silence, lasted as long as the six minutes it took a gunman at her high school in Parkland, Fla., to kill 17 people on Valentine’s Day.Gun-control advocates have held up González as a figurehead of the movement, splashing her trademark shaved head on T-shirts and viral images.Then, there is another viewpoint of her activism.A doctored animation of González tearing the U.S. Constitution in half circulated on social media during the rally, after it was lifted from a Teen Vogue story about teenage activists. In the real image, González is ripping apart a gun-range target.[NRA host taunts Parkland teens: ‘No one would know your names’ if classmates were still alive]The doctored image mushrooming across social media appeared to confirm the belief among Second Amendment absolutists that calls for stricter gun-control measures are transgressive, destroying the very foundation of the United States.The animation bounced around conservative Twitter before it received a signal boost Saturday from actor Adam Baldwin.He tweeted to a quarter of a million followers with a hashtag reading “#Vorwärts!” — the German word for “forward” and an apparent reference to the Hitler Youth, whose march song included the word.Not gonna happen. pic.twitter.com/4kKBcSqdCl — Gab: Free Speech Social Network (@getongab) March 24, 2018Gab, the Twitter-like social network that is a popular refuge for the alt-right, tweeted the animation on Saturday to more than 100,000 followers, then hours later asserted it was “satire.” It racked up more than 1,200 retweets. The still images, looking more sophisticated than the glitchy animation, went further, appearing to be taken as legitimate by some conservative-minded Twitter users.The pushback seems to have gained more traction than the original images, although that means the original images are also spread wider.Donald Moynihan, a professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, debunked the altered image, saying in a tweet: “Just a sample of what NRA supporters are doing to teenagers who survived a massacre (real picture on the right),” referencing a user named “Linda NRA Supporter” who posted the photo and whose account has since been suspended.Justy a sample of what NRA supporters are doing to teenagers who survived a massacre (real picture on the right). pic.twitter.com/czX7IHD8ur — Don Moynihan (@donmoyn) March 25, 2018Moynihan’s tweet keyed on an idea: Public moments by the Parkland students are being scrutinized and stretched to either bolster or tear down arguments on social media, built on the traditional debates made around the dinner table.Generally, one form of criticism of González and fellow students such as David Hogg, 17, has focused on their ages.They are too naive and young to grasp the extent of how money, politics and policy intersect, the argument goes. It was cemented in the right’s criticism of Hogg’s insistence that clear backpacks would infringe on civil rights.The online effort to defuse Hogg has paid off. The first “top news” video that appears in a YouTube search for “David Hogg” is a takedown from conservative outlet the Blaze. “It’s hard to not just go after this kid,” host Pat Gray said in the video published Saturday, describing Hogg.[How conspiracy theories about the Parkland attack enter the mainstream]Other elements of González have been used in an attempt to discredit her, online and off.For instance, some in conservative circles have circulated images calling attention to a Cuban flag sewn to her jacket.“Emma Gonzales, wearing the flag of an authoritarian communist nation. Makes sense, they both hate an armed citizenry,” one meme shared on Reddit’s conservative page r/TheDonald. It was shared on social media through variations of the theme, including one by conservative commentator Andrew Wilkow. González’s father migrated from Cuba to the United States.As The Post’s Samantha Schmidt reported, the flag came under attack Sunday from the campaign of Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa).“This is how you look when you claim Cuban heritage yet don’t speak Spanish and ignore the fact that your ancestors fled the island when the dictatorship turned Cuba into a prison camp, after removing all weapons from its citizens; hence their right to self defense,” said a post on King’s campaign page on Facebook. The post also included a photo of González at the podium Saturday.A self-identified conservative Parkland student also has been buttressed by the right, which thinks he identifies with its politics — a de facto foil to his classmates. Kyle Kashuv, 16, visited President Trump and five Republican U.S. senators just three weeks after the killings to offer alternatives in the debate.“The initial movement, in its purest form, was amazing. It got corrupted because now it’s represented as anti-gun and anti-NRA. ‘Boycott this, boycott that.’ It’s detracting from the actual discussions,” Kashuv told The Post’s Dan Zak about the work of his classmates.Since then, Kashuv has been an occasional guest on Fox News Channel, sometimes calling for middle ground with fellow classmates and among those who disagree in the debate. Kashuv has echoed critics on the right that a focus on law-enforcement failures, not gun laws, is the way forward.But he has also targeted his classmates on the conservative media circuit.Hogg’s comments at the rally were “egregious and inflammatory,” Kashuv said on Fox News on Saturday, and he has criticized Hogg numerous times on Twitter. On Sunday, Kashuv challenged classmate Cameron Kasky to a debate. His argument has been bolstered by the NRA, which has published videos decrying Hogg’s use of explicit language and suggesting his activist peers","The recent March for Our Lives rally has brought teenagers to the forefront of a movement aimed at enacting stricter gun control measures. Rather than attacking these young activists, we should admire the strength and balance they exhibit in the face of trauma and homework. For example, Emma González, a prominent figurehead of the movement, has made numerous appearances in newspapers, on magazine covers, and at rallies. Her speech in Washington, which included a prolonged silence, lasted as long as the six minutes it took a gunman to kill 17 people at her high school in Parkland, Florida on Valentine’s Day. While gun-control advocates have rightfully hailed González as a symbol of the movement, others have attempted to discredit her using manipulated images and derogatory remarks. It is important that we recognize the scrutiny and criticism placed upon these young activists, who remain strong in the face of opposition. It is time to listen to their voices and take action to prevent the senseless gun violence that plagues our society."

One of six children (and the only daughter), Nancy (Patricia D'Alesandro) Pelosi was born on March 26, 1940, and grew up in Baltimore's Little Italy.2. Pelosi's father, Tommy D'Alesandro, was a legendary Democratic congressman and Baltimore mayor. Her brother Thomas would also go on to become mayor of Baltimore.3.

A devout Catholic, Pelosi attended a Roman Catholic women's college, Trinity College, in Washington, D.C., where she met her future husband, Paul Pelosi, who was attending Georgetown. They eventually relocated to his hometown, San Francisco.5. Pelosi is mother to five—Nancy Corinne, Christine, Jacqueline, Paul, and Alexandra, all born within six years—and grandmother to five.6. Although active in politics her whole life—including stints as a leading Democratic fundraiser and chairwoman of the party in California—Pelosi didn't run for office until she was 47, preferring to wait until the youngest of her five children was a high school senior before running for Congress in 1987.7. Republican National Committee Chairman Ken Mehlman said that she was neither a ""new Democrat"" nor an ""old Democrat"" but a ""prehistoric Democrat."" Other Republicans call her a ""latte Democrat"" for her politically progressive views on the environment, women's reproductive rights, labor unions, and other issues.8. Pelosi has been a formidable force within the Democratic Party, raising more money than any other congressional Democrat–around $100 million since taking the reins of party leadership. And she has managed to keep the House Dems toeing the party line: According to Congressional Quarterly, House Democrats voted with the majority of their party 88 percent of the time in 2005, the highest total since CQ started keeping track in 1956.9. Pelosi learned the art of politics from her father, a practitioner of old-school politics. To practice her penmanship, ""Little Nancy"" was in charge of the book in which her New Deal father kept track of favors done and owed.10.

Pelosi's devotion to the Democratic Party was noticeable from a young age. When she was a child, a Republican poll worker offered her a toy elephant, but she refused to accept it.

This comes just hours after a man was dragged off of an overbooked United Airlines flight when he refused to get off the plane. He was pulled out of his seat and thrown into the aisle as seen on a video released on Monday.The baby, whose name has not been released, was left with a welt mark across his face due to the assault. Eyewitnesses say the little boy was screaming for about 38 minutes straight and the parents were asked by the flight attendant several times to “quiet that annoying ass baby down.”After the 4th attempt to get the parents to comply, the flight attendant erupted into a rage grabbing the baby from the mother’s arms and slapping him in the face. It took several passengers to subdue the United Airlines employee.The flight attendant was restrained in the back of the plane until the Pilot could make an emergency landing in Missouri. United Airlines released a statement saying the employee acted in a way that does not represent their company and has been fired.The little boy is said to be in stable condition with no life-threatening injuries. The parents say they are reaching out to an attorney, refusing to give any further statements.","During a recent flight from New York City to Chicago, an unfortunate incident occurred involving a 7-month-old infant and a flight attendant. This comes only hours after another concerning occurrence, where a passenger was forcibly removed from an overbooked United Airlines flight. Video footage reveals that the passenger was dragged from his seat and thrown into the aisle, causing alarm and distress among other passengers.

Eyewitnesses have reported that the flight attendant in question became increasingly frustrated with the infant's cries, and repeatedly requested that the parents quiet the baby down. After several unsuccessful attempts, the attendant allegedly lost control, assaulting the child by slapping him and leaving a welt on the infant's face. It took several passengers to intervene and subdue the United Airlines employee.

In response, the airline has released a statement condemning the behaviour of the employee and confirming that they have been terminated from their position. United Airlines has emphasized that this behaviour does not align with their company values and policies.

The infant is reportedly in stable condition and is receiving proper medical attention. The parents have declined further comment at this time, stating that they are seeking legal counsel.

This unsettling event raises significant concerns regarding the level of safety and security that passengers can expect while flying with certain airlines. It is essential that airlines take swift action to address any behaviour that is deemed inappropriate, and strive to ensure that all passengers are treated with respect and dignity."
politifact13687,1,0,"The Republican war on women continues unabated. The same week that conservatives argued in the Supreme Court that employers should be able to stop their employees from getting contraception outside of the company health plan, Indiana joined the ranks of states like Texas and Florida in passing a draconian law that purports to protect women, while in fact, endangering their health by making safe abortion much harder to get. And Gov. Mike Pence recently signed it. The bill is stuffed with as many asinine restrictions on abortion with an eye towards making abortion as miserable and humiliating an experience as possible, and ideally something women can’t get legally at all.Asked to comment on his approval of a piece of legislation that basically promotes hatred towards women once stripped of all the legal terms, Pence argued in an interview with The Huffington Post that “abortion as such was a mistake since the day it was first invented.” “So, let’s get that straight right away – I oppose abortion for any reason whatsoever because I believe that killing someone, or something, if you will, that hasn’t developed a consciousness just yet is the ultimate act of crime. And if we’re murderers of innocent beings who can’t defend themselves, how are we to expect people with a fully developed consciousness to stop murdering each other?” the Indiana governor said.“And as if that wasn’t enough,” Pence continued, “we’ve got this situation now throughout different states where some lawmakers allow abortion under some circumstances like rape or when the fetus is diagnosed with an illness, and others just flat out prohibit it. And that’s bad for a number of reasons. First and foremost – we can’t have this kind of freedom of choice. This is bad, let’s be clear. And that’s part of the reason why I signed this bill, because I believe abortion, or I’m going to flat out call it murder, this murdering of children has to stop and it has to be prohibited in every state. So Indiana is just a step in the right direction.”Pence also tried to offer his opinion on what would have happened had he allowed rape victims to still have abortion. “First and foremost, because this is such a sensitive topic, let me just say that I sympathize with rape victims not just in America, but around the world. I can only imagine what it must be like to experience such trauma,” he said. “However, that does not justify murder, not even that justifies murdering a baby, not in my book. Because what would happen? We’d then have an epidemic of women claiming to have been raped just so they could have an abortion. And that has to be stopped at all cost.”Donald Trump’s new running mate also said, “Basically, if I’d have said no on the bill, that would be just like giving out get-pregnant-without-fear cards, because at the end of the day, women could have unprotected sex without worrying about what they’d do in the event of pregnancy. And you know, it’s not supposed to be like that. That would be equal to me picking up a butcher’s knife and slicing people open in the middle of the street. That would be murder. And I’m not a murderer.”“And it gets worse – when you get an abortion, you get several days off of work and whatnot to recover. And there are a lot of crazy people out there. What if women would go out and get raped on purpose just so they could get off work? I mean, Indiana’s economy is struggling as it is, and having thousands of women absent from their jobs would be horrific for the state, I’m telling you. I made the right call and that will be confirmed in the long run,” Pence concluded.","Recently, Indiana signed a bill that some now perceive as detrimental to women's health. The legislation, aimed at reducing abortions, applies stringent measures that could make accessing safe abortion much harder for women in the state. Critics note the measures are morally contestable, and describe the importance of offering patients a range of legal options. Under the regulations, legal options diminish, not expand. Some believe it could lead to dangerous subversions; others argue that it serves a critical reminder of the importance of prioritizing the most vulnerable, including unborn children. At the core of the dispute is a fundamental disagreement over who has the right to decide the medical treatment of abortion. Awaiting a judicial decision, Indiana has joined a growing number of states seeking to redefine the abortion equation in America."

politifact15539,1,1,"Less than one week after kicking out White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and continuing to harass her family, “Red Hen” owner Stephanie Wilkinson finally received a bitter taste of her own intolerant medicine.When conservatives encounter someone with whom they disagree, they try to engage in meaningful debate. With liberals, there is only resistance. Instead of inviting civil discourse, leftist ideologues are resorting to suppression, harassment, and even physical violence in response to “problematic” ideas. Of course, they’re quickly discovering that their juvenile and fascist actions have consequences.On Friday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and her extended family members, many of whom are liberals, were forced out of the Red Hen eatery in Lexington, Virginia, by co-owner Stephanie Wilkinson. Although the party politely obliged the indignant staffers, Wilkinson proceeded to gather her comrades and stalk Sanders’ family at another restaurant, screaming insults and demanding they leave. Now that word of her behavior is national news, Wilkinson is being forced to live by her own principles.Red Hen co-owner Stephanie Wilkinson has not only been forced to step down as executive director of Main Street Lexington, according to Fox News, she’s also placed herself in the center of what could turn into a massive lawsuit for damages concerning the effect her discrimination against Sarah Huckabee Sanders has had on Red Hen establishments across the country. Along with her resignation from the organization, Wilkinson’s bigotry has caused unaffiliated Red Hen restaurants across the U.S. to suffer protests, negative reviews, and boycotts, CBS News reports.Main Street Lexington president Elizabeth Outland Branner offered a short response in reference to Wilkinson’s resignation, which is undoubtedly a move toward damage control for the group, which represents many local businesses.“Considering the events of the past weekend, Stephanie felt it best that for the continued success of Main Street Lexington, she should step aside,” Branner wrote in an email.Wilkinson has caused such severe damage to other like-named establishments that business owners are desperately addressing the public outrage by disavowing the disgraced liberal feminist and declaring that it is illegal to refuse service to customers based on their political leanings.More than 4,300 replied, including multiple tweets calling on the restaurant to condone Sanders and the Trump administration’s actions. The Red Hen answered the threats by defining “unaffiliated” as well as an explanation that it is illegal for businesses in the District of Columbia to discriminate against people because of their political views.Another Red Hen restaurant, this one in Swedesboro, New Jersey, also faced a slew of angry calls and social media posts for refusing to serve a woman who’d never stepped through their door.“Kindly check your facts before you erroneously defame an innocent victim on Facebook,” said a post on the family-owned restaurant’s Facebook page.The manager of a New Jersey-based restaurant with the same name lamented that their location’s rating has plummetted from “4.8 stars to three-point-something.” An owner in Saybrook, Connecticut, attempted to prevent this same damage by adding a pop-up box stating that their restaurant has “absolutely no affiliation with any other Red Hen restaurant anywhere else.”Wilkinson has defended her discriminatory actions, ironically claiming that she doesn’t enjoy “confrontation” but feels a moral duty to harass political figures and their innocent family members.“I’m not a huge fan of confrontation,” Wilkinson told The Post. “I have a business, and I want the business to thrive.” But, she went on to say, “This feels like the moment in our democracy when people have to make uncomfortable actions and decisions to uphold their morals.”When the mainstream media propagates that those with certain political views are “Na","The recent incident at the Red Hen restaurant in Virginia has once again brought to light the issue of intolerance and discrimination among political ideologues. The harassing behavior towards White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and her family at a restaurant, by co-owner Stephanie Wilkinson and her staff, has sparked a nationwide outrage resulting in protests, negative reviews, and boycotts of other establishments with the same name.

Wilkinson's actions have not only cost her the executive directorship of Main Street Lexington, but may also result in her facing a massive lawsuit for damages concerning her discrimination against Sanders. Her bigotry has caused the unaffiliated Red Hen restaurants across the country to suffer a backlash from the public.

Business owners are desperately addressing the public outrage by disavowing the disgraced liberal feminist and declaring that it is illegal to refuse service to customers based on their political leanings. The Red Hen restaurant in Swedesboro, New Jersey, faced a backlash for refusing to serve a woman who had never even been to the restaurant. Meanwhile, a restaurant with the same name in Saybrook, Connecticut, attempted to prevent similar damage by adding a pop-up box stating that they have no affiliation with any other Red Hen restaurant.

Wilkinson ironically stated that she does not enjoy confrontation, but feels a moral duty to harass political figures and their innocent family members. This justification for her discriminatory actions has only added fuel to the fire and intensified the backlash against her. As Americans, we value the right to free speech and peaceful political discourse, and it is high time that both sides of the political aisle come together and engage in meaningful debate rather than resorting to suppression and harassment."

politifact13560,1,1,"The announcement that Mall of America was welcoming its first black Santa Claus was greeted in many quarters as a good thing but, as might be expected in a country that has become increasingly more comfortable saying any racist thing that comes to mind, many were highly offended. Three years after Fox’s Megyn Kelly definitively explained to America that both Jesus Christ and Santa Claus were white men, Mall of America dismissed her advice and hired Larry Jefferson, a retired U.S. Army veteran from Irving, Texas to spend four days at the mall listening to the wish lists of children of all colors.Among many who were offended by this move was former half-term governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin. The sharp-tongued Republican wasted no time in condemning the company’s actions, going on social media and posting comments that called for boycotting and “running Mall of America into the ground,” on the basis of Santa “always having been white in the Bible.” “No, I refuse to believe that they went this far in trying to cater to the minorities, I thought the company had some backbone but I guess I was wrong,” Palin told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune.She also argued that hiring a non-white Santa Claus was “the last straw” in corporate America’s twisting of traditional, conservative Christian values, “because they realized they couldn’t make any more money off of the usual scams and techniques they’ve been using so far.” She added, “That’s why they had to come up with something new and out of the box, at least something that appeared that way in their minds. But, this proves that they have no morals and that they won’t shy away from even the most blatant twisting of traditional Christian values, just so they could make more money. I understand having to make a profit in order to get by and have a good life, but I don’t understand stomping on things that are holy and sacred in order to accomplish that.”“That’s why Americans, especially white ones, need to boycott the company and need to run it into the ground, so that they never ever come up with such an offensive and sacrilegious idea again,” Palin added. “The Holy Book always said Santa Claus was white and any kind of deviation from that, regardless of its magnitude, is a sin. And we need to make an example out of Mall of America. If we don’t, if we let them get away with it, what’s next? Others will follow their example and the next thing we know, we’re going to be having Arab Santa Clauses that are going to be teaching our kids how to make IEDs out of Christmas lights. I mean, just look at the number of white youngsters infatuated with rap and hip-hop music; you think that’s happening by accident?”“Nope, our children are systematically being indoctrinated into other cultures and interests that have nothing to do with traditional, white Christianity. The numbers of converts to Islam have also spiked, just as much as interracial marriages between white women and members of other ethnic groups. We are being bred out, people, and as innocent as it may seem, a black Santa is just the beginning,” she concluded.","Mall of America recently announced that it would be welcoming its first black Santa Claus, who would listen to the wish lists of children of all colors for four days. While many saw this as a positive and inclusive move, others were offended. Former governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin, took to social media to call for a boycott of Mall of America, stating that Santa Claus has always been white in the Bible, and hiring a non-white Santa was a deviation from traditional, conservative Christian values. Palin expressed concern that this move was part of a larger trend of corporate America twisting traditional values to make a profit, and argued that white Americans needed to take a stand and boycott the company to prevent further offense. However, it is important to note that such statements have no factual basis and are rooted in racism and intolerance towards diversity. It is crucial that we embrace inclusivity and kindness towards people of all colors and backgrounds, and recognize that a diverse Santa Claus can bring joy and happiness to children of all races and ethnicities."

What AMLO is asking his people is not a surprise…He has an actual strategic policy behind his plan.Apparently, he has been planning this for years but nobody really cared to pay attention.AMLO’s key economic plan for Mexico is to become wealthy, and recently he has received a broad mainstream Mexican understanding.Conservatives in the U.S. have no idea about Mexico’s plan, but the far-left and democratic immigration radicals sure do.Reported by 100percentfedup: Well…at least a leader of Mexico is admitting what’s been going on for a loooong time. The radical open borders element on both sides has been welcoming millions of illegals for decades. Yes, decades…Open borders advocates on the left see policing the border as a form of cruelty and American imperialism. There are also radical organizations that feel Mexico deserves a southern portion of America.La Raza aka “The Race” is a radical organization seeking open borders along with many of the George Soros-funded open borders groups:GEORGE SOROS’S OPEN BORDER FOUNDATIONS: An inside look at the machinations of the multibillionaire and his mission to destroy national sovereignty.THE FUTURE PRESIDENT OF MEXICO… Andrés Manuel López Obrador aka AMLO:(From the Daily Caller) […] “And soon, very soon — after the victory of our movement — we will defend all the migrants in the American continent and all the migrants in the world,” Obrador said, adding that immigrants “must leave their towns and find a life in the United States.” He then declared it as “a human right we will defend.”The Conservative Treehouse warns: It would take Mexico several decades to achieve a level of wealth even close to the U.S., and they have no structural (political) systems in place to form the foundation of such an approach. So, AMLO’s faster plan is to use migration into the U.S. to break down barriers, collapse the economic dam and allow the natural flood of U.S. wealth to flow into Mexico.From the Mexican perspective this is a pretty solid economic approach that just might work; and they have open-border comrades within the progressive, democrat, republican and corporate political systems (all over the U.S) who already support such a strategy.Read More","Illegal immigration is a critical issue that mainstream media must acknowledge and address given the current state of the world. While illegal immigration has been a problem for decades, it is only in recent years that more people seem to be doing so intentionally to defy the system. It is not feasible for individuals to mass organize without someone leading the charge, and that leader is Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, affectionately known as ""AMLO."" In his quest to make Mexico wealthy, AMLO has been advocating for his people to flood the U.S. border.

AMLO's plan is not sudden; he has been devising it for years. Despite his strategic intentions, conservatives in the U.S. remain unaware of his policies. However, the far-left and democratic immigration radicals are more aware and supportive of his mission. AMLO's long-term goal for Mexico is for it to become wealthy, and recently, he has received overwhelming support from politicians and citizens alike.

Open border advocates, particularly on the left, view policing the border as a form of cruelty and American imperialism. Additionally, there are radical organizations, such as La Raza, that believe Mexico has the right to a southern portion of America. Many George Soros-funded open borders groups support this belief as well.

Despite the potential economic benefits, it is not feasible for Mexico to become wealthy through migration into the U.S. alone. Therefore, AMLO's faster plan is to use migration to break down barriers, collapse the economic dam, and allow U.S. wealth to flow into Mexico.

It is critical for all individuals and organizations, including mainstream media, to recognize the seriousness of the issue and the clear motivation behind illegal immigration. Only through recognition and action can we begin to address this problem."

We need a great match. Not another rigged result that doesn’t pass the sniff test.“I like money as much as the next guy. But I like football more. I can’t stand by and allow rampant greed and cynicism to destroy the game I love. The little boy in me won’t allow it.“Football in America won’t recover from this.”Early reports stating Goodes had been shot dead in an “gangland-style execution” in New York City have also been scrubbed from the internet, but not before alert readers captured screenshots of the story.According to Goodes, the NFL have organized a “rigged game” that will earn “maximum revenue” for the league, and hundreds of millions for broadcasters and advertisers, but will leave increasingly jaded Americans with a bad taste in their mouth.“This is the biggest scam in sports history,” Goodes said in Minneapolis, according to reports. “The Super Bowl is already completely scripted out.”“How do I know it’s scripted? I’ve read the damn thing.““You need to understand the NFL is a $35 billion shared revenue corporation. Outcomes can’t be left to chance. Total league revenues are shared equally by all franchises, so they don’t care who wins or loses. Let me be perfectly clear here. It doesn’t matter to the franchise owners. It doesn’t matter to the players. But it matters to the league. Outcomes have been fixed to maximize profits ever since my early days here.”“The sad thing is that it’s legal. Can you believe that? It’s legal thanks to guys [entertainment laywers] like me.”Explaining that the NFL is officially registered as “entertainment,” Goodes said “The NFL has more in common with WWE than you could possibly imagine.”The NFL possesses an Anti-Trust Exemption to the law granted to it by President John F. Kennedy, which ultimately allows the NFL to classify itself as “entertainment” rather than sport, as well as incorporate itself as a single entity, instead of the 32 separate “franchises” they would want you to believe.In a 2004 lawsuit, the NFL argued they are not a collection of 32 teams in competition with each other. They argued they are a single entity, providing “entertainment” in the marketplace, and as such they are not subject to Anti-Trust laws.The only other “sport” that occupies this legal position is the WWE.How are games rigged?According to Goodes, the fat cat franchise owners and their pampered players do not care who wins, as long as they continue reaping the lucrative financial benefits provided by the system.“Have you ever stopped to wonder how Vegas makes the point spread line and over under so close every week? There is not one game where the result totally blows away the point spread or the over under. It doesn’t happen. Are they that good? Hell, no they’re not. Even the best of the best cannot get it so close every singl","e week."" 

Dan Goodes, who had been a longstanding entertainment lawyer for the National Football League (NFL), was recently discovered dead in his hometown of New York City after publicly criticizing the authenticity of Super Bowl LII. The circumstances around his death are still being investigated, but early reports indicate that Goodes and another man were found shot in a BMW 2 Series. 

Goodes had been representing the NFL in Minneapolis, where he was working in partnership with the Eagles and Patriots franchise teams on promoting the upcoming Super Bowl. However, after straying off-topic during a promotional event, he was physically removed from the premises by security staff, reportedly due to his claims that the game was ""rigged"" and ""totally corrupt."" 

In an interview with reporters, Goodes expressed his concern that the NFL had organized a ""rigged game"" that would maximize revenue for the league, its broadcaster partners, and advertisers. He argued that the outcomes of NFL games cannot be left to chance, given the league's $35 billion in shared revenue, and suggested that undesirable results are often avoided to ensure the maximization of profit. 

Goodes went on to explain that the NFL is registered as ""entertainment"" rather than sport, due to its anti-trust exemption granted by President John F. Kennedy, which allows it to be classified as a single entity instead of 32 separate franchises. He argued that this position is allowing the NFL to operate like the WWE, and its owners and players alike are highly incentivized to maintain the status quo. 

Despite the controversy surrounding Goodes' claims, it remains unclear as to whether his stances on the NFL were directly linked to his untimely passing."

The only food-related duty Lisa has done for the past six months is retrieve Trump’s orders from drive-through windows and scoop the President’s ice cream from the carton.”Mr. Trump’s favorite fast food choices are reportedly Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonalds, and he eats his fried chicken, burgers, and fries with a knife and fork according to a White House staffer who requested anonymity to avoid consequences from leaking about the President’s eating habits to the press.“It’s borderline creepy,” the staffer said. “The first thing Trump does with his fried chicken is pick off all the skin from every piece like he’s dissecting the chickens with a scalpel or something, and then he puts it all in a pile. Then he cuts off all the lean meat and throws it away, leaving just the pieces of fat which he then eats individually with pieces of the crispy skin he peeled off. It’s gotta be a warning sign of a serial killer or something.”Mr. Trump’s McDonalds habits are even weirder.“He orders the same thing every time,” said the staffer. “He orders two big macs, a large fry, a diet coke of course, and an M&M McFlurry that he has Lisa dig out and remove every brown M&M, and then he makes her dump out half of the ice cream and fill it back up with extra M&M’s. Then he cuts off pieces of his big macs and dips them in the McFlurry so every bite has ice cream and chocolate on it.

""It's kind of crazy because Lisa is such a good chef,"" said Kurt Reno, the White House aide who recommended Ms. Mead for the job. ""But Lisa feels insulted because the President has ordered fast food for literally every single meal he's eaten in D.C. The only food-related duty Lisa has done for the past six months is retrieve Trump's orders from drive-through windows and scoop the President's ice cream from the carton."" Mr. Trump's preferred fast food items are Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonald's, and it has been reported that he has consumed these meals with a knife and fork. According to an anonymous staffer, ""The first thing Trump does with his fried chicken is pick off all the skin from every piece like he's dissecting the chickens with a scalpel or something, and then he puts it all in a pile. Then he cuts off all the lean meat and throws it away, leaving just the pieces of fat which he then eats individually with pieces of the crispy skin he peeled off."" Mead's resignation is understandably related to the President's bizarre eating habits, as detailed above."

politifact14776,1,0,"Pope Francis’s latest controversial statement – that “Jesus is metaphorical, not literal” – has pushed the Catholic Church to the verge of open mutiny, with multiple Vatican cardinals going on the record declaring Pope Francis is the false prophet foretold in holy scripture and prophecy.The statement made by Pope Francis during Holy Mass in the Vatican on Sunday is the latest in a long line of unconventional statements uttered by the pontiff since he ascended the highest office in the Catholic Church, becoming the first jesuit pope in history.Since assuming the papacy in 2013, Pope Francis has operated as a mouthpiece of the globalist movement, taking every opportunity to push the New World Order agenda. A short list of Francis’s most controversial statements include:PREACHING THAT ‘JESUS TURNED INTO SATAN’Pope Francis went where no other Christian, let alone Pope, had ever gone before, accusing Jesus of “debasing himself up to the point of totally annihilating himself”, and “turning into Satan.”Hardcore Francis apologists claim the quote was taken out of context, but when the passage is read in it’s entirety it is clear that Francis meant exactly what he said.Making matters worse, Pope Francis later doubled down, spreading Satanic doctrine further, when he said that Jesus Christ “made himself the devil, the serpent, for us,” according to L’Osservatore Romano, the daily newspaper of the Vatican.PREACHING THAT RELATIONSHIPS WITH JESUS ARE ‘HARMFUL’The heretical statement by Pope Francis comes after he broke with centuries of Christian tradition earlier this year, telling a crowd of 33,000 Catholics in Rome that “a personal, direct, immediate relationship with Jesus Christ” must be avoided at all costs.“Having a personal relationship with Jesus is dangerous and very harmful,” the pope said during the June 25 speech.The unconventional teachings of Pope Francis have caused Vatican Cardinals and senior priests to turn their back on the pontiff and refuse to pledge obedience to him.OPENLY CALLING FOR ‘ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT’In July this year Pope Francis told the Italian newspaper La Repubblica that the United States of America has “a distorted vision of the world” and Americans must be ruled by a world government, as soon as possible, “for their own good.”The week before he also called for “a one world government” and “political authority”, arguing that the creation of the one world government is needed to combat major issues such as “climate change.”Speaking with Ecuador’s El Universo newspaper, the Pope said that the United Nations doesnt have enough power and must be granted full governmental control “for the good of humanity.”France’s Marine Le Pen described Pope Francis as a “globalist bulldog“. Vladimir Putin argued that Francis’s unconventional teachings disqualified the Pope from calling himself a man of God. Francis’s own Cardinals are in open revolt against him, telling anybody who will listen that he was installed in unusual circumstances, with the assistance of globalist powerbrokers like George Soros.Pope Francis’s anti-Christian teachings are forcing Christians around the world to confront the difficult question – is he the false prophet that will precede the antichrist foretold in holy scripture?","During Holy Mass on Sunday, Pope Francis made a statement that has caused controversy within the Catholic Church. He stated that Jesus is metaphorical, not literal. This statement is not the first time Pope Francis has uttered unconventional teachings since he became the first Jesuit pope in history. Some Catholics are concerned about his stance on the New World Order agenda. In the past, the pope has made other statements that his critics have found problematic. For instance, he accused Jesus of turning into Satan and said that having a personal relationship with Jesus is dangerous and harmful. Additionally, he has openly called for a one-world government. Some Catholics have turned their back on the pope and refused to pledge obedience to him because of his teachings. Some of them have even suggested that he may be the false prophet foretold in holy scripture."

politifact15591,1,1,"Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel has been fired for covering-up the truth about what happened during the Parkland shooting.According to reports, following a criminal investigation by Florida Governor Rick Scott, Sheriff Israel will be replaced as early as next week.From Big League Politics: Sheriff Israel is being removed from office for criminal issues, not malfeasance, following an investigation conducted by the office of Florida Governor Rick Scott. The source exclusively revealed to Big League Politics that Sheriff Israel is also allegedly being investigated by the IRS.The high-level police source within the Sheriff’s Office disclosed that over the last several months, four candidates have been interviewed to refill the position of Broward County Sheriff. One of the candidates who were interviewed is Emery Giany, a Republican Florida law enforcement official who is closely associated with Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi.During the IG’s testimony last week, FBI director Christopher Wray was asked about the Parkland school shooting. When asked, Wray declined to answer any questions about the shooting and Sheriff Israel, citing that it was an active FBI investigation. Following the Parkland shooting, Governor Scott called for Director Wray to resign over the FBI’s failure to properly investigate Nikolas Cruz, 19, the school shooter whose plans to carry out a school shooting were reported to the FBI twice prior to the shooting on Valentine’s Day.“We constantly promote ‘see something, say something,’ and a courageous person did just that to the FBI. And the FBI failed to act. ‘See something, say something’ is an incredibly important tool and people must have confidence in the follow through from law enforcement. The FBI Director needs to resign,” Governor Scott said.According to the source in the Broward Sheriffs office, Sheriff Israel’s removal revolves around a criminal matter that the FBI is aware of. Although his failures surrounding the Parkland shooting initially sparked the investigation, it isn’t the sole reason why he is being removed.The high-level source who wished to remain anonymous told Big League Politics that Sheriff Israel is already aware of the fact that he is being removed from office next week.Sheriff Israel has been under heavy criticism for his handling of the of the Parkland school shooting, which left 17 people dead. Following the Valentine’s Day school massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, it was revealed that police officers under Sheriff Israel’s order were called to the home of the Parkland shooter 45 times prior to the school shooting.It is unclear why law enforcement officials law enforcement at the Broward County Sheriff’s office and FBI failed to properly investigate Cruz, but their massive failure has been directly attributed to the loss of 17 lives in Parkland, FL.Since the Parkland shooting, a lot of unflattering information has come out regarding Sheriff Israel. Along with being a mouthpiece for Democratic politicians and gun control advocates, like Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz who he has been photographed with, Sheriff Israel and his department have recently made headlines for more controversy.In May, it was revealed that Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school and the Broward County Sheriff’s office were keeping quiet the fact that Sheriff Israel’s son, Brett, had allegedly assaulted a 14 year old student on campus in an act of bullying.Shortly after the Parkland shooting, cell phone video filmed by Cruz himself revealed that he himself felt bullied, which lead him to carry out a massacre on February 14, 2018 in a targeted attack against his former classmates.Most recently, Sheriff Israel received a massive amount of backlash after the Broward County Sheriff’s office tweeted a picture of a new custom made Broward sheriff’s car that read, “Our new #dodge #charger. Do you like the paint job?”The tweet sparked outrage online from Republicans and Democrats alike ","Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel has been dismissed over claims of a cover-up in relation to the Parkland school shooting. The decision to remove Sheriff Israel was made following a criminal investigation by Florida Governor Rick Scott. Reports suggest that Sheriff Israel could be replaced as early as next week. Sources reveal that Sheriff Israel is being removed for suspected criminal offences, rather than malfeasance, and that he is also reportedly being investigated by the IRS. Despite his public criticism of FBI Director Christopher Wray following the Parkland shooting, Sheriff Israel's own handling of the tragedy has been called into question. Police officers, under his instructions, were called to the home of the Parkland shooter 45 times prior to the school shooting. Sheriff Israel’s removal appears to be linked to a criminal matter that the FBI is aware of, although it is unclear why law enforcement officials failed to investigate the Parkland shooter properly. Nevertheless, their failure has been attributed to the loss of 17 lives. In addition to his handling of the Parkland shooting, Sheriff Israel has been heavily criticised for his close association with Democratic politicians like Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz, which has led some to speculate that his political views may have influenced his actions as sheriff. Other controversies relating to the sheriff's department include accusations of a cover-up over an alleged assault by Sheriff Israel's son, Brett, on a 14 year old student on campus, and a controversial tweet from the Broward County Sheriff's office about a custom made Broward sheriff's car."

The Chinese did, according to well-placed FBI sources.And while Democratic lawmakers and the mainstream media prop up Russia as America’s boogeyman, it was the ironically Chinese who acquired Hillary’s treasure trove of classified and top secret intelligence from her home-brewed private server.And a public revelation of that magnitude — publicizing that a communist world power intercepted Hillary’s sensitive and top secret emails — would have derailed Hillary Clinton’s presidential hopes. Overnight. But it didn’t simply because it was concealed.FBI bosses knew of the breach yet did nothing to investigate, seemingly trying to run out the clock on the alarming revelations to protect Hillary during her heated presidential campaign with Trump. So instead of investigating the hacking of Clinton’s server, FBI bosses sat quietly.And did nothing to confirm the Chinese assets were linked to their government. Or assess the damage such a tremendous breach posed to national security. Did the Chinese government access Hillary’s emails? The FBI didn’t care enough to investigate at the risk of besmirching Clinton and further soiling her during the election.Hundreds of top secret documents and even the president’s daily travel and security itineraries were on that server — and intercepted by a communist country — yet the FBI sat on the evidence. Likewise, all of Clinton’s and her inner circle’s outgoing emails were compromised as well, sources confirmed.Even the Inspector General had tipped off the FBI — specifically Strzok — about the foreign breach. Still, no timely case was pursued.That same cover-up pattern fits FBI bosses who time after time stalled and concealed other criminal intelligence on Clinton in the weeks prior to the election.We could write more detail here and ramble on and on but at this point, we simply ask.Is anyone going to go to prison for politicizing the FBI and covering up countless crimes committed by FBI personnel in a variety of coordinated schemes to protect Hillary and the Democrats?","Lisa Page, a former FBI lawyer who worked under James Comey and Andrew McCabe, has testified during two days of closed-door House hearings that she was instructed to hide the fact that China, not Russia, had hacked the DNC server. According to federal sources, Page named several high-ranking FBI officials, including James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, and Bill Priestap, alleging that they concealed intelligence that showed China had illegally obtained 30,000+ “missing” emails belonging to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. This revelation, if made public, would have had tremendous consequences for Clinton's presidential campaign, yet the information was suppressed. The FBI leadership sat quietly and failed to investigate the breach or the damage it might have posed to national security, even after being tipped off by the Inspector General. The larger pattern of cover-up and concealment, extending beyond the Clinton email scandal, raises concerns over politicization within the FBI. The question remains: will anyone be held accountable for the multitude of crimes committed by FBI personnel in their coordinated attempts to protect Hillary and the Democrats, or has the FBI's integrity been irreparably compromised?"
politifact11773,1,0,"335 SHARES SHARE THIS STORYRepublican attacks on transgendered Americans and the religious fight to keep gender a binary delineation took a turn for the bizarre this week when Virginia Republican Mark Cole filed a bill that would force schools to check the genitals of their students in order to ensure that they are using facilities reserved for their “anatomical sex:”Local school boards shall develop and implement policies that require every school restroom, locker room, or shower room that is designated for use by a specific gender to solely be used by individuals whose anatomical sex matches such gender designation. Such policies may also provide that a student may, upon request, be granted access, to the extent reasonable, to a single stall restroom or shower, a unisex bathroom, or controlled individual use of a restroom, locker room, or shower. Any student who willfully and knowingly violates this section shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $50. Civil penalties assessed under this section shall be paid into the Literary Fund. Any law-enforcement officer may issue a summons regarding a violation of this section.He did not deign to inform us how this would be accomplished, but it’s hard to imagine any scenario that did not involve adults inspecting the genitals of children before using the bathroom. Notably, it also provides for stigmatizing transgendered children by isolating them in a single person bathroom, which the Department of Justice ruled in June was a violation of the student’s rights. It is a disgusting show of transphobia that has no place in our public schools; the GOP must accept that America is a multi-gendered, multi-ethnic nation, and no amount of perverted laws is going to change that.Download our NEW Occupy Democrats app for your iPhone by clicking here or for your Android by clicking here.Add your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the President’s crimes.

The proposed legislation mandates local school boards create policies that prohibit transgender and non-binary individuals from using facilities that match their gender identity, potentially leading to genital inspections of the students. If found in violation, students can be assessed a civil penalty of up to $50. The policy also perpetuates discrimination against transgender students by forcing them into isolation in single-person facilities, which the Department of Justice deemed unconstitutional in June 2020. The proposed bill is not only discriminatory but also a gross violation of the fundamental rights of transgendered students and does not align with the inclusive values of America's diverse population.

politifact13982,1,0,"Recently, Republican Ohio Gov. John Kasich vetoed the so-called “heartbeat bill,” a measure that would have banned all abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, or before many women even know that they are pregnant. At the same time, Kasich signed a bill banning abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions only for saving a pregnant woman’s life or preventing the “substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.”“At the risk of sounding discriminatory, which is not at all my goal here, but at the risk of sounding like that, there is no way women should be allowed control over whether or not they are going to have abortions,” Kasich told the Ohio Daily Star. “Women are wonderful beings, they are kind, loving, incredible and a whole other plethora of adjectives could be used to describe them, but at the end of the day, I’m sorry to have to say this, but the honest truth is that women used to be all those things. The women of today are mainly opportunists and gold diggers, who typically get pregnant due to unsafe sex, or to get their partners to marry them.”He continued, “Our mothers and women of the old times were the women every man deserved and was blessed to have. Today, the situation is so critical that I honestly fear for the future of this country. And so, I was in a position to make a change and do something important, and so I did. And there’s one very simple reason why I did it. That’s that, if a woman these days is not intelligent enough to keep her legs closed when they’re supposed to be closed, if she doesn’t have the foresight to make sure she doesn’t get herself in a situation where she might be pregnant, then there is no way a woman like that can or should be entrusted with the decision of having an abortion.”“A woman like that can barely take care of herself, and we’re supposed to tell our doctors to perform an abortion on such a woman and kill her unborn child – a being who’s done no wrong and only exists as its mother’s mistake? Do you really want to put the men and women in our healthcare in that kind of situations? To literally force them to commit manslaughter?” Kasich said. “I don’t know about the rest of the people living in my state, but I for one am not comfortable with that one bit. And so I reacted and did what was necessary to prevent that from happening.”“And I’ll tell you another thing – as of recently, all cases of out-of-wedlock pregnancies in the state of Ohio will have to be approved by the state. That means that every single couple that becomes pregnant and isn’t married or at the very least engaged, will be scrutinized to determine whether the pregnancy was planned or accidental. And in the case of the latter, the couple will be fined a total of $100,000, with $70,000 of the fine being charged on the mother-to-be for not being able to not only use birth control, but having sex before marriage in the first place. Women in this country really need to learn to either keep their legs closed or their other orifices open,” the governor concluded.","Republican Ohio Gov. John Kasich vetoed a bill known as the “heartbeat bill” which would have banned all abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. Simultaneously, he signed a bill restricting abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy, except in cases where the life of the pregnant woman is at risk, or where a major bodily function is at risk of being substantially and irreversibly impaired. 

When asked about his decision, Governor Kasich responded by stating that his goal is not to discriminate against women. He believes that a woman's decision relating to whether or not to have an abortion should not be entirely in her control because many women these days are opportunists who often get pregnant through unsafe sex, or to manipulate their partners into marrying them. The governor argues that women in today's society should strive to have the same characteristics as those of women in the past, who were kind, loving, and incredible individuals - the kind of women every man deserved to have in his life. 

Governor Kasich also expressed concerns about the future of the country, especially for the healthcare professionals who might be forced to perform abortions on women who are unable to take responsibility for their actions. In his view, if a woman fails to take the necessary precautions to prevent pregnancy, she should not be given the power to decide the fate of her unborn child, a being who has done nothing wrong. To prevent such occurrences, Kasich has made it mandatory for all cases of out-of-wedlock pregnancies to be approved by the state, and couples will be heavily fined for accidental pregnancies. 

In conclusion, Gov. Kasich believes that women should learn to take responsibility for their actions and make better choices to avoid pregnancy, such as using birth control or avoiding premarital sex altogether. He firmly believes that the new law will help women make better decisions and provide the necessary intervention to safeguard their health and the future of their unborn children."

Next they will demand that Australian’s convert or be beheaded!It makes me sick that our children were denied the American flag under Obama, and couldn’t pray… but Muslim children can and do.. we are denied Christ but they are not denied Allah during school hours! This is wrong on more than one level! Next they won’t want to learn the country they have invaded history… because its not theirs!Muslims are nothing but foreign invaders with no intention of loyalty or assimilation into the country they go to.This what you get with Socialist politician bent on destroying their country.Do you think that immigrants should adopt the culture of their host nation or be allowed to force changes to suit them?","It is a question that has been asked in various forms for generations: should immigrants be required to fully assimilate into the culture of their host nation? For some, there is no question: those who choose to migrate should be expected to adopt and respect the values and laws of their new homeland. 

Recently, however, this issue has been thrust into the headlines with renewed fervor following comments by the Islamic activist group Hizb-ut-Tahrir. According to the group's spokesman, Unthman Badar, Australia's insistence on democratic values and a ""disputed view"" of history is actually a part of an oppressive campaign of ""forced assimilation"" aimed at the Muslim community.

Critics of this viewpoint argue that immigrants who cannot fully abide by the laws and principles of their adopted nation should not be allowed to enter in the first place. With such strict entrance requirements, the expectation is that those who arrive have made a reasoned, rational decision to adhere to the values and laws of the host country. If they cannot do so, the argument goes, they should not be allowed to enter.

This debate is not unique to Australia. It is one that has arisen in many western countries - the United States, much of Europe, Canada, and elsewhere - and it shows no signs of subsiding. Those who support assimilation argue that it is crucial to maintaining the cohesion and integrity of a society, while opponents of a strict assimilation policy say that immigrants should be allowed to maintain their cultural identity and traditions.

Ultimately, the question of whether immigrants should assimilate fully into their host culture is one that each society must answer for itself. But as the debate continues to rage on, it is clear that it is a question that will not be easily resolved."

Now the state of California has appointed its first “unprotected” illegal alien in state office after Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de León (D-Los Angeles) appointed Lizbeth Mateo an advisory committee.The committee’s formal name is a bureaucratic mouthful — the California Student Opportunity and Access Program Project Grant Advisory Committee, or “Cal-SOAP,” for short — but its mission is one that will be familiar to Mateo: to find ways to help students from underserved communities go to collegeMateo is aa 33-year-old attorney and civil rights activist who was born in Mexico and came to the United States illegally at the age of 14 with her parents, who are also illegal aliens, according to the Sacramento Bee. She often complains that illegal aliens are treated unjustly and are not adequately represented in state government. As a result, she describes her appointment as a means towards correcting that alleged injustice.Mateo said via Fox News – “While undocumented students have become more visible in our state, they remain underrepresented in places where decisions that affect them are being made.”Trending: Melania Just Fired Them ALL! ‘That Is Not Acceptable Here – I Won’t Allow It!’Senate Bill 174 made Mateo’s appointment possible by amending existing state law to allow the appointment of any resident over the age of 18 to a civil office regardless of citizenship or immigration status. California law currently states that someone is incapable of holding office if they are not a citizen at the time of their appointment.“California is stronger when we utilize talents of all our residents, and opening state and local boards and commissions to every Californian will allow us to better serve our diverse communities,” Sen. Ricardo Lara, D-Bell Gardens, and the bill’s author said in a statement. “Undocumented Californians are our neighbors, co-workers, and parents, and as lawmakers, we can’t make good policy if their voices are left out of the discussion.”It marked the first time the Senate appointed someone living within the borders of the United States illegally to a state post. De León’s office attempted to make the argument that the appointment was perfectly legal because Mateo’s committee is advisory in nature only and not delegated to adopt laws and regulations or allocate state funds.Mateo took to Twitter to celebrate tweeting – In #lawschool I often wondered if I was fit to b in #lawjournal, #mootcourt bc not many ppl w/ my same background did.

(@LizbethMateo) March 15, 2018Interestingly enough, however, Moteo seems to be confused about which country she prefers and which country has her loyalty. In a 2016 Facebook post that appears in celebration of her graduation from Santa Clara University School of Law, Mateo proclaims publicly in Spanish –“Everything is dedicated to Oaxaca, Mexico!! to that land that I miss so much.”If she misses it so much? Why does she not return? After all, it is her homeland and the country of which is she is a citizen. Yet here she is in America, in a country in which her very presence is in defiance of the law she swears to uphold both as an attorney and officer of the court, and also as an officer of the California state government.It is important to note that while Mateo is the first “unprotected” illegal alien to hold a state office, she is not the first elevated to public office in California. In 2015, the city council of Huntington Park, California, appointed two illegal aliens to city commissions, sparking a public backlash.De León and other state officials are stoking an ongoing confrontation with the federal government over federal immigration laws.Many were also quick to point out Mateo’s hypocrisy in her chosen profession in the law and in government with her own illegal status and refusal to adhere federal immigration law. One Twitter user asked Mateo some very pointed and direct questions – “As someone who studies and practices the law, how can you at the same time flout the very principles of justice that law and order is based on?!?! You are a fraud and should answer for breaking the laws of this land.”In #lawschool I often wondered if I was fit to b in #lawjournal, #mootcourt bc not many ppl w/ my same background did.

(Of those, about 60,000 attend community colleges, 8,300 are in the California State University system and 4,000 are on University","Illegal immigrants who are residing in California have been granted the ability to serve on state and local boards and commissions, according to a proposal introduced before the California state Senate. Recent news has announced the appointment of Lizbeth Mateo, a 33-year-old attorney and civil rights activist, as an advisory committee member for the California Student Opportunity and Access Program Project Grant Advisory Committee. This is a landmark moment, as Mateo is an ""unprotected"" illegal immigrant, who came to America illegally at the age of 14 with her parents. Despite her illegal status, Mateo has been granted permission to serve in this capacity because senate bill 174 amended the state law to enable the appointment of undocumented residents over 18 to civil office positions. This action has sparked controversy, as many question the appointment of someone who is technically in violation of the law she is appointed to uphold. However, some Californian lawmakers argue that the appointment represents the diverse community of California more fairly. The committee Mateo is serving on has been tasked with helping students from underrepresented and lower-income communities access higher education, a mission with which Mateo has personal experience. She has made it clear that she wants to represent the underrepresented illegal immigrant population and overturn the unjust treatment of undocumented peoples in California. In light of this historic appointment, many are wondering what impact it will have on the political landscape of California and whether it is a positive or negative development."

The White House is now free of all pagan gods and idols, and contains only Christian iconography.“Because apparently during the eight years when Obama was there, and maybe even some of the presidents before him, there were all kinds of idol gods and images and all kinds of artifacts in there that were demonic, even some of the stuff from the Clinton era,” Begley said.The White House pastor then related that the First Lady said, “‘You’ve got to get all of that out of there and send in some preachers and priests‘” – she wanted respected Christian leaders — to go in and cleanse the White House or, ‘I will not spend one night in it.’”“I have to say, when the president allowed 40 pastors to come in to the White House and anoint him with oil and lay their hands and pray on him—seven times he’s done this—that is unheard of,” Begley said. “We haven’t ever – the guy’s got flaws, we all do. But at least he is humble enough and recognizing that he needs God enough that he keeps bringing them in for the prayer.”Pastor Begley made his remarks during the Feb. 2 edition of Weekend Vigilante, hosted by Sheila Zilinsky.In his book, My Life, former president Bill Clinton confessed that he and Hillary hosted a voodoo ceremony where an alleged “spirit arrived,” possessed participants walked on hot coals and burnt their flesh with fire, and at one point, a person bit the head off a living chicken.A Wikileaks classified email released in 2016 also exposed Hillary Clinton for what she really is – an occultist who bows down to Moloch, the same pagan god they perform human sacrifice rituals for at the annual Bohemian Grove meetings.In a Clinton email from August 29 2008 published by Wikileaks, a senior government staffer writes to Hillary Clinton, “With fingers crossed, the old rabbit’s foot out of the box in the attic, I will be sacrificing a chicken in the backyard to Moloch . . .”Later that year Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta was also exposed dabbling in the occult. WikiLeaks emails revealed he and his brother Tony fraternized with Marina Abramovich at Satanic “spirit cooking” dinner parties, featuring pig’s blood, countless human fluids, and mock human sacrifices.With previous tenants like the Clintons and Obamas, and the kind of company those families kept, it is no wonder Melania Trump demanded the White House undergo a full exorcism before she set foot in the building.","According to White House pastor Paul Begley, First Lady Melania Trump requested a complete exorcism of the White House to remove any “pagan idols and demonic artifacts” from previous administrations, including the Clintons and Obamas. Pastor Begley recounted that Mrs. Trump indicated she would not enter the White House until it had been thoroughly cleansed. The process included anointing the premises with oil and prayers from Christian leaders. After all pagan and demonic items were removed, only a cross remained in the building. Notably, President Trump has allowed pastors to anoint him with oil and lay their hands on him multiple times, demonstrating a humility and recognition of the need for God. The request for an exorcism may be understood in light of previous occupants of the White House, including allegations of a voodoo ceremony hosted by Bill and Hillary Clinton, as well as Hillary's exposure as an occultist who practices human sacrifice rituals for Moloch, the pagan god worshiped at the Bohemian Grove meetings.

politifact15371,1,0,"President Trump and his administration just voted against a United Nations ban on the death penalty for being gay, making the United States of America (it’s hard to think this is actually really happening) just one of 13 other countries in the world to oppose such a historic vote.A few other notable countries who voted against the ban were China, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, and Egypt.The resolution wasn’t sought to ban the death penalty entirely, but instead to keep it from being imposed in a ‘discriminatory manner,’ particularly in six countries where the death penalty is used for people known to be in same-sex relationships: Iran, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Yemen, Nigeria, and Somalia.While some are saying that a ‘no’ vote might imply a rejection of the death penalty in general, The Human Rights Council resolution specifically stated that it condemned the “imposition of the death penalty as a sanction for specific forms of conduct, such as apostasy, blasphemy, adultery and consensual same-sex relations.”To have a ‘no’ vote puts the United States in a very select group of countries. Not exactly the best group to be in agreement with on an issue like this.Renato Sabbadini, the executive director of The International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, said:“It is unconscionable to think that there are hundreds of millions of people living in states where somebody may be executed simply because of whom they love.” “This is a monumental moment where the international community has publicly highlighted that these horrific laws simply must end.”Since taking office, Trump has made a number of political appointments and policy moves against the LGBT community, including:Having The Department of Justice and Department of Education rescind guidance that defended the rights of transgender students to safety use bathrooms at schools that correspond to their gender identity.Saying publicly that transgenders could no longer serve in the military, and then issuing a directive to the Department of Defense to implement such an order.Signing an executive order in March that rescinded an Obama-era rule that companies have to prove they treat LGBT employees fairly.Fortunately, the measure passed with 27 countries voting for it, but it still sends a chilling message about a new United States agenda on human rights.","The United States of America, along with thirteen other countries, recently opposed a historic vote in the United Nations on the ban of the death penalty for individuals in same-sex relationships. Notable countries who joined the dissent were China, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt. The resolution in question aimed to prevent the discriminatory implementation of capital punishment in six countries, where it is used for individuals in consensual same-sex relationships: Iran, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Yemen, Nigeria, and Somalia. It is worth noting that the resolution did not seek to abolish the death penalty altogether.

Despite the ambiguous nature of the resolution, international human rights organizations have condemned the decision of the United States. Renato Sabbadini, the executive director of The International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, stated that it is ""unconscionable"" to think that people may face death simply because of their sexual orientation.

This recent vote further highlights a worrisome trend of the Trump administration's policies towards the LGBT community. In recent years, the Department of Justice and Education withdrew guidance that protected the rights of transgender students, transgender individuals were banned from serving in the military, and an executive order was signed rescinding Obama-era rule that protected fair treatment of LGBT employees.

Although the measure ultimately passed, the refusal of the United States to join the 27 other countries in voting for this resolution sends a chilling message about the country's stance on human rights. The international community has come together in support of an end to discriminatory laws, and it is imperative that the United States join this effort."

The Commissioner of the NFL was under pressure to issue the first punishment for kneeling protests during national anthems and responded with this penalty. However, some people believe that since Alejandro Villanueva, an American army veteran, chose to stand for the anthem in protest, he should be exempt from the fine. In fact, 50% of the fine should go to him since he was bullied by his coach, team owner, and fellow players. 

Meanwhile, Alejandro Villanueva has publicly apologized for his protest. This has backfired and angered fans even further. The attack on the American flag by other players still remains a contentious issue. Clearly, the NFL is struggling to protect its ideology and enforce its belief system onto others. Villanueva was the sole member of his team to stand up for America and he was forced, under threat of harm to his life and career, to retract his patriotic actions. He deserves an apology from the NFL leadership and his former teammates. 

In a separate incident, Chief Paul Smith of Cecil’s Volunteer Fire Department No. 2 in Muse, Washington County, was rightly punished for making a racist comment about Steelers’ coach Mike Tomlin on Facebook, following the team's decision not to participate in the national anthem. Likewise, some believe that the NFL players should also face harsh penalties for their disrespectful behavior towards the national anthem and the President of the United States. This is causing outrage, and many voted for Trump because of this very reason. 

The NFL has received over $1.1 billion dollars in federal subsidies over the past 20 years. Fans are calling for the government to halt this funding as the current situation showcases that NFL players do not respect their fans, their country, or the President of the United States. Despite playing in taxpayer-funded stadiums, they behave in a manner that many feel is disrespectful and unpatriotic. It's time for the government to cut off NFL funding, and for the NFL to be held accountable for its actions, starting with an apology to Alejandro Villanueva, and penalizing those players who disrespected the national anthem and the President."

The white supremacist organizer of #Charlottesville was an Obama supporter & Occupy Wall Street activist https://t.co/hI5PxNUmb7 — Dinesh D'Souza (@DineshDSouza) August 15, 2017“Rumors abound on white nationalist forums that Kessler’s ideological pedigree before 2016 was less than pure and seem to point to involvement in the Occupy movement and past support for President Obama,” the Southern Poverty Law Center notes in their profile of Kessler.Kessler didn’t just support Obama; he visited the Oval Office in 2016. Here’s a photo of the two of them having a fun chat:The Democrat party wants you to forget they are the party of the KKK. The Democrat party wants you to blame Republicans. But let’s remember that socialism is inherently a leftist ideology.

Bummer in the article above is apparently photoshopped. Original picture:President Trump Destroys Everyone at His Wild Press Conference in Trump Tower 8/15/17Busted! Journos Rush To Spread Fake News Following Trump’s Latest Press ConferenceDonald Trump gave a speech addressing the violence this past weekend in Charlottesville.During his speech, the President asked if the “alt-left” bore as much responsibility for the chaos as its extremist counterparts on the alt-right. Following the publication of an erroneous transcript, journalists and liberal pundits are spreading fake news about what Trump actually said in a rush to condemn him.Politico’s White House reporter Annie Karni was among the first to falsely highlight that Trump had referred to the alt-right as “us” in his speech. “Just noticed the use of ‘us’ in this transcript,” wrote Karni in a now-deleted tweet.“Okay, what about the alt-left that came charging at us?” she wrongly quoted the president as sayingSpeaking to the press, Trump stated that members of the “alt-left” (which is commonly understood to be made up of Antifa, Black Lives Matter, and other social justice groups) were equally responsible for violence as their alt-right counterparts.In the speech, Trump clearly says “Okay, what about the alt-left that came charging at ‘em?”.@realDonaldTrump gave the media DAYS to call out the antifa, BLM, etc Instead the #FakeNews covered for them…today it blew up on them. pic.twitter.com/QqDgwenIZD — Paul Nehlen (@pnehlen) August 15, 2017As Karni’s tweet made the rounds on Twitter, some—including CNN’s Brian Stelter cast some doubt on the transcript. “Transcript may be funky,” he wrote.Others, like New York Times’ Maggie Haberman, were less discerning and more eager to spread the fake news to thousands of her followers.Haberman corrected herself after dozens of people who listened to the clip pointed out the falsehood.Despite her corrections, variations of the fake news continued to circulate on Twitter as some. One user, Brian Klaas, jumped to erroneous conclusions and wondered if Trump had made a Freudian slip. “Trump lumps himself with his white supremacist supporters,” wrote Klaas in a now-deleted tweet.The fake news stems from Politico’s inaccurate transcription of Donald Trump’s speech. A snapshot of the transcript on Archive.is reveals the presence of the fake quote.The updated version of the transcript fixed the error, but did not acknowledge that any edits were made. Following complaints on Twitter, the transcript has been updated with a correction ","Conservative author Dinesh D’Souza has claimed that the man who drove his car into a crowd in Charlottesville, killing one person and injuring others, was not a Republican as reported by the media, but rather an Obama-supporting Democrat and former member of Occupy Wall Street. The Southern Poverty Law Center also notes that the same man had voiced his support for Obama and the Democratic party. Although the Democrat party would prefer to forget its historical links to the KKK, it is worth remembering that socialism is a leftist ideology. The Left should be careful in its attempts to link President Trump to white supremacists, especially when their own party’s past and present links to KKK and Nazi ideologies are taken into account. However, it is essential that facts are reported accurately and with care during such emotionally charged times, to avoid spreading fake news or making incorrect characterizations."

Same way I still can’t believe that Trump is in charge,” Pitt stated. “In the simplest terms, what brings us together is good, and what separates us is bad.”“What I’m most hopeful about is that we’re a global neighborhood now, and we start to understand each other more and more — and yet, you see this reactionary push for isolation and separation again,” he added.“A Trump supporter is fighting against just about everything.

Returning to the show on Tuesday, Pitt expressed his concern over the worsening state of our planet due to the significant increase in carbon dioxide, which has transformed it into an uninhabitable wasteland. He further added that despite this, half the population remains in denial of this adverse effect on our planet. He also made a biblical reference while discussing the weather, stating ""The Lord saw the wickedness of man was great, and the Lord said, ‘I will destroy man, who I have created, from the face of the Earth.’ So don’t forget your sunscreen."" Coming to political issues, Pitt, despite belonging to a state that mainly supports Trump, questioned the reasons behind people's support for him. He added that he couldn't believe that Trump was in charge and that the idea of taking the country back was confusing since he wasn't sure where it allegedly went. Pitt concluded by emphasizing that good deeds bring people together, while separation and isolation are harmful. He remained optimistic about a sense of interconnectivity in a global neighborhood, even though there is a reactionary push towards isolation and separation. Pitt's message was clear that there is no future for America under the current administration."

Mr. Netanyahu is said to be rallying moderate Arabs to thwart Mr. Obama’s bid to become the Secretary-General of the United Nations after he leaves the White House next year.Mr. Obama has already discussed the issue with Republican, Democratic and Jewish officials in the United States, according to Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Jarida.Mr. Netanyahu recently is said to have gotten wind of Obama’s plans which he calls the Obama Project. “Wasn’t eight years of having Obama in office enough?” Mr. Netanyahu is quoted in the Kuwaiti daily as telling associates. “Eight years during which he ignored Israel?

politifact14818,1,0,"Before the Obama administration approved a controversial deal in 2010 giving Moscow control of a large swath of American uranium, the FBI had gathered substantial evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering designed to grow Vladimir Putin’s atomic energy business inside the United States, according to government documents and interviews.Federal agents used a confidential U.S. witness working inside the Russian nuclear industry to gather extensive financial records, make secret recordings and intercept emails as early as 2009 that showed Moscow had compromised an American uranium trucking firm with bribes and kickbacks in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, FBI and court documents show.They also obtained an eyewitness account — backed by documents — indicating Russian nuclear officials had routed millions of dollars to the U.S. designed to benefit former President Bill Clinton William (Bill) Jefferson ClintonBill Clinton's novel sees fastest fiction sales in two years From Singapore, skepticism and hope The Memo: Summit gives Trump political boost — with risks MORE’s charitable foundation during the time Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonSessions defends firing Comey, warns DOJ report could prompt more terminations Sanders gets best reception at early 2020 audition Hillicon Valley: DHS gets new cyber chief | White House warns lawmakers not to block ZTE deal | White nationalists find home on Google Plus | Comcast outbids Disney for Fox | Anticipation builds for report on FBI Clinton probe MORE served on a government body that provided a favorable decision to Moscow, sources told The Hill.The racketeering scheme was conducted “with the consent of higher level officials” in Russia who “shared the proceeds” from the kickbacks, one agent declared in an affidavit years later.ADVERTISEMENTRather than bring immediate charges in 2010, however, the Department of Justice (DOJ) continued investigating the matter for nearly four more years, essentially leaving the American public and Congress in the dark about Russian nuclear corruption on U.S. soil during a period when the Obama administration made two major decisions benefiting Putin’s commercial nuclear ambitions.The first decision occurred in October 2010, when the State Department and government agencies on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States unanimously approved the partial sale of Canadian mining company Uranium One to the Russian nuclear giant Rosatom, giving Moscow control of more than 20 percent of America’s uranium supply.When this sale was used by Trump on the campaign trail last year, Hillary Clinton’s spokesman said she was not involved in the committee review and noted the State Department official who handled it said she “never intervened ... on any [Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States] matter.”In 2011, the administration gave approval for Rosatom’s Tenex subsidiary to sell commercial uranium to U.S. nuclear power plants in a partnership with the United States Enrichment Corp. Before then, Tenex had been limited to selling U.S. nuclear power plants reprocessed uranium recovered from dismantled Soviet nuclear weapons under the 1990s Megatons to Megawatts peace program.“The Russians were compromising American contractors in the nuclear industry with kickbacks and extortion threats, all of which raised legitimate national security concerns. And none of that evidence got aired before the Obama administration made those decisions,” a person who worked on the case told The Hill, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by U.S. or Russian officials.The Obama administration’s decision to approve Rosatom’s purchase of Uranium One has been a source of political controversy since 2015.That’s when conservative author Peter Schweitzer and The New York Times documented how Bill Clinton collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in Russian speaking fees and his charitable foundation collected millions in donations from parties interested in the deal while Hillary Clinton presided on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.The Obama administration and the Clintons defended their actions at the time, insisting there was no evidence that any Russians or donors engaged in wrongdoing and there was no national security reason for any member of the committee to oppose the Uranium One deal.But FBI, Energy Department and court documents reviewed by The Hill show the FBI in fact had gathered substantial evidence well before the committee’s decision that Vadim Mikerin — the main Russian overseeing Putin’s nuclear expansion inside the United States — was engaged in wrongdoing starting in 2009.Then-Attorney General Eric Holder Eric Himpton HolderHolder redistricting group backs lawsuits for 3 additional majority-black congressional districts Liberal groups launches ads against prospective Trump Supreme Court nominees Ready for somebody?

The Justice Department also didn’t comment.Mikerin was a director of Rosatom’s Tenex in Moscow since the early 2000s, where he oversaw Rosatom’s nuclear collaboration with the United States under the Megatons to Megwatts program and its commercial uranium sales to other countries. In 2010, Mikerin was dispatched to the U.S. on a work visa approved by the Obama administration to open Rosatom’s new American arm called Tenam.Between 2009 and January 2012, Mikerin “did knowingly and willfully combine, conspire confederate and agree with other persons … to obstruct, delay and affect commerce and the movement of an article and commodity (enriched uranium) in commerce by extortion,” a November 2014 indictment stated.His illegal conduct was captured with the help of a confidential witness, an American businessman, who began making kickback payments at Mikerin’s direction and with the permission of the FBI. The first kickback payment recorded by the FBI through its informant was dated Nov. 27, 2009, the records show.In evidentiary affidavits signed in 2014 and 2015, an Energy Department agent assigned to assist the FBI in the case testified that Mikerin","The FBI had gathered evidence that officials in the Russian nuclear industry were engaged in corrupt activities such as bribery, kickbacks, extortion, and money laundering while attempting to expand their atomic energy business within the United States.

He claimed that the U.S. is turning into Sodom now that it has “enshrined sodomy into the United States Constitution” and cities like Houston are trying to “force women to go into men’s bathrooms and men to go into women’s bathrooms.”“Now it’s a constitutional right for sodomites to marry each other,” he lamented, warning that “the wrath of God is revealed against this stuff.” He explained: “I don’t want the wrath of God to hit this country, it’s a great country, I’d like to see America continue strong, but this is one way of weakening it. First of all, we’re going to have this financial collapse. We’re setting up for a massive financial collapse and I think if God is going to hurt this country that’s probably the way he’d do it.”At that point, a viewer called in and inquired Robertson whether his grim predictions of such a crisis can somehow be averted, to which Robertson gave a somewhat confusing answer: “I believe so, yes, but we need to stop spreading lesbianism and homosexuality in order to achieve that. And the only way to stop the spread of these diseases that are plaguing the country is to make some sort of obvious distinction between gay people and normal, straight people.”“I personally believe that we must impose a rule on the gay population that would require them to wear specially-colored clothes, for example. I’m thinking we need to go through the Senate with this and we need to make it official. That way, regular people would know that the person wearing the said color is a deviant sodomite and that they need to stay away from them at all cost, as well as keep their children away from their reach,” Robertson opined.The viewer then interrupted “The 700 Club” host to state that “that sounds awfully like what Nazis did to Jews in the events leading up to World War II,” referring to the fact that Jews in pre-WWII Poland and Germany were made to wear Jewish badges, or yellow badges, which were cloth patches that Jews were ordered to sew on their outer garments to mark them as Jews in public. It served as a badge of shame.“I don’t believe that,” Robertson quickly became defensive. “I am simply talking about protecting regular people in America, not setting out gays and lesbians as members of the population that should be tortured and slaughtered in concentration camps. Do you understand my point of view here?” the host asked the caller.“I do,” the caller replied. “But I also understand that you’re trying to do to gay people what the Nazis did to my people more than half a century ago.

Upon investigation they found a 21 year old male dressed as a clown eating a live cat who's legs were zip tied together. The cat was still crying for help as the individual was seemingly eating around the vital spots prolonging it's death. When he noticed the officers he started petting the cat and told the officers ""curiosity killed the cat, I wanted to see if it tasted like Chinese food."" He was non resistant during arrest however did not have identification when asked his name he always replied ""furball munchinsrein the clown"". In the holding cell it was reported he kept calling to a female officer ""here kitty kitty kitty"" she eventually approached him and said what he reportedly said ""I wonder if you taste like Chinese food come on just let me get one little bite"" and continued to bite at the cells bars. He is now in a high security prison for the criminally insane. It was reported that in the asylum he bit open his own fingers and painted himself as a clown with his own blood and refuses to answer questions and instead meows. His trial is on the 31st however police say they doubt he will ever be allowed back into society.","Late last night, Greensburg police received a distressing phone call from a resident who had heard alarming sounds originating from an alleyway near her house. On responding to this complaint, officers were not prepared for the ghastly scene that met their eyes. An investigation revealed that a 21-year-old male, dressed as a clown, was brutally devouring a live cat, which had its legs tied together. Despite the cat's cries for help, the perpetrator sadistically consumed the feline, gradually causing its death. It was only after being approached by the officers that the individual ceased the monstrous act, proceeding instead to stroke the cat. Upon inquiry, he offered the truly chilling explanation of wanting to test if the cat tasted like Chinese food, uttering the disturbing phrase 'curiosity killed the cat.' 

Despite his arrest, the perpetrator exhibited erratic and deeply disturbing behavior. He adamantly refused to provide an identification, claiming to be 'furball munchinsrein the clown.' In custody, he continuously called out to a female officer, ordering her to approach him while exclaiming his desire to taste her flesh, going as far as biting the cell bars. Subsequently, he was transferred to a high-security prison for the criminally insane. Reports suggest that he has bitten his own fingers and used his blood to paint the figure of a clown on himself. He now refuses to answer questions, instead choosing to emit animalistic meows, causing most to believe his insanity to be irreversible. Although a trial is scheduled for the 31st, it is highly unlikely that this individual will ever be deemed fit to re-enter society."
politifact14310,1,0,"By AM Conservative Post authorFareed Zakaria, CNN host of ‘Foreign Affairs,’ has in his private blog called for the merciless rape of white females by Islamic minority groups shortly after openly gloating over the rise in premature deaths of white males in his article in The Washington Post.Zakaria’s blog post unapologetically calls to increase the death rate of white Middle America by systematically targeting Caucasian females.“The white race is rightfully failing because it is a foolish, arrogant, and self-absorbed ethnicity that has racism infused into its very genes. While the sharp incline of the death rate of white males is a good start, the solution to the ‘white question’ will not be reached until there is a sharp decline in the population of white females as well. Much more needs to be done in this regard if this country is ever to advance from its ignorant backwardness towards being an actually inhabitable nation.Thankfully, the Prophet Muhammad has given us a foolproof way to speed up the decline of a vanquished nation by treating their women as our sex slaves. They may try and fight the unstoppable tide, but their resistance will grow only weaker as the white race loses its ability to keep its head above water. We may yet see some final convulsions before white Middle America is decreased to a manageable number where it can be more easily controlled.”The blog post was removed from Zakaria’s blog within a few hours, after it began to receive negative attention.CNN officials have refused to take action against their employee.“Every death of a white person brings tears of joy to my eyes,” Zakaria posted on his Twitter account shortly after having to remove his blog post, in what is believed to be a passive-aggressive response to his critics.Photo Credit: World Economic Forum","Fareed Zakaria, host of CNN’s ‘Foreign Affairs,’ has come under fire for a deeply disturbing blog post in which he advocated for the rape of white females by Islamic minority groups. Zakaria, who had recently celebrated the rise in premature deaths of white males in an article for The Washington Post, went on to call for a further decrease in the population of white Middle America by specifically targeting Caucasian women. 

Zakaria’s claims are reprehensible and directly at odds with the values of a just and equitable society. They are also completely unfounded and harmful to the progress of our nation.

Archaeologists associated with Niagara University of and master divers from the U.S Coast Guard were mobilized on site to determine what it was, and they soon realized that they were dealing with a German submarine that sank during World War II.A wreck recovery vessel of the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society was mandated to refloat the ship and bring it back to Niagara Falls, where it must be restored before becoming a museum ship. The delicate recovery operation took nearly 30 hours to complete, but the submarine was finally brought down on the bank with relative ease.The divers of the U.S. Coast guard braved the frigid water temperature to go attach cables to the wreck for the recovery operation.The submarine was identified as the UX-791, a unique experimental German submarine, based on the U-1200 model, and known to have participated in the “Battle of the St. Lawrence”. It was reported missing in 1943 and was believed to have been sunk near the Canadian coastProfessor Mark Carpenter, who leads the team of archaeologists, believes that the U-boat could have traveled up the St-Lawrence River, all the way to the Great Lakes, where it intended to disturb the American economy.A report from the dated from February 1943 suggests, that the ship could have attacked and destroyed three cargo ships and two fishing vessels, even damaging the USS Sable (IX-81), an aircraft carrier of the U.S. navy that was used for training in the Great Lakes, before finally being sunk by anti-sub grenades launched by a Canadian frigate.“We have known for a long time that the Nazis had sent some of their U-boats in the St-Lawrence River, but this is the first proof that they actually reached the Great Lakes,” Professor Carpenter told reporters. “This could explain the mysterious ship disappearances that took place in the region in 1943, and the reported “Battle of Niagara Falls” which had always been dismissed as a collective hallucination caused by fear.”The restoration of the submarine could take more than two years, but once completed, the museum ship is expected to become one of the major tourist attractions of the region.","This morning, divers from the U.S Coast Guard carried out a delicate wreck recovery operation to bring to the surface a Nazi submarine which had been discovered at the bottom of Lake Ontario two weeks ago. The submarine, known as the UX-791 and based on the U-1200 model, had been identified as a unique experimental German submarine which had participated in the ""Battle of the St. Lawrence"" before sinking near the Canadian coast in 1943. A report from February of that year suggests that the ship had attacked and damaged multiple vessels before being sunk by anti-sub grenades from a Canadian frigate.

The recovery operation was conducted by the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society after the U-boat was spotted by amateur scuba divers in January. Archaeologists from Niagara University and master divers from the U.S Coast Guard were called to the site to confirm the findings and determine the best course of action. After almost 30 hours of work, the submarine was safely brought to the surface and transported to Niagara Falls where it will be restored before becoming a museum ship.

Professor Mark Carpenter, who leads the team of archaeologists, believes that the discovery of the UX-791 is significant as it provides the first proof that Nazi U-boats actually reached the Great Lakes. Despite long being suspected, there has never been any concrete evidence of this until now. The restoration of the submarine is expected to take up to two years, but it is anticipated that it will become a major tourist attraction for the region."

An astringent search of public records is now revealing that between 2012 and 2018, Halper received a total of $1,058,161 from the Department of Defense.

According to the GFS model's projection on Friday, September 1 at 2:00 PM EDT, Hurricane IRMA is projected to travel up the East Coast, hitting New York Harbor at Category 5 strength, with winds surpassing 157 MPH. It is worth noting that the accuracy of computer models is not guaranteed, but if this projection is accurate, it could be catastrophic for the affected areas. Buildings and structures may not withstand such strong winds and may succumb to damage, while shattered glass propelled by such winds presents a significant threat to anyone in its path. This is unprecedented in history, and if this storm approaches as prophesized, it is urgent for people to evacuate as far west as 100 miles from New Jersey. The gravity of the situation should not be underestimated."

politifact15178,1,1,"George W. Bush has lobbed thinly-veiled critiques of President Donald Trump on his approach to the press and the travel ban from some Muslim-majority countries. | AP Photo Former presidents walk fine line in Trump’s America Trump's predecessors are trying to both defend their legacies and respect the unwritten rule of not undermining the current commander in chief.During his “American carnage” inaugural address, President Donald Trump sent a clear message: all of the presidents in recent memory have failed the American people.The harsh rhetoric of Trump’s inaugural address made an impression on his predecessors, with George W. Bush reportedly calling it “some weird s--t” and Jimmy Carter saying he “flinched” when Trump appeared to back off America's commitment to human rights.Story Continued BelowIn Trump’s America, the five living former presidents are walking a fine line, attempting to defend their legacies while also trying to respect the “unwritten rule” that former presidents avoid undermining their successors.“The immediate former presidents have been more active in their criticism of the current president,” George C. Edwards, a presidential historian at Texas A&M, said. “This kind of thing has been going on throughout history, but normally it’s not very much. This is very early in a tenure and to have former presidents being critical of the president… is pretty unusual.”As Obama returns to the public spotlight, his former aides have made it clear he has no intention of talking much about Trump. However, he’s made his displeasure clear.Obama, who campaigned heavily for Hillary Clinton, said he was “heartened” by the protests following Trump’s immigration ban targeting Muslim-majority countries. He also released a lengthy statement defending the Affordable Care Act against Trump’s attempts to repeal it.At a speech in Boston on Sunday night, Obama avoided mentioning Trump by name, but again forcefully defended his signature health care legislation and mentioned immigration reform. “I expect to be busy, if not with a second career, at least a second act,” Obama said Sunday.And on Monday, Obama’s aides aggressively pushed back against Trump for trying to blame his predecessor for the woes associated with Trump’s disgraced former national security adviser Michael Flynn. While Trump and White House press secretary Sean Spicer have repeatedly denounced Obama for not revoking Flynn’s security clearance, Obama aides told reporters that Obama tried to warn Trump about Flynn’s erratic nature.George W. Bush, meanwhile, has lobbed thinly veiled critiques of Trump on his approach to the press and the travel ban from some Muslim-majority countries. “I consider the media to be indispensable to democracy,” Bush said in an interview with “Today” in February. “We need an independent media to hold people like me to account.”As for the travel ban, Bush was restrained but clear in his concern. “I am for an immigration policy that's welcoming and upholds the law,” Bush said.Carter also voiced concerns after Trump’s inauguration. During an early April appearance at Emory University, he said he wanted to avoid addressing politics but he hoped the women’s movement would be “invigorated” by Trump and that he didn’t see “any glimmer of hope” from the administration on race and gender issues.Bill Clinton, who was harshly critical of Trump during the Manhattan businessman’s presidential campaign, didn’t mince words about Trump when he ran into a local newspaper editor while holiday shopping. “He doesn’t know much,” Clinton said in late December. “One thing he does know is how to get angry white men to vote for him.”George H.W. Bush, who has been in and out of the hospital, remains the only living president to avoid any political commentary.Criticism of the current president by former presidents is not completely unprecedented, however. For example, Herbert Hoover criticized Franklin D. Roosevelt, his successor.“We’ve seen some criticism already of the incumbent president, but that’s not really unprecedented,” Tim Naftali, a presidential historian at New York University, said. “If it continues at a drumbeat from former presidents, then it will be something new.”Current and former aides to the living former presidents say their former bosses are careful in criticizing the current occupant of the West Wing. Stuart Eizenstat, Carter’s chief domestic policy adviser and a former ambassador, said it usually takes an extraordinary occurrence for a former president to criticize a sitting president.“There’s a recognition that there is something so unique and special about the presidency, that, notwithstanding what might be very deep and serious policy differences and personal understandings, you simply bite your tongue,” he said. “You don’t try to undercut the president because you know what impact that would have had when you were president.”The most reliable politics newsletter.

Former aides say particularly on foreign policy issues, previous presidents and statesmen can be a valuable resource.“Most of the time President Clinton reached out to former heads of state, or people like Henry Kissinger or James Baker, they were usually foreign policy issues, where you had a perspective there that was pretty unique on dealing with a similar situation,” Mack McLarty, Clinton’s former chief of staff, said.For example, Carter worked with former President Gerald Ford on the treaties which turned control of the Panama Canal over to Panama. Eizenstat said Carter instructed negotiator Sol Linowitz to call Ford immediately after the deal was ratified.Others primarily use their predecessors for humanitarian trips. Harry Truman famously sent Hoover to address the post-World War II famine, and George W. Bush had his father and Clinton help with relief efforts for the tsunami in Southeast Asia and Hurricane Katrina. Most recently, Obama sent the younger Bush and Clinton to Haiti to help after the 2010 earthquake.“What would be really unusual is if no former president undertook any missions on behalf of the incumbent president,” Naftali said. “If we see that none of the former presidents want","Former presidents are navigating a delicate balance in Donald Trump’s America, treading a fine line between defending their legacies and respecting the unwritten rule of avoiding public criticism of their successors. President Trump’s “American carnage” inauguration speech directly implied that his predecessors had failed the American people. Reports suggest that George W. Bush called it “some weird s---t” and Jimmy Carter said he “flinched” when Trump hinted at rolling back human rights commitments. The five living former presidents are now striving to uphold their own records while abiding by the conventional etiquette of refraining from undermining the current commander-in-chief. “The immediate former presidents have been more active in their criticism of the current president,” said presidential historian George C. Edwards of Texas A&M. Edwards remarked that while such issues have arisen in history, it is unusual for them to be so public so early in a term. President Obama has been relatively restrained, speaking out in defense of his policies and criticizing Trump’s efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Meanwhile, George W. Bush has hinted at concerns over the travel ban and Trump’s approach to the press, stressing the importance of a free and independent media in preserving democracy. Carter and Clinton have also voiced their anxieties. While none of their comments are entirely unprecedented, it remains to be seen whether criticism by former presidents will continue at a sustained level. Regardless, the current and former aides of those presidents have stressed that caution is being exercised, recognizing the “unique and special” nature of the presidency and its office."

Upon completion of the study, it was found that 80% of the black men in Atlanta, Georgia are homosexual.However, due to the large amount of men unwilling to openly admit to being anything other than straight in our society, it is expected that the actual percentage of homosexual black men in Atlanta is much larger.​Reactions to the study included both joy and fear as both men and women across the country expressed happiness in the openness of the men surveyed or fear of the “rising number of gays,” says Rednecks Against Being Homo chairwoman Natasha Tarwater.​BDSM enthusiast Reginald Monroe of Atlanta, while walking his leather-clad male slave through downtown, said,","Atlanta, Georgia has been recognized for its population of African American men who identify as homosexual in recent years. However, this perception has only been a stereotype until the recent findings of a study conducted by students from Georgia State University. The study aimed to assess the sexuality of men in the city following the release of a movie, ""Dr. Satan's White Van,"" filmed in Atlanta by Tommy Wiseau. 

The study categorized the male population based on race, dividing them into black, white, Asian, and oreo. These categories were further sub-divided into heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, pansexual, and asexual. Upon conclusion, it was discovered that 80% of black men in Atlanta self-identified as homosexual. It must be noted that due to societal pressures, a majority of men may not have been transparent with their sexuality, suggesting that the actual percentage of homosexual black men in the city may be higher. 

The study resulted in varied reactions across the nation, with some expressing happiness in the openness of the men surveyed while others have expressed fear about the rise in numbers of homosexual men. Natasha Tarwater, the chairwoman of Rednecks Against Being Homo, said that there was a sense of both joy and fear. Notably, BDSM enthusiast Reginald Monroe, walking his leather-clad male slave through downtown, refrained from commenting on the study's findings."

While many politicians are as spineless and weak as can be, such as Merkel, Macron, and London’s Mayor, some are standing up to the atrocity that is Islamic Extremism.In an incredible turn of events, 139 out of 168 deputies voted in favor of an amendment which would allow citizens to carry guns and shoot terrorists on sight. “We do not want to disarm our own people at a time when the security situation is deteriorating,” Interior Minister Milan Chovanec said on Wednesday.Sputnik News, a news agency centered in Moscow, reports:“The new law states that Czech citizens have the right to acquire, keep and bear arms in order to ensure the security of the state.”“It means that the approximately 360,000 licensed gun-owners in the Czech Republic are allowed to carry their weapons in public and use them in case of a public order emergency, such as terrorism.”Millions of patriotic men and women are PROUD to stand with the Czech Republic, fearing that if we don’t take action, Islam will soon overtake our nation. Some of the more pathetic and pandering individuals, however, have criticized the new law.The Guardian compares the law to Hitler:“There is little to smile about, however, when Zeman sets out what he sees as the threat being posed by radical Islamists – and even “moderate” Muslims, who he says could be radicalised to commit terror attacks as ordinary Germans were once inspired to fanatically back Hitler.”Yes, that’s right—because apparently Leftists think that protecting your nation from a cult of death, that rapes women, stones gays, and beheads thieves, is somehow “intolerant.” Well do you know what most Americans think?You’re damn right it’s intolerant! Why the HELL should we be tolerant of a barbaric religion that wants to take us back to the 500’s AD? We shouldn’t! We value freedom and family, and we WILL NOT have our country overrun by Islam.Thankfully, despite the overwhelming Leftist propaganda claiming that the law is “unfair,” and “discriminates,” against Muslims, conservatives all across the world have had their morale boosted.Despite what liberals may say about gun safety issues, The Czech Republic is actually one of the safest nations out there—6th safest in the world, to be exact.“Although Western European countries such as France, Belgium, Germany and the UK have suffered several terrorist attacks in recent years, the Czech Republic has not seen any attacks. The Global Peace Index 2016 ranked the country the sixth safest in the world.”After the past decade of liberal policies, pandering to immigrants, and welcoming terrorists into our country with open arms, many are proud to see that Europe is beginning to stand up for itself. Hope may not be lost, after all.With the massive movement of grass-roots nationalism growing, from Nigel Farage and Brexit, to Donald Trump, to various countries exiting the EU and valuing their OWN citizens and heritage over others, it seems that Western Civilization has a fighting chance of surviving.","The European migrant crisis continues to devastate the region, raising concerns about Europe's ability to handle the immigration crisis it has created for itself. Some leaders of Islam have even gone so far as to claim that Europe will fall under the control of a caliphate within two generations. While some politicians, like Merkel, Macron, and London's Mayor, have been seen as weak and ineffective, others are taking a firm stance against the atrocity that is Islamic Extremism.

In an unprecedented turn of events, 139 out of 168 deputies have voted in support of an amendment that would allow citizens to carry guns and take immediate action against terrorists. Czech Interior Minister Milan Chovanec acknowledged the deteriorating security situation and stated, ""We do not want to disarm our own people."" According to Sputnik News, the new law grants Czech citizens the right to purchase, hold, and bear arms, allowing the approximately 360,000 licensed gun owners to carry their weapons in public during a public order emergency, such as terrorism.

While millions of patriotic individuals support the Czech Republic's action, a few have criticized the new regulation. They describe the law as a means to pave the way for Hitler's regime. However, this is a misconstrued notion considering that protecting your nation from a barbaric, destructive religion that harms individuals based on their sexual orientation, gender, and livelihood is necessary. Liberal propaganda that labels the legislation as ""unfair"" and ""discriminatory"" towards Muslims is refuted by conservative voices worldwide.

Despite concerns regarding gun safety, the Czech Republic has been ranked as one of the safest nations globally, securing its ranking as the sixth safest country according to the Global Peace Index in 2016. After years of liberal policies and reckless immigration policies, Europe is on its way to regaining its former sense of self. It is heartening to see a rise in grassroots nationalism, which has led to the emergence of politicians like Farage, Trump, and a push back against the arrogance of the European Union.

There is a fighting chance for Western civilization to survive, and many hope that the trend of prioritizing one's own citizens and cultural heritage continues. Hope is not lost yet."

It’s difficult to think of our favorite actors as such horrible people sometimes, but Hollywood is just filled with tree-hugging, self-righteous, Prius driving freaks. H/T: thelastlineofdefenseSpecial Agent Bob Argueta was barking orders at other people at the scene before we enticed him with jerky to give us a statement. Skip Tetheluda, whose jerky has landed more than a few exclusive interviews, says Argueta was told to take Depp deep and dark into the night, make sure they weren’t followed and bring him for advanced interrogation. He responded to allegations that this takes a joke by an actor way too far:","Actor Johnny Depp has been taken into federal custody for questioning after making threatening comments towards President Trump. Despite some assuming his remarks were made in jest, evidence has surfaced that Depp had made plans to carry out an assassination attempt on the President during the forthcoming election season. It has been discovered that Depp had maps and specific timetables detailing the planned attack. Furthermore, certain content found on his computer suggests that he may have been radicalized while researching for a role in Muslim waters. These discoveries are extremely concerning as they may reveal a potential terrorist threat to the nation's leader. Depp's arrest serves as a reminder that the entertainment industry should not be immune when it comes to national security issues. The seriousness of this matter cannot be underestimated, and those found guilty of such crimes will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law."
politifact13677,1,0,"BREAKING: Meryl Streep Just Got Fired From A Major Project For Lying About TrumpAfter saying 6 minutes of mean things about Donald Trump without ever once using his name, humiliating him in front of a crowd of Hollywood elites and millions watching around the world, Meryl Streep got word From Ron Howard that she was no longer being cast as an older, wiser version of Mrs. C in a reboot of Happy Days that was to make her millions.Streep was to team up with Otis Winslow of “Family Matters” so Happy Days could be written into this century, with multi-racial families, gender identity and the gays playing a role in the plotlines. Ron Howard was to take on the role of Richie Cunningham once again, and other original actors include the guys who play Potsie and Malph, a cameo by Henry Winkler while Jon Voight plays Fonzie and an attractive guy who isn’t worth less than the chick from Charles In Charge plays Chachi, who now loves a guy named Jeff. Scot Baio had to be ejected from auditions when he found out he didn’t get the part.Now the project is on hold as the other person cast perfectly for the role was Florence Henderson, who passed away recently, but producers are hoping to fill the gap with Deborah from Everybody Loves Raymond.Meryl Streep, who hasn’t worked a day since that movie about shoes with the cute girl with huge eyes, is said to be almost broke and that the millions from this project were to basically cover her retirement. The date for that has been moved up now that she’s been deemed overrated by Trump and irrelevant to most Trump supporters, which basically covers the known world and the leader of it.Comments","In recent news, it has been reported that Meryl Streep has been let go from a major project due to allegations of dishonesty towards Donald Trump. Streep had made derogatory remarks towards the President during a public event without mentioning his name. As a result of this, Ron Howard, the director of a reboot of Happy Days, in which Streep was set to star, has decided to rescind her contract. The new series was intended to incorporate contemporary themes such as multiracial families, gender identity, and LGBTQ+ representation into its plotlines. However, Howard was forced to pursue other options in light of Streep's behavior. The tragic passing of Florence Henderson, who was originally set to play the older version of Mrs. C, has complicated the casting process even further. Nonetheless, producers remain optimistic about finding a suitable replacement in Deborah from Everybody Loves Raymond. Streep, who has reportedly not worked since her appearance in a film about shoes, is allegedly facing financial difficulties and was counting on the revenue generated from this project to support her retirement. Nevertheless, her current standing as a polarizing figure in the political sphere and perceived irrelevance to Trump supporters has made her casting in this series a difficult prospect moving forward."

Either rising sea temperatures and depleted fish stocks possibly led the shark to adventure itself further into the Great Lakes region.” he admits, visibly puzzled. “It is also possible it traveled to the region through underwater tunnels that interconnect between the Great Lakes,” he told reporters.According to authorities more than a hundred people reported missing in the area in the last decade may have fallen under the fangs of the gigantic beast, several local residents even suspecting its presence for a long time.U.S. Coast Guards reassured local residents that the occurrence of such a predator in the region’s waters “is highly unlikely” as sharks are not well adapted to freshwater systems.In 1916, a deadly shark attack near Presque Ile beach, in Lake Eerie, made national headlines, forcing local authorities to ban swimming in the region for over 14 years until the ban was lifted in 1930.","The United States Coast Guard confirmed this morning that the recent capture of a 3,000-pound great white shark in Lake Michigan may explain the mysterious disappearances of several individuals in the area over the past decade. The massive fish was reeled in by Canadian tourist John O’Keef and Chicago resident Allan Brooks while fishing for sturgeon. Although it took several hours to bring the beast to shore, O’Keef reports that his friend eventually was able to wound the shark with a rifle. Measuring in at over 1.2 tons, experts believe this to be the largest fish that has ever been caught in the region. University of Illinois biology professor Allan Jameson finds the shark's presence puzzling, suggesting that rising sea temperatures, depleted fish stocks, or underwater tunnels that interconnect between the Great Lakes may have attracted the massive predator to the region. Reports indicate that more than 100 people have disappeared in the area over the past decade, with residents suspecting the presence of a great white shark for some time. While the Coast Guard assures local residents that sharks are not typically found in freshwater systems, the 1916 deadly shark attack near Presque Ile beach in Lake Eerie serves as a reminder of the threat that such predators can pose."
politifact15262,1,0,"One of the most contentious issues in the State of Missouri’s case against Gov. Eric Greitens has been the whereabouts of an incriminating photo that he is alleged to have taken and disseminated.A deposition of the woman (K.S.) in question, the woman who accused Greitens of taking a nude photo of her, reveals one new shocking bit of evidence. The woman may have dreamed up the incident at the heart of the criminal case.The defense team’s April 8 motion to compel immediate production of all exculpatory evidence reports the following exchange.When the defense counsel asked K.S., “Did you ever see [Greitens] in possession of a camera or phone?” she answered: “Not to my knowledge. I didn’t see him with it.”The question was then asked, “And as you sit here now, you cannot state under oath that you ever saw him in possession of a camera – with a camera or a phone?”K.S. replied, “Correct.”The counsel then asked, “And you can’t say you saw it on his person, you can’t say you saw him put it down in the kitchen, take it from the kitchen, or put it down anywhere in the basement. Those are all correct statements, are they not?”K.S. answered, “Yes. I cannot say.”Trying to salvage the state’s case, the Assistant Circuit Attorney later asked K.S., “Did you see what you believed to be a phone?”Here comes the shocker. K.S. answered, “… I haven’t talked about it because I don’t know if it’s because I’m remembering it through a dream or I – I’m not sure, but yes, I feel like I saw it after that happened, but I haven’t spoken about it because of that.”K.S. remembered the photo incident “through a dream”? Memories recovered through dreams have led to some of the great injustices in recent jurisprudence. To her credit, K.S. struggled to give honest answers to the questions she was asked, but her honesty has undone the remaining threads of a quickly unraveling case.As the defense counsel observed in the motion, the state was aware that recovered memories may have accounted for K.S.’s recollection, but state prosecutors failed to turn that obviously exculpatory evidence over to the defense. K.S. also failed to so share this revelation with the House committee investigating Greitens.Defense counsel insists that there is additional exculpatory evidence the prosecution has yet to turn over to the defense and has asked the court to order Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner to produce it.","The State of Missouri's case against Governor Eric Greitens has been mired in controversy concerning an alleged photo that he took and disseminated of a woman, referred to as K.S. A deposition of K.S. produced a startling revelation that may undermine the entire case. The defense counsel asked if she had ever seen the Governor in possession of a camera or phone, to which she responded that she did not see him. She further stated that she could not attest to seeing him put it down anywhere in the kitchen or basement either. However, the Assistant Circuit Attorney attempted to salvage the case by asking if she remembered seeing a phone. K.S. replied that she had, through a dream. Recovered memories from dreams have led to many injustices in recent jurisprudence, and this admission puts the entire case under question. The defense counsel has moved to compel the immediate production of all exculpatory evidence that had not been previously presented, and the court will soon rule on that matter."

It’s no longer political, it’s personal.Americans have had their eyes opened by the ascension of Donald Trump and no amount of leftwing money can put the Freedom Movement genie back in the bottle.Conservative Senator Ted Cruz made that observation after reviewing the results of the 2016 elections and the expectations of the voters.Cruz, who had the most high profile personality clash with Donald Trump during the Republican primary process nevertheless embraced Trump’s America First agenda and said, “If we’re given the White House and both houses of Congress and we don’t deliver, I think there will be pitchforks and torches in the streets. And I think quite rightly.”Candidate Trump promised many things – border control, lower taxes, fairer trade relations, a balanced budget, healthcare that puts the people first not the government, safer communities, and – to the extent possible – an end to foreign wars. What, among those promises, should any Republican, nay any American, have a problem with?After four months without a single legislative achievement, Congressional and Senatorial Republicans – notably John McCain, Paul Ryan and Lindsey Graham – have joined the Democrats in investigating President Trump absent a single shred of evidence that an underlying crime has been committed.So, what gives?Well, there was one additional promise that Trump made on his way to the White House that has some Republicans joining with Democrats and quaking in their boots, Trump’s promise to “Drain the Swamp.”As we reported yesterday, “An F.B.I. agent with ‘intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the Clinton case’ told us that they uncovered evidence of such massive corruption that the agents involved realized that damned near the entire government could be brought down.”The criminal co-conspirators in both parties realized almost immediately that the new sheriff wasn’t interested in joining them in the swamp so they launched, what can only be characterized as, a coup attempt.Democrats are well schooled in such things probably because of their close alliance with Marxist regimes that can only gain power by seizing it through bloody civil wars. It should be noted that the Democratic Party has already done this once before.One Hundred and Fifty-Seven years ago the Democrats waged a war against the First Republican President Abraham Lincoln for giving Blacks their freedom. That war came at a high price, as many as 700,000 Americans died fighting for what they believe in. To put that in perspective, these casualties exceed the nation’s loss in all its other wars, from the Revolution through Vietnam.Today, Americans are still prepared to fight and die to protect their children’s God-given freedoms. Despite what you are reading and hearing in the mainstream media, they aren’t the leftwing-funded rioters, the pussy hat-wearing feminists, or the cuck bois that cant handle a micro aggression. No, the Americans that back Donald Trump are well armed.Donald Trump’s presidency will move forward politically lest the sixty million patriots who voted for him, that are comprised of the large majority of military voters, police, and NRA members, move it forward by force.These patriots are armed, trained, prepared, and have proven their discipline. They have grown disgusted by the corruption in Washington and will do whatever is necessary to make sure Trump’s Freedom Agenda moves forward and under the direction of Donald Trump himself.No amount of fake news based on unsubstantiated charges by unnamed sources is going to change that. The battle lines have been drawn and no amount of finger pointing is going to convince these patriots to let anyone overturn the election results.So why are establishment politicians courting a bloodbath on the streets of America that will also threaten them personally when they could be part of Making America Great Again? It’s because they have been caught red-handed and up to their eyeballs in a worldwide criminal conspiracy that has nothing to do with politics and everything to do with defrauding the American taxpayers.And, now that they’ve been caught robbing the world’s largest bank – the U.S. treasury – they have chosen to go out in a blaze of glory rather than try to defend the indefensible at trial.Washington’s criminal elites have chosen to go to war to unseat our duly elected president.

House Oversign Committee Chair Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, asked for the alleged Comey memo and other documents. Chaffetz tweeted that he is prepared to subpoena the information. And Sen.

The President’s promise to “Drain the Swamp” and prosecute corrupt officials has caused alarm among the political establishment, leading to what can only be described as a coup attempt against the President.

politifact14893,1,1,"President Donald Trump has only been in office for a short time and he’s already caused so much anxiety to the country, including the intelligence community. Instead of continuing to be a punching bag though, one intelligence agency decided to fight back and they just sent Trump a message: they are watching him. In a twist right out of a Hollywood film, six White House staffers were escorted out of the White House for failing their background investigations. Here’s what WJ just reported:“The staffers were escorted from the White house Wednesday for problems with their SF86 application, the ‘Questionnaire for National Security Positions.’ The 127-page document includes questions on the applicant’s credit score, medical records, employment history, family history, substance use and other personal subjects.”The six staffers included the daughter of President Trump’s Florida campaign manager Caroline Wiles:“Wiles, who resigned Friday before the background check was completed, was appointed deputy assistant secretary before the inauguration in January. She will instead get a job at the Treasury Department, sources told Politico.”The form, called the SF86, is for anyone who is applying for a sensitive position in the U.S government. Depending on the level of clearance and the agency requesting it, information collected can go all the way back to the age of 18 and in some instances, a polygraph exam is required. Both the FBI and the CIA require polygraph exams for top secret positions.It’s striking that Trump had already employed individuals who had not yet passed background investigations. It shouldn’t be surprising then that intelligence agencies are refusing to share information with his administration:“Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, said in an interview with The Journal that the intelligence community considered protecting its sources and the people cultivating them to be ‘their most sacred obligation.’ Schiff added, referring to Trump: ‘I’m sure there are people in the community who feel they don’t know where he’s coming from on Russia.'”Just as was the case with Michael Flynn who just recently resigned over his shady ties to Russia, you can bet that this administration is being closely watched.Featured Photo by Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images","The United States intelligence community has expressed its concern over the actions of President Donald Trump since he took office. In an unexpected turn of events, one agency has decided to take action. It was reported that six White House staffers failed background investigations, and were promptly escorted out of the White House. The applicants had previously completed form SF86, the ""Questionnaire for National Security Positions"", which seeks detailed information on everything from credit ratings to medical records, in addition to employment and family histories, and even substance usage. This form is mandatory for anyone applying for a sensitive position in the U.S government, and the content can go all the way back to the applicant's age of 18. Depending on the clearance level, some individuals may have to undergo a polygraph exam in addition to completing the form. Alarmingly, these same individuals were already working in the White House before their background checks had been completed. As a result, intelligence agencies, including the FBI and the CIA, have refused to share information with President Trump’s administration. The intelligence community has emphasized their obligation to protect sensitive information, including their sources and methods, which may be compromised if not handled appropriately. Given the serious nature of the situation, the community is closely monitoring the activities of the Trump administration.

politifact13773,1,0,"A Japanese whaling crew has fallen victim to a dramatic full on assault by a school of killer whales, killing no less than 16 crew members and injuring 12, has reported the Japanese Government this morning.The crew of the MV Nisshin Maru (日新丸), Japan’s primary whaling vessel and the world’s only whaler factory ship, was forced to leave the deck temporarily as a gas leak was detected within the ship’s processing factory that resulted in the ship being temporarily disabled all while continuing to carry approximately 1,000 tons of oil.The resulting panic lead members of the ship to jump off the boat before proper emergency procedures were taken and lifeboats had been set to sea. The swimming crew members were then ferociously attacked by a school of killer whales, that decimated a large number of the crew within moments. “It was horrific” claims Asuka Kumara, a mechanical engineer who witnessed the gruesome scene. “The water was red with blood, there were bodies everywhere” he recalls in tears.Within 30 minutes of the incident, 16 crew members had disappeared into the ocean.The incident occurred in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary, near the South Eastern Coast of South Africa, a controversial area to be whaling as a recent international court ruling has ordered the country to ends its whale hunt in the Antarctic. The East Asian nation halted its annual Antarctic whaling mission after the U.N.’s International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled last march the hunt violated an international moratorium on commercial whaling.“It seems Japan just doesn’t give a damn about international law” explains environmental activist and spokesman for Greenpeace Canada, James Ben Shahali, based in Vancouver. “The waste of life is always a shame, but the whales are not to blame here, they were only doing what they are born to do: kill for food” he adds.Japan has slaughtered over 6,000 whales since commercial whaling was made illegal by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) moratorium passed in 1986.","This morning, the Japanese Government reported a devastating incident in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary. The crew of the MV Nisshin Maru, Japan’s primary whaling vessel and the world’s only whaler factory ship, experienced a gas leak within the ship’s processing factory resulting in a temporary suspension of activity while they continued to transport approximately 1,000 tons of oil. Amidst the panic of the situation, several crew members jumped off the boat before proper emergency protocols were taken and the life boats were deployed. These individuals were then met with a violent attack by a school of killer whales, resulting in the death of 16 crew members and injuring an additional 12.

These tragic events occurred in an area known for controversy due to recent international legal actions ordering Japan to halt their whale hunt in the Antarctic. Environmental activists and spokemen for Greenpeace Canada, James Ben Shahali, based in Vancouver, has expressed concern over Japan's demonstrated disregard for international law. Although this event showcases the dire consequences of Japan's actions, it is important to remember that the whales were only acting naturally in an effort to feed themselves.

This is not the first of such incidents, as Japan has killed over 6,000 whales since the implementation of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) moratorium on commercial whaling in 1986. The resulting loss of life highlights a broader ethical and environmental concern around unregulated commercial whaling practices."

politifact15109,1,0,"Michelle Obama has been mostly laying low on one vacation after another since leaving the White House, only to emerge when she sees an opportunity to publicly slam President Donald Trump. A lot of questions have come up about the former first lady, starting when Barack Obama was still the president and continuing on now as the two live very separate lives. Although she’s desperately tried to hide the truth for months, a doctor has recently revealed what she has diagnosed her with which confirms our suspicions as well as our fears.Many have felt that Michelle’s behavior in the final months of being the first lady was strange, even for her, and has only gotten more alarming since the arrogant woman left the White House, but perpetually tries to remain as the center of everyone’s attention. Much of the country is happy to have her and her husband out of politics and wish that she’d slip into obscurity, but she refuses. Now we know why.Michelle’s hate for America seemed to become more obvious as the grip of power she had while her husband was president started to slip away at the end of his second term as their eviction dated neared. Every chance she got to make disparaging remarks about the country, she took, which has been a habit that’s only gotten worse in her post-presidential life. Dr. Lauren A. Wright, PhD, who is director of investor relations at NV5 Global, Inc. and a member of the White House Transition Project, shed some light on why Michelle did this as result of what she unofficially diagnosed her with.Biz Pac Review reported on the issue at the end of Obama’s administration before Trump took office:Why is First Lady Michelle Obama suddenly appearing so many places disparaging the country in the last days of her husband’s presidency?Dr. Lauren A. Wright, PhD, who is director of investor relations at NV5 Global, Inc. and a member of the White House Transition Project, recently wrote a book entitled, “On Behalf of the President: Presidential Spouses and White House Communications Strategy Today.”Wright diagnosed Mrs. Obama’s recent behavior. She has become an attack dog in an effort to help Obama build his legacy as the last days of his presidency slip away.“She’s in legacy building mode. She doesn’t have to worry about the implications [of her remarks] for months to come,” Wright said. “This is the time she’s most free to say what she feels, what she believes, and what she wants the message to be for the public.”As First Lady, Obama has given more public speeches and indulged more appearances than any First Lady in history, Wright reported in her book.“I think what surprises and upsets people most often is that first ladies give more public remarks than vice presidents, and that’s been true over the last three administrations,” she wrote.Of her biggest, and most disturbing claims she made in her campaign of hate against the country was that America is a racist nation who needed her husband in office and that she’s now suffering a feeling of “hopelessness” with Trump in office. Doubling down on that disrespectful sentiment is that she said she was never proud of America until her husband got elected to the White House. It’s ironic how Michelle says Barrack was successful in inspiring hope in the nation after everyone overwhelmingly voted Trump in, desperate for the hope his predecessor promised and failed to deliver on.The best case of revenge was how miserably she failed at building her legacy and trying to save it in the final days, especially now, that Trump just took the final sledgehammer to her most beloved project. After her disastrous lunch program crumbled around her and even her biggest supporters were critical of the changes she made to school meals, her nemesis, Trump, came in and reversed all she had done. He then topped it off by giving kids back their chocolate milk that she had ridiculously robbed them of.Dean James from America’s Freedom Fighters let loose on Michelle and her nasty claims about our coun","Michelle Obama has been a subject of scrutiny, with many questioning her behavior in the final months of her time as First Lady, and since she and her husband left the White House. Dr. Lauren A. Wright, PhD, sheds light on Michelle's behavior and its possible underlying reasons. According to Wright, Michelle has become an ""attack dog"" in an effort to help her husband build his legacy. Wright explains that Michelle is in ""legacy building mode"" and that she does not have to worry about the implications of her remarks for months to come. As such, she is most free to say what she feels, believes, and wants the message to be for the public. 

One of Michelle's most disturbing claims against the country was that America is a racist nation that needed her husband in office, and that she is now feeling a sense of ""hopelessness"" with Trump in office. Michelle also claimed that she was never proud of America until her husband got elected to the White House. However, Wright points out that first ladies, including Michelle, give more public remarks than vice presidents. 

Moreover, Michelle's lunch program failed miserably, and even her biggest supporters criticized the changes she made to school meals. President Trump reversed all of Michelle's actions and gave children back their chocolate milk that had been removed under her watch. Many view Michelle's actions as revenge against a president who opposes her husband's policies. While opinions about Michelle vary widely, it is clear that her behavior has contributed to ongoing discussions about her legacy and her impact on the nation."

politifact14756,1,1,"Updated | A new book by Donna Brazile, the former interim chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), has been making headlines for its controversial claims about the 2016 presidential election and the Hillary Clinton campaign. But the provocative points start even before the first chapter, as Brazile reportedly dedicated the book in part to Seth Rich, the DNC staffer whose murder launched a conspiracy theory.Axios reported on Sunday that the book's dedication reads, “In loving memory of my father, Lionel Brazile Sr.; my beloved sister, Sheila Brazile; my fearless uncles Nat, Floyd, and Douglas; Harlem’s finest, my aunt Lucille; my friend and mentor, David Kaufmann; my DNC colleague and patriot, Seth Rich; and my beloved Pomeranian, Chip Joshua Marvin Brazile (Booty Wipes). I miss y’all.”Related: TV Ad With Russian Subtitles Questions Seth Rich’s MurderRich, 27, was fatally shot in July 2016 while walking home late at night in Washington, D.C. The police believe the shooting was a robbery gone wrong. But Rich worked for the DNC, and WikiLeaks published thousands of emails from the committee two weeks after his death. That timeline provoked theories that Rich had given the materials to WikiLeaks and that his death was an attempt to stop him from doing so, or to punish him for it.Media reports had characterized Rich as a low-level staffer, and his parents wrote in an opinion piece for The Washington Post in May, “Those who have suggested that Seth’s role as a data analyst at the DNC gave him access to a wide trove of emails are simply incorrect.”SAUL LOEB/AFP/GettyRich appears elsewhere in Brazile’s book, as the Post reported earlier in the weekend. She wrote that Rich’s murder haunted her and that she'd installed surveillance cameras at her home and would keep the blinds in her office window closed so she could not be seen by snipers, according to the Post.Keep up with this story and more by subscribing nowBrazile talked about Rich on ABC News’s This Week with George Stephanopoulos on Sunday. She told the host about her critics: “They don’t know what it was like to be over the DNC during this hacking. They don’t know what it’s like to bury a child. I did: Seth Rich.”Brazile had spoken publicly about Rich’s death before. In March, she said she was going to an Omaha, Nebraska, synagogue to speak about him. In May, she tweeted, “Seth Rich was a hard worker and proud to be an American. This desire to scar Seth’s legacy to his country and party is shameful.” About two months later, after Fox News published a since debunked story about the case, she tweeted, “Seth was a good soul and look at this shameful act.”Through spokesman Brad Bauman, the Rich family said in a statement, “Since Seth was murdered, Donna Brazile has been a great friend to the Rich family and has been extremely supportive of the family’s efforts to find Seth’s killers.”In the book, out Tuesday, Brazile also writes that she weighed the possibility of replacing Clinton as the Democratic presidential nominee with former Vice President Joe Biden, according to the Post. She also reportedly wrote that Clinton’s campaign headquarters seemed “antiseptic, like a hospital,” and that she felt as though the Clinton campaign was treating her like a “slave.” In an excerpt that Politico published on November 2, she wrote about how the Clinton campaign worked out a fundraising agreement with the DNC and exercised control over the party long before Clinton became the nominee.Former aides to the Clinton campaign have challenged Brazile’s claims. In a November 4 open letter, more than 100 former top aides wrote, “It is particularly troubling and puzzling that she would seemingly buy into false Russian-fueled propaganda, spread by both the Russians and our opponent, about our candidate’s health.”Brazile was not available for comment through her publisher, Hachette Book Group, or through Georgetown University, where she is a faculty member.

politifact14384,1,0,"Photo: Pete Marovich/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesPeter Strzok, the FBI agent who sent anti-Trump messages to a colleague while leading the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s emails and Russia’s involvement in the Trump campaign, has said he’s willing to testify before the House Judiciary Committee, or any other committee that wants to talk with him. This could lead to dramatic hearings, as Strzok could expose more information about those probes, and is central to President Trump’s effort to discredit Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.Reports last week indicated that House Judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte was preparing to subpoena Strzok as part of the House investigation into the FBI’s conduct during the 2016 election. Strzok’s lawyer, Aitan Goelman, said in a letter to Goodlatte released Sunday that the move would be unnecessary, as Strzok “intends to voluntarily appear and testify before your committee and any other Congressional committee that invites him.”The letter noted that Strzok cooperated fully with the DOJ inspector general, who issued a report last week that was highly critical of the agent. In the lead-up to the 2016 election Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who were having an affair, exchanged anti-Trump messages on their FBI-issued phones. In one, Page asked if Trump might become president and Strzok replied, “No. No he won’t. We’ll stop it.” The inspector general found no evidence connecting their views with “specific investigative decisions,” but said that comment and others “implies a willingness to take official action.”Strzok and Page said he meant Trump wouldn’t be elected, and noted that they did not do anything to hurt Trump’s odds, like leaking the existence of the Russia probe before the election. Goelman told the Washington Post on Sunday that there’s “no question” that Strzok regrets sending the messages, but that “I think what he was doing is expressing his political opinions in what he thought was a private text conversation, and he regrets that this has been weaponized by people with political motivations to try to discredit the Mueller investigation.”Mueller removed Strzok from his investigation several weeks after it started following the discovery of the texts.Goelman said that if asked to testify, Strzok would be willing to testify without immunity, and would not invoke his Fifth Amendment rights. He said the agent “intends to answer any question put to him, and he intends to defend the integrity of the Clinton email investigation, the Russia collusion investigation to the extent that that’s a topic, and his own integrity.”Trump reiterated his thoughts on the matter on Sunday night, which are not supported by the inspector general’s findings. The report did not cover the Russia probe, though that did not stop Trump’s allies from calling for Mueller’s immediate suspension.Why was the FBI’s sick loser, Peter Strzok, working on the totally discredited Mueller team of 13 Angry & Conflicted Democrats, when Strzok was giving Crooked Hillary a free pass yet telling his lover, lawyer Lisa Page, that “we’ll stop” Trump from becoming President?

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2018Strzok still works for the FBI, but it’s unclear what he does now. The inspector general referred him, Page, and three other people to the FBI office that handles disciplinary action.","Peter Strzok, the FBI agent who came under scrutiny for sending anti-Trump messages to a colleague while leading investigations into both Hillary Clinton's emails and Russia's involvement in the 2016 election, has expressed his willingness to testify before the House Judiciary Committee, as well as any other congressional committee that seeks his testimony. Strzok's cooperation could reveal vital information about these probes, which are central to President Trump's campaign to discredit Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. The House Judiciary Committee's chairman, Bob Goodlatte, had reportedly been considering subpoenaing Strzok, but his attorney, Aitan Goelman, stated that Strzok is willing to testify voluntarily, thus rendering a subpoena unnecessary. Goelman also emphasized that Strzok had fully cooperated with the Department of Justice's inspector general, who had criticized the agent's conduct. During the lead-up to the 2016 election, Strzok and Lisa Page, a former FBI lawyer with whom he was having an affair, had exchanged anti-Trump messages on government-issued phones. Although the inspector general found no evidence that Strzok and Page's views impacted any decisions, he affirmed that Strzok's ""willingness to take official action"" was implied. Goelman doubts that Strzok's messages will have any impact on Mueller's investigation and argues that attempts to discredit the investigation are unnecessary. Additionally, Strzok's lawyer has declared that if the agent is asked to testify, he is willing to do so without immunity or the protection of his Fifth Amendment rights, and he ""intends to defend the integrity"" of both the Clinton email and Russia collusion investigations, as well as his own integrity. While Mueller removed Strzok from his investigation after discovering the texts, it is currently unknown what Strzok's current role within the FBI entails, and he is one of five people whom the inspector general referred to the FBI's disciplinary office."

Until recently, she was fairly liberal, and a big supporter of Hillary Clinton.In a statement not long ago, Parton said she was inspired that a woman might be President for the first time in our nation’s history.“We’re doing good,” she commented at the time. “We got a woman that could go in the White House, so we’ve certainly come a long way in that respect.”Recently, Parton saw the light and realized that Hillary would be quite possible the worst person to be the champion for woman throughout the nation. She now understands that Hillary is a liar; she’s as corrupt as they come.Recently, Parton saw the light and realized that Hillary would be quite possible the worst person to be the champion for woman throughout the nation. She now understands that Hillary is a liar; she’s as corrupt as they come.In a more recent interview, she called Hillary “nuts” and that her campaign has been “just crazy.”The American News article used portions of a real interview Parton gave to CNN on 26 August 2016, presenting quotes from that interview inaccurately and outVIDEO:Related PostsVIDEO: DEPUTY FIGHTS ALONE AGAINST TWO SUSPECTS, THEN HERO CITIZEN JUMPS IN AND OPENS CAN OF WHOOP-AJanuary 22, 2018Gay US Olympian Spits On VP Mike Pence Because Of A False FactJanuary 22, 2018Sean Penn Runs His Foul Mouth At Trump For “Sh*thole” CommentJanuary 22, 2018","Renowned singer and songwriter Dolly Parton recently shared her opinion on the performance of President Trump compared to the previous administrations stating that ""Trump in one year is already better than 16 years’ of Bush, Obama 'put together'"". Despite efforts by some to impeach the President, Parton stands firmly in support of Trump.

Parton, who was once a liberal and a strong supporter of Hillary Clinton, has recently changed her views on the former presidential hopeful. In a previous statement, Parton spoke positively about Clinton's potential to become the first female President of the United States, stating that ""we’ve certainly come a long way in that respect"". However, she has since come to the realization that Hillary would not have been a suitable candidate to champion the rights of women across the country due to her perceived dishonesty and corruption.

In a recent interview, Parton voiced her opinion on the Clinton campaign, describing it as ""just crazy"" and calling Clinton ""nuts"". It is important to note that the American News article which quotes Parton inaccurately and out of context has used portions of a real interview she gave to CNN on 26 August 2016.

Regardless, Parton's stance on Trump remains unwavering and she stands with him ""now and forever"". Do you share her support for the President?"
politifact14810,1,0,"Federal Judge Peter J. Messitte has just ruled in favor of two attorney generals seeking to subpoena the Trump organization relating to President Trump unlawfully receiving emoluments from foreign and domestic governments.D.C. Attorney General Karl A. Racine and Maryland Attorney General Brian E. Frosh can now subpoena the Trump organization, thereby forcing them to preserve documents in relation to President Trump’s alleged indiscretions.The case advances a very high-profile attempt to see if President Trump is violating the emoluments clause of the U.S. Constitution, which precludes him from receiving gifts from foreign or state governments. The Trump Organization will be compelled to comply with the court’s ruling.“This ruling is an important first step in our litigation against President Trump for unlawfully receiving emoluments from foreign and domestic governments,” Racine said in a statement.Per the Post:Because Trump continues to benefit financially from his hotel, resort and golf properties — in some cases from clients affiliated with foreign governments — Frosh and Racine alleged in their June complaint that Trump had committed “unprecedented constitutional violations.” State spending that benefits the president may be considered a violation of the domestic emolument clause, which says the president “shall not receive” any emolument, other than fixed compensation, from “the United States, or any of them.”The Justice Department had sought to squash the subpoena earlier in September, but Judge Messitte wasn’t convinced with their argument.President Trump has been accused of profiting from the presidency, and this case will seek to prove that assertion.","Federal Judge Peter J. Messitte has ruled in favor of the subpoenas requested by the attorneys general of Washington D.C. and Maryland, Karl A. Racine and Brian E. Frosh, respectively. The subpoenas aim to gather information relating to President Trump's alleged violation of the emoluments clause of the U.S. Constitution. This clause prohibits the president from receiving gifts or emoluments from foreign or state governments.

The Trump Organization will be compelled to comply with the court's decision and preserve documents related to President Trump's potential indiscretions. According to the complaint filed by Racine and Frosh in June, Trump's financial gain from his hotel, resort, and golf properties raises concerns of unprecedented constitutional violations. This is particularly pertinent because some of his clients are affiliated with foreign governments.

The decision represents a crucial first step in the ongoing litigation against President Trump and his alleged receipt of emoluments. As Racine said in a statement, ""this ruling is an important first step in our litigation against President Trump for unlawfully receiving emoluments from foreign and domestic governments.""

The Justice Department had tried to block the subpoena earlier in September but their argument was not compelling enough for Judge Messitte. This case signals an attempt to determine whether or not President Trump has profited from his presidency. It will be a compelling and highly scrutinized legal process."
politifact15492,1,0,"January 2nd, 2005, was a very important day in seven-year-old Katie Flynn’s life.She was one of the flower girls at her aunt Lisa’s wedding, along with her younger sister Grace.Over 200 friends and relatives had gathered on a beach in Long Island to witness Lisa and David exchange their vows and join in holy matrimony.The guests watched on as Katie and Grace walked down the isle with their beautiful dresses and innocent smiles – but nobody could have known this was to be the last day of young Katie’s life.After a long day of love, laughter and festivities, the bride’s parents, Christopher and Denice, along with her sister, Jennifer, Jennifer’s husband, Neil, and their two young daughters, Katie and Grace, got in the limousine that would take them home.“I remember looking in on the limo and seeing Kate and waving goodbye and she waved goodbye and never thought that was going to be the type of moment where you’re seeing people for the last time,” the groom, David, told CNN.The limousine left the Long Island wedding and joined the highway. They could never have known that a drunk 24-year-old, Marin Heidgen, was also on the road. Heidgen, driving on the wrong side of the road, hit the limo head-on, causing a devastating accident.Police reports revealed that Heidgen’s blood alcohol level was more than three times the legal limit. He had consumed at least 14 drinks and had been driving at 70 miles an hour, on the wrong side of the highway, for at least two miles before the catastrophic accident occurred.The driver of the limousine, 59-year-old Stanley Rabinowitz, was killed instantly after being crushed by the engine. The bride’s father, Christopher, broke both of his legs in several places after being thrown to the floor. He later had to have one amputated. His wife, Denise, was also seriously injured, and little Grace was stuck in the folds of the wreckage.Despite having a broken back, Neil attempted to crawl from the car to seek help. Meanwhile, Jennifer, who had injured her foot, was desperately searching for Katie, who had been lying on the side seat at the time of the crash.Then, Jennifer Flynn came across something that no mother should ever have to witness – her daughter, Katie, had been decapitated by her own seat-belt.One of the first responders on the scene was Michael Tangney, the bride’s uncle and a policeman himself. He had been at the wedding just hours before:“I was walking to the rear of the limousine when a gentleman was coming away from it, and he said, ‘Don’t go back there. It’s bad,’” Michael Tangney said. “I opened the rear door to the limousine and realized it was my family.”But, tragically, the worst was yet to come.Michael Tagney would witness Jennifer emerging from the wreck with her daughter’s head in her hands. Katie’s body remained in the car, still in the dress she had proudly worn for the wedding only a few hours previous.For the next hour, Jennifer sat next to the road. She kept Katie’s head on her lap and watched as the rest of her family was freed from the wreckage of the destroyed vehicle.Eventually, she let her daughter go; handing her to Michael. Before she did so, she kissed her daughter’s face one last time.The event altered the lives of the whole family. Martin Heidgen was sentenced to 18 years in prison for two counts of second-degree murder – though nothing, of course, can ever bring back Jennifer’s daughter.Jennifer and Neil have bravely chosen to talk openly about their story, in the hope that it might prevent a similar catastrophe from happening again.“Since no one should have to live the life I do, I felt a responsibility, an obligation, to stand up and tell our story,” Jennifer said.“I hope that by experiencing the devastation that we survived that night, and still continue to live through, people can see the seriousness of drunk driving as the crime it really is. Hopefully we will save more in the future.”The fact that people still drive drunk will come as no surprise to you.I’m sure y","ou’ve heard the countless tragic stories that come with the harsh reality. But perhaps few are as heart-wrenching as that of the Flynn family.

On January 2nd, 2005, the family was celebrating the love and union of Katie Flynn’s aunt Lisa and her new husband, David, at a beach wedding in Long Island. Katie, only seven years old, was one of the flower girls and got to share in the magic of the day with her younger sister Grace.

But as the festivities came to a close, the family got into a limousine to head home. Unbeknownst to them, a drunk 24-year-old by the name of Martin Heidgen was driving on the wrong side of the highway, having consumed at least 14 drinks that evening. He collided head-on with the limousine, causing a catastrophic accident.

The driver of the limousine was killed instantly, and the bride’s father and mother suffered serious injuries. To make matters worse, Jennifer Flynn discovered her daughter, Katie, had been decapitated by her own seat-belt. She held her daughter’s head in her hands, still in the dress she had worn for the wedding just hours before.

Michael Tangney, a policeman and the bride’s uncle, witnessed the horror as it unfolded. Though Martin Heidgen was sentenced to 18 years in prison for two counts of second-degree murder, nothing can bring back Jennifer’s daughter.

Jennifer and Neil have bravely shared their story in the hopes that it might prevent similar tragedies from happening in the future. They hope that by experiencing the devastation that they have survived, people can see the severity of drunk driving as the crime it truly is.

The Flynn family’s heartbreaking loss serves as a reminder of the devastating consequences that come with such recklessness. Let us remember their story and work towards a safer future for all."
politifact15494,1,0,"A dispute in Angela Merkel’s coalition over migration policy has swiftly escalated into one of the biggest tests of her chancellorship.The clash has opened a rift at the heart of the German leader’s own camp, between her Christian Democratic Union and its CSU Bavarian sister party. How the conflict is resolved will determine the chancellor’s fate, possibly as soon as Monday.Horst Seehofer, Merkel’s interior minister and the leader of Bavaria’s Christian Social Union, wants to force through a plan to send back migrants who have already registered for asylum in other European Union states. Merkel rejects the proposal as offloading the burden on neighboring states, and says it would kill efforts to forge a bloc-wide response to the continent’s struggle with migration.Bavarian lawmakers are fully behind Seehofer, while Merkel has wrested a majority in the larger CDU group for her position. The standoff is a replay of tensions that have periodically bubbled up between Merkel and Seehofer since the height of the refugee crisis in 2015 and 2016, only this time there is no obvious way out. Following are some potential scenarios:CompromiseThe two parties have managed to eke out a compromise after each previous conflict. Overtures could begin on Monday, when the CSU party executive meets in Munich. Seehofer could give Merkel what she wants: two weeks to forge bilateral accords with countries such as Italy and Greece to return registered asylum seekers.Merkel could also give ground, as for example the newspaper Die Welt advocates. She could put forward another proposal to assuage the CSU that may yield a compromise. But if she caves in to the Bavarian demands as they stand, it would be an unprecedented loss of authority that would render her a lame duck leader.No CompromiseIn the absence of a face-saving deal, the real clash could come as early as Monday. That’s when Seehofer has indicated he will start to implement his plan at the border. As interior minister, Seehofer has the authority to do so, even in the face of Merkel’s rejection. The only way for the chancellor to forestall a unilateral decision by her minister would be to fire him. Sacking her top Bavarian ally would be a historic first. If it happens, it’s hard to see how the coalition continues.Even if it doesn’t come to that and Merkel is given until the June 28-29 EU summit to reach bilateral agreements, it may only delayed the clash, since there is no guarantee she can win deals with other other EU states. She has already called the prospect ambitious.Confidence voteFor a coalition to dissolve, the German constitution says the lower house of parliament, or Bundestag, has to call a vote of confidence. The CDU and CSU, with a combined 246 seats, and the SPD with 153, have a majority of 44 seats in the 709-seat Bundestag. Such a move would be the ultimate measure of support for Merkel as chancellor. Even if she is unable to rely on the CSU, or indeed all of her own party’s votes, on the specific issue of her stand on migration Merkel might be able to attract the support of the Greens, which have 67 seats.Germany’s Sueddeutsche Zeitung said in an opinion piece on Friday that Merkel should short-circuit the squabbling and put her parliamentary support to the test with a confidence vote. It’s a tactic that her predecessor, Social Democrat Gerhard Schroeder, used to force through military support for the U.S. after the Sept. 11 attacks. He used it again in 2005 amid a party rebellion, and this time lost the confidence motion, forcing new elections.Merkel resignsShould the chancellor view her authority as irretrievably compromised, she could throw in the towel. The Bundestag would be forced to elect a new chancellor to replace her, most likely from the CDU. Unless the governing parties agree to continue the coalition under a new leader, Germany’s ninth chancellor since World War II would serve in a caretaker capacity through to a new election.Split on the rightThe CDU and the CSU ar","A dispute has arisen within Angela Merkel’s coalition regarding migration policy, which has now escalated into one of the biggest tests of her chancellorship. The conflict has opened a rift between Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union and its CSU Bavarian sister party, which will ultimately determine the fate of the German leader. Horst Seehofer, Merkel’s interior minister and the leader of Bavaria’s Christian Social Union, is aiming to enforce a plan to send back migrants who have already registered for asylum in other European Union states. However, Merkel has rejected this proposal, stating that it would offload the burden on neighbouring states and ultimately impede any effort to establish a bloc-wide response to Europe’s struggle with migration.

The standoff between the two parties is reminiscent of past tensions that have periodically occurred between Merkel and Seehofer since the refugee crisis of 2015-2016, however, this time there is no apparent solution. As the political world watches in anticipation, multiple potential scenarios have been identified: the parties could agree to a compromise, a face-saving deal may not be found, Merkel may face a vote of confidence, or she may resign as chancellor. The decision made by Merkel and her coalition will have significant consequences for the immediate future of German politics."
politifact14814,1,1,"According to CNN, the former police chief of a small New Jersey town said African-Americans had “no value” and were “like ISIS,” and said he wanted to put them before a firing squad, and now the racist has been arrested.The FBI has arrested Frank Nucera Jr., who was the chief of Bordentown Township Police Department. They allege Nuncera referred to African-Americans using several racial slurs and told his officers to position police dogs at high school basketball games to specifically intimidate African-Americans.Nucera abruptly retired in February after he learned his use of racially motivated force was under investigation. He was making $151,418.31 per year. Nucera draws an annual pension of $105,992.76 — $8,832.73 per month — according to public records.Sixty-year-old Nucera is facing a hate crime charge and a federal civil rights charge. FBI Special Agent Vernon Addison wrote in an affidavit that Nucera “has a significant history of making racist comments concerning African Americans, to whom he frequently referred to as ‘n*ggers'”. One of Nucera’s officers “made numerous recordings” of Nucera that “contained extremely offensive racist comments” over the course of a year because he was “alarmed” by Nucera’s racism, according to the affidavit.The federal charges against Nucera relate to a Sept. 1, 2016, police encounter involving an 18-year-old African-American man and 16-year-old African-American girl. A hotel manager called police because he said the pair hadn’t paid for their hotel room the night before and were swimming in the hotel pool. The FBI affidavit states that their encounter with police “escalated into a physical struggle,” that both teens “resisted arrest” and that one of the officers used pepper spray.AdvertisementAfter both teens were handcuffed, Nucera grabbed the 18-year-old’s head and slammed it “into the right side of the metal doorjamb,” according to the affidavit. An officer heard the 18-year-old’s head make “a loud thud” as it hit the doorjamb, the feds alleged. Officers said the 18-year-old wasn’t resisting when Nucera slammed his head, but had “stopped walking for a moment to loudly complain.” The use of force wasn’t reported to the department.Hours after the assault, Nucera was recorded telling an officer he was “f*cking tired” of African-Americans.“I’ll tell you what, it’s gonna get to the point where I could shoot one of these motherfuckers,” Nucera allegedly said. “And that n*ggerr bitch lady, she almost got it,” he said, referring to the 16-year-old girl’s aunt, who was present at the arrest. “Fucking nipple hanging bitch. I’m so tired of them, man.”Nucera allegedly said that black people should “stay the fuck out of Bordentown” and referred to the 18-year-old as “fucking little, fucking n****r.”In a separate incident noted in the report that occurred in November 2015, Nucera said he wished an African-American from Trenton who he believed had slashed the tires of a police vehicle would give him a reason to “put my hands” on him.“These n****rs are like ISIS, they have no value,” Nucera allegedly said. “They should line them all up and mow ’em down. I’d like to be on the firing squad, I could do it. I used to think about if I could shoot someone or not, I could do it, I’m tired of it.”“The conduct alleged is shocking,” acting US Attorney William E. Fitzpatrick said at a news conference.“It’s a shocking breach of the duty of every police officer to provide equal justice under the law and to never mistreat a person in their custody.”AdvertisementNucera appeared in court Wednesday afternoon in Camden, NJ, and waived his right to a preliminary hearing. He was released on a bail of $500,000.","Former police chief of Bordentown Township Police Department, Frank Nucera Jr., has been arrested by the FBI on charges of hate crimes and federal civil rights violation.

Liberals were too quick to disperse this shocking picture, as proof of President Donald Trump’s cruelty. But their incredible blunder just backfired. Now, they’re screwed.The answer, naturally, is a resounding no. Democrats will do anything to undermine the president’s work. That includes being underhanded, manipulative, and cruel as possible.Within the course of Trump’s period in office, we have seen liberals do some shockingly dreadful things. They’ve insulted his wife by criticizing her intelligence, state of origin, as well as her accent, demonstrating who the real racists and sexists are.Liberals didn’t hesitate to question his children’s psychological health, even calling Barron handicapped. That is not even mentioning the numerous times that left handed outlets edited videos or photos to create Trump look like a poor guy.However, what they did that this weekend actually takes the cake. A photo went viral throughout Twitter. The dreadful picture depicted arrested illegal immigrants. These individuals — arrested by our government — were made to stay in cages resembling dog kennels.It is too bad that these liberals did not bother to check the date on the film.Ex-Obama staffer Jon Favreau, in a now-deleted conversation, linked to a AZCentral.com article titled,”First glance of immigrant kids at holding facility” and said”This is occurring right now, and the only argument that issue is the way we force our government to get these kids back to their families as quickly as possible”His obvious intent was to slam the Trump government for its treatment of unaccompanied minors taken into custody at the border. [Source: Twitchy]Jon Favreau was among many liberals who assaulted Trump within this injustice. The famous Hollywood actor and director once worked for Obama as his speechwriter. So I guess he understood how better things were under the last government, right? This liberal celebrity is likely horrified every day over what he sees coming from the White House. I mean, that could let something as bad as this:How dreadful! Certainly the guy responsible for this is a total racist, who hates brown people. Liberals have every right to spread this photograph to as many people as possible.But wait, let’s look at the initial post. It was from ACCentral.com. As stated by the date, this was composed in 2014.That’s right, liberals. This photograph you are so outraged more than was taken through Obama’s administration.Liberals were not storming Twitter with demands for change. They were not calling Obama racist for treating kids like this. Why weren’t the overlords inside the mainstream press requiring answers from his government?Appears like liberals didn’t care when Obama mistreated illegals. Yet they accuse Trump of racism, dependent on nothing. All Trump wants to do is protect our border from crime and terrorism.He is not treating illegals like creatures. However, while Trump calls vile MS-13 members”animals,” Obama was treating children like creatures. Really makes you think.Liberals, in their own feverish hatred for Trump, unwittingly outed among Obama’s numerous sins. And their own. They pretend to care, as a response to Trump’s stance on immigration.Before Trump suggested the wall, liberals did not think twice about illegals. We all know that for a fact since this article has been around for FOUR decades, and they have said nothing.Featured Image Source H/T: MadWorldNewsLike this: Like Loading...","Photos of arrested illegal immigrants being held in cage-like cells have recently gone viral on social media. Some liberals were quick to jump on these images, using them as proof of President Donald Trump’s perceived cruelty towards illegal immigrants. However, their outrage has backfired as it has been revealed that the photos are not recent but date back to 2014 when Barack Obama was President. 

While Democrats will do anything to undermine Trump’s work, their actions in disseminating these images have only exposed their hypocrisy. In the past, they have insulted Melania Trump, criticized Trump’s children’s mental health and edited videos to portray the President in a negative light. 

But the recent media frenzy over these cage-like cells has brought to light the fact that liberals did not care when Obama was treating children like animals, nor did they ever demand answers from his government. This highlights how their outrage towards Trump is merely a reaction to his stance on immigration. Trump’s main priority is to protect the border from crime and terrorism; he is not treating illegal immigrants like animals. While Trump has referred to MS-13 members as “animals,” Democrats have remained silent on the issue, preferring to criticize his every move. 

In conclusion, the recent outrage over photos of arrested illegal immigrants in cage-like cells demonstrates the hypocrisy of liberal Democrats. By exposing Obama’s poorly-handled immigration policies, they have inadvertently proven that their outrage towards Trump is merely a political ploy."

Shoemaker had held discussions with the principal to understand the purpose of the walkout, but only received a response that it was meant for ""students to express themselves"". It remains unclear if the walkout was a memorial for the Parkland victims or a show of support for gun control. The school district claims responsibility for students’ safety, necessitating supervision, but Shoemaker’s father insists that neutrality was his son’s sole motivation and that politics have no place in schools, adding that his family have subsequently received death threats and abuse."
politifact15210,1,1,"320 SHARES Share TweetPresident Trump is about to end the longstanding abuse of the American welfare system and ban migrants from getting free money and handouts for five years. The immigration rules will prohibit migrants from coming to the country and taking advantage of free American welfare money right away. It will slow down, or stop, chain migration while protecting American workers and potentially saving taxpayers money.What used to happen is that people would migrate to America and just live on the free money they received. That’s called welfare abuse. America is open to migrants, but perhaps we don’t want migrants who can’t fend for themselves. Maybe it’s better if people who are self-sufficient migrate to the country so that we can reduce the amount of citizens living off the system.President Trump wants to introduce a merit-based Green card system in which migrants compete for Visas. Migrants can earn points for themselves by learning to speak English, gaining job training or job offers, or doing something else that is considered a benefit to the America. The idea seems to be that in order for America to grant Visas or citizenship, the migrant has to give something back to the country. It’s as though the government wants to stop people coming to America and living off the system and would prefer people coming to the country to be contributors. Do something for America and America will do something for you.Migrants to those countries must compete for a limited number of visas by gaining points for English proficiency, competitive training, a job offer or another major achievement that benefits the host country.The concept, which is modeled after similar programs from Australia and Canada, is taking harsh criticism from activists. It’s like they want an open border policy where everyone gets free welfare money, but that would just be the downfall of America. If we observe what’s happening in Germany, with Merkel’s “come on in” policy, then we see a mass increase in horrible crimes like gang rape. Do we want mass amounts of migrant gang rape in America? There’s already enough trouble with crime in sanctuary cities that protect illegal immigrant criminals. Those folks should be deported because of their bad behavior and often violent crimes they commit on American people and even other immigrants.If America prevents immigrants from getting free benefits for five years, then that makes people think twice about coming here. If a family who thinks about crossing the border to start a new life knows that they cannot live for free, then they may not come at all. If they have possible jobs lined up and will be almost instantly integrating successfully with society, then that’s a great match. America is the land of the free, but not the land of the free money.Migrants who enter the United States cannot receive welfare during their first five years in the country, President Trump revealed from his upcoming immigration overhaul.“Just this week, we announced a historic immigration bill to create a merit-based Green Card system that ends the abuse of our welfare system, stops chain migration, and protects our workers and our economy,” he stated on his weekly radio address. “As an example, you cannot get welfare for five years when you come into our country.”“You cannot just come in like in past weeks, years, and decades, you come in immediately and start picking up welfare. For five years, you have to say you will not be asking or using our welfare systems.”Compare that to Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel opened the border to millions of unvetted migrants who can’t speak German and lack employable skills, which dooms them to perpetual welfare paid by German taxpayers – and boredom that manifests into terrorist attacks against, once again, German taxpayers.Last year the German government admitted that only 2.8% of over 1.2 million migrants had gotten a job – but even then those statistics might be exaggerated, according to j","President Trump has announced his intention to curtail the abuse of the American welfare system by banning migrants from receiving free money and handouts for five years. The new immigration rules will prohibit migrants from immediately taking advantage of welfare benefits upon arrival in the United States. This move aims to slow down or halt chain migration, while also protecting the American workforce and potentially reducing the burden on taxpayers.

Previously, migrants would migrate to the United States and rely solely on welfare benefits, which is considered as welfare abuse. While America remains open to migrants, the country may not necessarily want individuals who cannot support themselves. It might be more beneficial for self-sufficient individuals to migrate to America, reducing the number of citizens living off the system.

President Trump has proposed a merit-based Green card system for migrants vying for Visas. By participating in this system, migrants can earn points by learning English, receiving job training or offers, or engaging in other activities that benefit America. The aim seems to be a system in which individuals give back to the country in order to receive Visas or citizenship. This approach aims to prevent people from migrating to America and living off the system, instead encouraging people to be contributors.

This concept is similar to programs in Australia and Canada, albeit receiving harsh criticism from activists who advocate an open border policy, which could have devastating consequences for America. Recent examples of crime in Germany following Merkel's ""come on in"" policy demonstrate how unchecked migration can lead to catastrophic outcomes. The proposed system, however, could prevent further issues from arising, particularly in sanctuary cities with a high number of illegal immigrant criminals, who commit violence against American citizens and even other immigrants. These individuals should face deportation due to their bad behavior.

Preventing immigrants from obtaining financial benefits from the country for a defined period of time is likely to act as a deterrent. If a family is considering entering the country to start a new life, the knowledge that they will be unable to rely on welfare could discourage them from making the journey. If individuals have a job at their disposal and the ability to integrate successfully with society instantly, it would be a perfect match. America is the land of the free, although it is not a land of free money.

President Trump has made it clear that migrants who enter the United States will not be able to receive welfare for the first five years following their arrival, as per his immigration overhaul. The president's weekly radio address stated that the new merits-based Green Card system is designed to prevent abuse of the welfare system, curtail chain migration, and safeguard the American workforce and economy. As a result, migrants will no longer be able to receive welfare upon immediate entry to America and must pledge to avoid using welfare systems for a five-year period.

When comparing America to Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel opened the border to millions of unvetted migrants who struggle with language skills and lack employable qualifications, we see an approach doomed to perpetual welfare paid for by German taxpayers. Tragically, this often results in boredom manifesting itself in terrorist attacks against German taxpayers. Recent statistics reveal that only 2.8% of over 1.2 million migrants in Germany have obtained jobs. However, these statistics might be misleading, as suggested by some."

March For Our Lives required a permit from the police department of the city where the demonstration took place.

politifact14506,1,0,"A staggering 30,000 scientists have come forward confirming that man-made climate change is a hoax perpetuated by the elite in order to make money.One of the experts is weather channel founder, John Coleman, who warns that huge fortunes are being made by man-made climate change proponents such as Al Gore.Natural News reports:In a recent interview with Climate Depot, Coleman said:“Al Gore may emerge from the shadows to declare victory in the ‘global warming’ debate if Hillary Clinton moves into the White House. Yes, if that happens and the new climate regulations become the law of the land, they will be next to impossible to overturn for four to eight years.”Climate change proponents remain undeterred in their mission, ignoring numerous recent scientific findings indicating that there has been no warming trend at all for nearly two decades.Al Gore’s dire predictions of the melting of polar ice on a massive scale have proved to be completely false. In fact, in 2014 – a year that was touted as being “the hottest ever” in the Earth’s history – there were record amounts of ice reported in Antarctica, an increase in Arctic ice, and record snowfalls across the globe.Debunking the “97 percent” lieOn top of those “inconvenient truths,” the White House’s assertion that 97 percent of scientists agree that global warming is real has been completely debunked. Several independently-researched examinations of the literature used to support the “97 percent” statement found that the conclusions were cherry-picked and misleading.More objective surveys have revealed that there is a far greater diversity of opinion among scientists than the global warming crowd would like for you to believe.From the National Review:“A 2008 survey by two German scientists, Dennis Bray and Hans von Storch, found that a significant number of scientists were skeptical of the ability of existing global climate models to accurately predict global temperatures, precipitation, sea-level changes, or extreme weather events even over a decade; they were far more skeptical as the time horizon increased.”Other mainstream news sources besides the National Review have also been courageous enough to speak out against the global warming propaganda – even the Wall Street Journal published an op-ed piece in 2015 challenging the Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) pseudoscience being promulgated by global warming proponents.And, of course, there are the more than 31,000 American scientists (to date) who have signed a petition challenging the climate change narrative and 9,029 of them hold PhDs in their respective fields. But hey, Al Gore and his cronies have also ignored that inconvenient truth, as well.Many of those scientists who signed the petition were likely encouraged to speak out in favor of the truth after retired senior NASA atmospheric scientist John L. Casey revealed that solar cycles are largely responsible for warming periods on Earth – not human activity.Al Gore and cronies continue getting richer from the global warming hoaxBut the global warming crowd continues to push their agenda on the public while lining their pockets in the process. If you’re still inclined to believe what Al Gore has to say about global warming, please consider the fact that since he embarked on his crusade, his wealth has grown from $2 million in 2001 to $100 million in 2016 – largely due to investments in fake “green tech” companies and the effective embezzlement of numerous grants and loans.You might want to take all of this information into serious consideration before casting your vote in the November election.","It has been reported that a considerable number of scientists have come forward claiming that man-made climate change is a fabrication, created by the elite for financial gain. The renowned founder of the Weather Channel, John Coleman, is among these experts, warning that such proponents of climate change as Al Gore are currently making vast amounts of money from the spreading of this falsehood. However, campaigners continue their endeavors, without regard to multiple recent scientific discoveries, indicating no progressive warming trend for the past two decades. Gore's doomsday predictions regarding polar ice melts, hailed by many, have been proven to be completely unfounded. In addition, independent research has challenged the White House's claim that 97 percent of scientists support the notion of global warming. More objective surveys have revealed a far greater diversity of opinions among scientists regarding global warming.

The actor, the president, and climate scientist Dr. Katharine Hayhoe took the stage towards the end of the evening for a conversation on climate change before the U.S. premiere of DiCaprio’s new documentary on the subject, Before the Flood.The subject of Mars and SpaceX came up while Hayhoe was talking about the need to make people connect with the reality of climate change on a universal, human level. “The most important thing to do is not to pile up scientific reports until they reach a tottering pile of about 8 feet where they tip over and crush somebody,” Hayhoe said, explaining that what really matters when trying to motivate people to combat climate change thing is to connect its real meaning and impact to “what’s in our hearts.”“The reality of it is, if you’re a human living on this planet — which most of us are, yeah?” she joked. “As long as we haven’t signed up for the trip to Mars.

Maybe, just maybe, he figured the only place tougher than frozen uncharted western territories is the Martian surface. The Academy would love it.It’s probably method acting, is what we’re saying.Earlier in the night, Obama made a Star Trek reference while talking about the importance of flawed but useful energy sources like fracking and nuclear power. “Until we invent the perfect energy source — Lithium crystals or whatever, Scotty’s there beaming us up — but until then we need to live in the real world,” Obama said.","Acclaimed Hollywood actor, Leonardo DiCaprio, known for his enthralling performances in the film industry, has revealed his plans to journey to Mars.

Disturbingly, the fate of many of these children, mostly migrants, remains unknown.NY Mag reports: Local law enforcement uncovered the operation last year, prompting the Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations to open an inquiry into the federal government’s handling of migrants.“It is intolerable that human trafficking — modern-day slavery — could occur in our own backyard,” Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio and the chairman of the subcommittee, told the New York Times. “But what makes the Marion cases even more alarming is that a U.S. government agency was responsible for delivering some of the victims into the hands of their abusers.”As detention centers became incapable of housing the massive influx of migrants, the Department of Health and Human Services started placing children into the care of sponsors who would oversee the minors until their bids for refugee status could be reviewed. But in many cases, officials failed to confirm whether the adults volunteering for this task were actually relatives or good Samaritans — and not unscrupulous egg farmers or child molesters.The department performed check-in visits at caretakers’ homes in only 5 percent of cases between 2013 and 2015, according to the report.The Senate’s investigation built on an Associated Press report that found more than two dozen unaccompanied children were placed in homes where they were sexually abused, starved, or forced into slave labor.

Waters was charged with three counts of violating House rules and the federal ethics code.According to The Hill’s report from 2010:The House ethics committee on Monday outlined its charges against Rep. Maxine Waters, who is accused of helping a bank in which her husband owned stock secure federal bailout funds. The committee charged the 10-term California Democrat with three counts of violating House rules and the federal ethics code in connection with her effort to arrange a 2008 meeting between Treasury officials and representatives with OneUnited bank. The panel said Waters, who sits on the Financial Services Committee, broke a House rule requiring members to behave in a way that reflects “creditably” on the chamber. The committee said that by trying to assist OneUnited, she stood to benefit directly, because her husband owned a sizable amount of stock that would have been “worthless” if the bank failed. The committee also accused Waters of violating the “spirit” of a House rule prohibiting lawmakers from using their positions for financial gain, as well as a government ethics statute banning the dispensing of “special favors.”The charges were delayed and stalled by members of the committee, and multiple attorneys in the case were fired. Ultimately, Waters was absolved of the charges.According to National Review:[Waters] walked away with a slap on the wrist from the toothless House Ethics Committee in 2012 after being charged with multiple ethics violations related to her meddling in minority-owned OneUnited Bank … As stockholders, they profited handsomely from their relationship with the bank. It was a mutually beneficial relationship. After Waters’s office personally intervened and lobbied the Treasury Department in 2008, OneUnited received $12 million in federal TARP bailout money — despite another government agency concluding that the bank operated “without effective underwriting standards” and engaged “in speculative investment practices. After the federal bailout of Fannie/Freddie, OneUnited’s stock in the government-sponsored enterprises plunged to a value estimated at less than $5 million. Only through Waters’s intervention was OneUnited able to secure an emergency meeting with the Treasury and then-Secretary Henry Paulson. Tom Fitton, Judicial Watch president, reported that Waters’s friend and fellow California Democratic congresswoman Zoe Lofgren helped delay Waters’s scheduled 2010 House ethics trial on the matter by stalling subpoenas and improperly firing two attorneys working on the investigation. Six of ten House Ethics panel members quit the case in 2012 over questions about their partiality. An outside investigator absolved Waters of any wrongdoing. In spite of getting off on the charges, Waters carries with her a terrible reputation for corruption. Please see this list for a rundown of all the numerous scandals and charges which have been brought against her. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington has listed her as one of the most corrupt members of Congress five times. Resist.","In recent years, Congresswoman Maxine Waters has emerged as a prominent figure among the Trump ""Resistance"", advocating for the impeachment of the President. However, her history as a government official came under legal scrutiny back in 2010. Waters, who served as a 10-term California Democrat, was charged with three counts of violating House rules and the federal ethics code. 

According to a report by The Hill in 2010, the House ethics committee charged Waters with assisting OneUnited bank, in which her husband owned stock, to secure federal bailout funds. The committee accused Waters of violating House rules that require members to act in a manner that reflects “creditably” on the chamber. Additionally, she was accused of violating a House rule that prohibits lawmakers from using their positions for financial gains and a government ethics statute that forbids the dispensing of “special favors”.

The case was mired by delays and disputes, and lawyers working on it were fired. Eventually, Waters was cleared of the charges. National Review reported that Waters was charged with multiple ethics violations related to her intervention in OneUnited Bank, in which she and her husband were stockholders.  Waters, through her office, lobbied the Treasury Department in 2008, after which OneUnited received $12 million in federal bailout under the TARP program. Despite another government agency’s warning that the bank operated “without effective underwriting standards” and engaged in “speculative investment practices”, OneUnited was able to secure the bailout money with Waters’ intervention. 

According to reports, six out of the ten House Ethics panel members quit the case after concerns were raised about their partiality. Waters was cleared of any wrongdoing by an outside investigator. Despite being absolved of the charges, Waters has been listed as one of the most corrupt members of Congress by Citizen for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington on five separate occasions.

While Waters has been fervently advocating for Trump’s impeachment, her past has been brought into question. Her alleged involvement with OneUnited Bank and its bailout, in which she and her husband stood to benefit, brings attention to the ethical standards of those holding public office. It is a reminder that our representatives should act in the interest of the public and not use their positions for financial gains."

Rosalynn Carter underwent surgery to remove a benign lump from her breast in April 1977. Weeks after Betty Ford became first lady, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a mastectomy in September 1974.The first lady did not move to Washington until six months into the administration, choosing to let their son, Barron, finish the 2017 school year in New York. More recently, Melania Trump has had a more public profile. On April 24, she and the President hosted the first official state dinner of the Trump administration, an event that was planned and executed primarily by the first lady.Trump was responsible for every aspect of the formal dinner in honor of French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte Macron, from the hand-selected ivory tablecloths to the menu, which the first lady designed to meld American food with French influence. During the welcome ceremony leading up to the dinner, Melania Trump stole headlines, wearing a crisp white Michael Kors Collection suit with a matching white hat, custom-made by her personal couturier. The hat set the internet ablaze, with references and comparisons to Beyoncé, the suffragette movement and even television character Olivia Pope of ""Scandal.""On May 7, Trump, a relatively private first lady by comparison to her most recent predecessors, was once again front and center, this time to unveil her formal platform, Be Best .

The latter caused a firestorm of controversy because it encompasses cyberbullying, a tactic that Melania Trump's husband, the President, has often been accused of fueling.

politifact14840,1,0,"The FDA has published conclusive proof on their website that the DTap vaccine can cause autism.According to the FDA’s online Biologics Blood Vaccines document, a vaccine manufacturer admits on its package insert that their vaccination can cause autism as one of many adverse reactions.These adverse events reported during post-approval use of Tripedia vaccine include idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, SIDS, anaphylactic reaction, cellulitis, autism, convulsion/grand mal convulsion, encephalopathy, hypotonia, neuropathy, somnolence and apnea. Events were included in this list because of the seriousness or frequency of reporting. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequencies or to establish a causal relationship to components of Tripedia vaccine.In this sense, it should be noted that:Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Concentrates (For Further Manufacturing Use) are produced by The Research Foundation for Microbial Diseases of Osaka University (BIKEN), Osaka, Japan, under United States (US) license, and are combined with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur Inc. Tripedia vaccine is filled, labeled, packaged, and released by Sanofi Pasteur Inc.What’s in Tripedia that probably can interfere with brain chemistry and neurology?According to the Tripedia’s package insert, some ingredients include: Bovine extract, formaldehyde used to inactivate microorganisms a couple of times, ammonium sulfate, aluminum potassium sulfate and two growth mediums: modified Mueller and Miller is one; the other is Stainer-Scholte medium.What is the content of these two growth mediums?Mueller and Miller medium, contains:Glucose, sodium chloride, sodium phosphate dibasic, monopotassium, phosphate, magnesium sulfate hydrate, ferrous sulfate heptahydrate, cysteine hydrochloride, tyrosine hydrochloride, uracil hydrochloride, Ca-pantothenate in ethanol, thiamine in ethanol, pyridoxine-hydrochloride in ethanol, riboflavin in ethanol, biotin in ethanol, sodium hydroxide, beef heart infusion (de- fatted beef heart and distilled water), casein [milk protein] solution. Basically a mixture of sugar, salt, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals.While Stainer-Scholte medium has the following ingredients:Tris hydrochloride, tris base, glutamate (monosodium salt) [MSG], proline, salt, monopotassium phosphate, potassium chloride, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, ferrous sulfate, ascorbic acid, niacin, glutathione.The vaccine is formulated without preservatives, but contains a trace amount of thimerosal [(mercury derivative), (≤0.3 μg mercury/dose)] from the manufacturing process. Each 0.5 mL dose also contains, by assay, not more than 0.170 mg of aluminum and not more than 100 μg(0.02%) of residual formaldehyde. The vaccine contains gelatin and polysorbate 80 (Tween-80), which are used in the production of the pertussis concentrate.“Probable cause” ingredients for adverse reactions include: casein, to which some children are allergic; MSG—an excitotoxin; thimerosal-ethyl mercury; aluminum; formaldehyde; gelatin; and polysorbate 80.You might be wondering:Why some of the doctors don’t say anything about the risk of DTaP Vaccine?That is a question that many of us, still wondering! Maybe they just is just not convenient for them that we know about the risk of these vaccine.To take the vaccine debacle further, most of the mandated vaccines for infants and children, contain many of the above ingredients, which must be stopped from being injected into infants, toddlers, teens and even adults!It’s time for Congress to rescind the “Get out of Jail Free” card for vaccine makers and stop the aggressive onslaught of the Autism Spectrum Disorder that is depriving children of a fulfilling life and ruining families emotionally, financially, and physically to the point of parents divorcing because of the stresses of ASD in a family.It’s about time vaccines are publicl","The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has officially released information on their website stating that the vaccine for Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis (DTap) has been linked to the development of Autism Spectrum Disorder. According to a document on the FDA’s website, a vaccine manufacturer openly confesses that their product can lead to autism as among numerous other unfavorable reactions.

Reports on adverse events resulting from post-approval utilization of the Tripedia vaccine such as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), Cellulitis, Anaphylactic Reaction, Hypotonia, Encephalopathy, Convulsion/Grand Mal Convulsion, Apnea, Neuropathy, Somnolence, and Autism are all listed as a part of the FDA's Biologics Blood Vaccines documentation. The reason behind their inclusion is either due to their seriousness or frequency of reporting. However, voluntary reporting by persons from a population of uncertain size, it's not easy to accurately set the frequencies or prove a causal connection between the ingredients that compose the Tripedia vaccine.

Also included in the text is a statement indicating that the Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Concentrates used by The Research Foundation for Microbial Diseases of Osaka University (BIKEN), Osaka, Japan, in the vaccine's production, holds a US license and is combined with tetanus and diphtheria toxoids prepared by Sanofi Pasteur Inc. Tripedia vaccine is therefore created by Sanofi Pasteur Inc. and is filled, labelled, packaged then released.

The Tripedia vaccine contains the following ingredients as stated on its package insert: glucose, salt, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals found in Mueller and Miller medium as well as tris hydrochloride, tris base, glutamate, salt, monopotassium phosphate, magnesium chloride, ferrous sulfate, calcium chloride, niacin, glutathione, proline, and ascorbic acid for the Stainer-Scholte medium. Other components include bovine extract, formaldehyde, ammonium sulfate, aluminum potassium sulfate, gelatin, and polysorbate 80.

The package insert contains a warning that the vaccine may cause adverse reactions in some children; these reactions include MSG's excitotoxin effects, allergic reactions due to casein allergenicity, mercury derivative's thimerosal content, aluminum, formaldehyde, gelatin, and polysorbate 80.

Despite these documented risks, many doctors continue to advocate for the use of DTaP vaccines in children while ignoring the negative consequences. A change is needed to stop the use of vaccines with multiple risky elements in infants, toddlers, teens, and adults. It is time for Congress to repeal the “Get out of Jail Free” card for vaccine producers and the aggressive spread of ASD, which is emotionally, financially, and physically exhausting families to the point of separation and ruin. Therefore, utmost priority should be given to making vaccines open to the public."
politifact13559,1,1,"Mike Pence said he didn’t understand why Michelle Obama had so passionately condemned his running mate, Donald Trump, for boasting about forcibly grabbing women by their genitals. The First Lady denounced the Republican presidential nominee, although she never dismissively spoke his name, for “speaking freely and openly about sexually predatory behavior” – which she said had “shaken (her) to the core.”“First and foremost,” Pence argued, “I have no idea why Mrs. Obama, who will be departing the White House shortly, is even commenting on the future President of the United States, God-willing. That’s the first thing I don’t quite get. Secondly, if she’s the First Lady, shouldn’t she be focused on doing whatever it is that First Ladies are supposed to be doing as their duties while their husbands are rescuing the world? What’s she doing commenting on and obviously worrying about her successor? That’s not what she should be doing.”The governor of Indiana also said that she “has no business” commenting on men and their “restroom talk,” as well as that that’s not “ladylike behavior.” “Now, I know that the word ‘lady’ is kind of in her job description, but it looks to me she’s not behaving like one, at least as of late,” he said. “If she was a real lady, she wouldn’t be commenting on men’s restroom talk and neglecting her own work and duties just so she could get a word out on a topic that she finds interesting for some reason.”He continued, “If we had anyone else serving as the first lady, they would pretend like they hadn’t heard it and would be going about their business in a normal fashion. But no, Michelle Obama is so vulgar she’s not only being vocal about it, but she’s also convinced that her job title will add weight and significance to her words. And she may be fooling those who can’t see through her smoke screen, but the rest of us have her figured out. She can’t fool me, just like she can’t fool Donald Trump or any other conservative American who has the guts to think for himself.”“How many times do I have to repeat the fact that what he did and the language he used was just restroom talk?” Pence asked. “He has apologized for it several times, and I really don’t know what else people want him to do. And now you have countless media outlets spearheaded by the New York Times who are calling Donald a sexual predator. And as if that wasn’t enough, the first lady also thinks she’s ordinary enough to be commenting on the issue as well. That’s just ridiculous.”“There is no way in hell Michelle Obama isn’t working with the New York Times in a joint effort to smear the good name of Donald Trump, if you ask me. I refuse to believe all of these women who are popping up out of nowhere with stories that Donald Trump had sexually assaulted them are a random occurrence. This is too well organized to be an accident. And the entire Democratic Party is behind it, with the addition of their latest recruit, the soon-to-be ex-first lady Michelle Obama. And I’m actually glad that’s the case because when Donald wins, we’ll offer all of them a job just for the fun of it,” Pence concluded.","Mike Pence has stated that he does not fully comprehend why Michelle Obama is so critical of his running mate, Donald Trump, for bragging about forcibly grabbing women by their private parts. Mrs. Obama expressed her disappointment in the Republican presidential candidate, though she did not mention him by name, for being “casual and cavalier in talking about sexually abusive behavior” – which she claims had a traumatic effect on her soul.  The governor of Indiana suggested that he isn’t aware of why Mrs. Obama, who will shortly vacate her White House post, is even concerning herself with the future leader of the free world. Mr. Pence added that the First Lady should instead be focusing on her official duties as her spouse is ""saving the universe.""  He further asserts that she has “no business” commenting on “restroom talk” between males since she is not behaving like a ""lady."" 

Mike Pence stressed that what Donald Trump said was simply ""locker room banter,"" and he has already apologized for the incident several times. He is at a loss as to what further measures anyone could want him to take. However, the New York Times and other media firms have labeled Donald Trump a ""sexual predator"" based on allegations from many women who claim he assaulted them. Pence believes that Michelle Obama is joining hands with these media outlets, and the Democratic Party in an attempt to adversely affect Trump's reputation. In fact, he alludes to them working in tandem to discredit the good name of Trump.

Pence's unwavering allegiance towards Donald Trump is resolute. His accusations against Michelle Obama and the press suggest that he wants his readers to wholeheartedly support him and his running mate."
politifact14742,1,0,"Giant Squid Washes Ashore on Lake Michigan Michigan DNR were called to Leland to the report of a giant squid which had washed ashore. Michigan DNR Marine Biologist Dr. Debra Polowotski arrived at Good Harbor Bay and confirmed the 21 foot-long giant squid to be a very rare fresh-water species of genus Architeuthis. “We thought they were already in Lake Erie, we had no idea they were in Lake Michigan. This is first time there’s been an actual specimen recovered, so this is very exciting”, she said. It is believed that a few of the squid escaped from the Cleveland Sea World complex during the great Northeast blackout of 2003 when they were very young, and somehow made it into Lake Erie. According to Dr. Polowotski, the squid were kept contained in Lake Erie, as the Detroit River is too narrow and shallow for the squid to swim upstream. “They are intimidated by closed-in spaces. They need a lot of room. You have to remember that this is a very big animal”, she said. Dr. Polotwotski also confirmed that the squid is a female and further examination of the corpse indicated that it had recently laid eggs. “Hopefully the walleye can keep the tiny-giant squid population under control, else there is some cause for concern”, said Dr. Polowotski. “Boaters and swimmers really need to exercise some caution”. The animal was discovered by Bob Ritchie and his sister Jill, both of Romeo. “We were just, you know, taking an evening walk along the beach, heading out to the sandbar when we stumbled across it”, said Bob. “We were singing, drinking whiskey out of the bottle, not thinking about tomorrow. But something like this really does make you stop and think”, he said. DNR officials removed the animal from the beach and took it to an undisclosed location for further study.","Michigan DNR responded to reports of an unusual sight at Good Harbor Bay in Leland: a giant squid had washed ashore. Upon examination, Marine Biologist Dr. Debra Polowotski confirmed that the specimen was a rare fresh-water species of genus Architeuthis, measuring 21 feet in length. This discovery proves to be extremely significant, as it is the first documented instance of the species in Lake Michigan. 

It appears that the squid may have originated from Cleveland Sea World, where a few young squid managed to escape during a great Northeast blackout in 2003 and entered Lake Erie. However, Dr. Polowotski assures the public that the squid remained within Lake Erie, unable to navigate the shallow and narrow Detroit River. “These creatures require an expansive and open habitat”, she explains. 

The examination of the squid’s body revealed that it was female and had recently laid eggs. Dr. Polowotski advises caution to boaters and swimmers, as this news may have implications for the lake’s ecosystem. “It is hoped that the local walleye population will maintain control over any further squid offspring”, she states. 

The specimen was discovered by Bob Ritchie and his sister Jill of Romeo during an evening stroll along the beach. DNR officials have removed the giant squid from the beach and relocated it to an undisclosed location for further study."

This fake dossier was then passed to James Comey at the FBI, who then issued FISA warrants to surveillance Donald Trump at the Trump Tower prior to the election, which later sparked Robert Mueller’s Special Counsel to investigate any Russian collusion in the 2016 Presidential Election. This, in a nutshell, exposes the spying and the treason that the DNC committed under the Obama administration to try to prevent Trump from succeeding, which is all stated in the Nunes Memo.Denzel affirmed, “If the Democrats had won the election, we never would have found out they were using false documents to get warrants to spy on American citizens and political opponents. We never would have known this. Think about it!”Denzel Washington, who has been nominated for Best Actor for the film ‘Roman J.

Reports indicate that the DNC administered the Clinton Foundation to fund a fake dossier, masterminded by Christopher Steele and Fusion GPS, in an attempt to establish false allegations capable of conceding Donald Trump's Presidential victory. James Comey later obtained the dossier and issued FISA warrants to surveil Donald Trump and his associates in Trump Tower, while the Robert Mueller Special Counsel was launched to investigate any Russian collusion in the 2016 Presidential Election.

There have, however, been concerns that this episode reveals nothing but acts of spying and treason on the part of the DNC under the Obama regime. Denzel Washington himself has raised a vital point of concern stating that if the Democrats had actually won the election, the use of fake documents to obtain warrants for spying on American citizens and political opponents would have remained undiscovered. Furthermore, he suggested that the current situation presents nothing but an opportunity for the Democrats to use the same tactics in the future to circumvent the will of the people in subsequent elections.

Reports have also revealed that the warrant to probe the Trump team was based on media reports that in turn used information provided by an opposition research firm that was being paid by the DNC and Hillary Clinton. It is reasonable to question the ethical implications of this action, particularly in the absence of media scrutiny, which could have blown the whistle on the conspiracies of the DNC. It is noteworthy that media outlets are complicit in covering up the scandals of the Democratic Party.

Denzel Washington's claims are as pertinent as they are timely, given that they reflect the apparent double standards that exist in relation to this issue. A celebrity figure like Denzel Washington who is high up in leadership circles agrees that the issue has been downplayed by mainstream media, when it should have been treated with more importance and gravity, given its treasonous nature."

They further ask for the release of classified NASA information concerning the American moon landings that would prove to the world that the moon landings were not an elaborate ruse meant to deceive the world about America’s space program capabilities.

Recent analysis of pictures taken from the Chinese moon rover allegedly reveals that there are no traces of the American moon landings on the moon.

After that, it spread fast. Mashable, The New York Post, The Daily Mail, Esquire, and Variety have all published a story, and pretty much all of these articles are based on one or two tweets from @solikerose. Plus, many of the original stories didn’t include statements from CNN or RCN, the cable company that supposedly aired the porn.Fact-checking largely didn’t begin until the stories were published.

There is only so much we can downsize by moving to a tiny home, so planning for storage space is an integral part of preparation for tiny living.VerticalityTiny houses for sale in Florida have tiny floor plans. There is only so much space to put things on the floor, and once bare necessities such as beds, kitchen elements etc. are taken care of, there is little space left to put all of our stuff. Verticality is key in these situations. Wall-mounted shelving is excellent for organizing your stuff and it doesn’t demand a single inch of your floor. They are also quite inexpensive and easy to install. Instead of having an entertainment center, it is now easy to mount your TV and speakers on the wall, leaving more space for things you can’t compromise with.Multi-functional FurnitureIn a tiny house, a bed doesn’t have the luxury to be just a bed. It needs to perform multiple functions, where storage is one of the most important ones. The same applies to coffee and night tables, sofas and kitchen elements. Beds can have drawers for your linens, or room for storage under their mattress. Instead of a regular coffee table, opt in for a cube design, where multiple storage drawers are integrated for all those small things you don’t have space for.Customized FurnitureSometimes it is difficult to furnish a tiny home, especially if it doesn’t use a standard floor plan. Customized furniture is a huge advantage in tiny homes, where space is at a premium. You can make sure that every single corner and nook of your house can be used in a functional way. The same applies to storage. A well-placed shelf or locker, can perform a very important function while not taking up much space or by utilizing and otherwise unused space.

Tiny living is about downsizing your living space to bare necessities but that has a different meaning for different people. In order to create more space for storing stuff you can’t live without, making some sacrifices when it comes to appliances is important. Instead of a full-sized stove, opt in for a dual heat-plate design that will take up less space. A small refrigerator works fine, just like a large two-door model. Also shopping more frequently for fresh groceries will lead you to a healthier lifestyle and diet. A fold out dinning-table in the kitchen, saves you the space that you might need for a dining table. Tiny appliances and gadgets do tend to have a higher price than standard ones, but they provide so much more than function to tiny home dwellers.","Living in a spacious home provides us with a sense of abundance that frees us from worrying about storage space. However, for those opting to live in tiny homes, storage space becomes a critical concern that must be factored in during the planning phase of building, buying, or furnishing their living quarters. Though it is not always feasible to downsize beyond a certain point, careful planning for storage space is essential to make tiny living a comfortable and functional reality. 

Verticality is crucial in tiny homes, especially since their floor plans are substantially smaller. Since there is limited space to put things on the floor, wall-mounted shelving can help maximize storage space without taking up any additional floor area. Additionally, such shelving solutions are budget-friendly and easy to install. If you opt for wall-mounting your television and speakers, you will free up additional space for other essential items that may be of greater priority. 

Multi-functional furniture is a must-have in tiny homes. Beds, coffee, and night tables, kitchen elements, and sofas need to serve multiple purposes, one of which is storage. Drawers can be installed beneath beds to support linen storage. Similarly, cube-design coffee tables can be used instead of regular ones, for they contain multiple drawers for storing your belongings. 

Customizable furniture is another excellent solution for tiny homes. Furnishing a tiny home can be challenging and requires ingenuity when it comes to space utilization. Custom-made furniture helps to optimize every corner and nook of your home. It can come in handy when it comes to storage, for a well-placed locker or shelf can efficiently fulfill key functions without taking up too much space. While custom-made furniture does come at a price, it is a worthwhile investment that will simplify your life in a tiny home. 

The size of furniture and appliances that fit into a tiny home is limited. Using tiny appliances is essential to maximizing available space for storage and other functional requirements. While a full-sized stove may not be practical, a dual heat-plate design is more appropriate. Similarly, a small refrigerator or a two-door model is preferable to a large one. Finally, shopping frequently for fresh groceries can lead you to embrace a healthy lifestyle and diet. Incorporating a fold-out dining table rather than a regular one can also save valuable space in the kitchen. Though tiny appliances tend to be pricier than their standard-sized counterparts, they provide benefits that outweigh their cost."

The Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner has confirmed that 60 people died in February from the same alarming cause, which brings the total deaths from this to 109 this year for just this one small part of Ohio. However, the issue is widespread across the country and only getting worse, which is why Donald Trump wants to do something about it now.Fatal drug overdoses now surpass car deaths in America thanks to the increased use, availability, and abuse of heroin, fentanyl or a combination of the two that come into the country from wide open borders and unchecked immigrants. With each month comes a new record number of deaths from this drug not just in Ohio, but nationwide.“February’s number could increase because seven cases are still awaiting further toxicology testing. Of the fatalities last month, 36 were Cleveland residents,” Fox 8 reported. Trump is well aware of the opioid epidemic that claimed 52,000 lives in 2015, which was the most amount of overdoses in a single year in U.S. History. This is part of the reason he’s wanting to crack down so hard on the border.During his joint address to Congress on Tuesday, the President said that he will build “a great, great wall along our southern border” — in part to dramatically slow the flow of narcotics pouring into the U.S. at an “unprecedented rate.” “Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately stop,” Trump promised in his speech, Vox reported. Although a wall won’t stop it completely, he’s the first to address the epidemic that’s gotten worse while it was ignored the last eight years.While Trump was criticized for his comment that the wall would stop the flow of drugs, it’s a step in the right direction and he’s at least ready to do something about it, whereas his predecessor was not.

Griffin snapped at him by asking how he sleeps at night. Gidley replied that he sleeps well and said thanks. Then it seems like she said something else, and he asked if they were going to go at it right there on the spot, and that’s when Griffin went into the full nasty mode and talked with a repulsive next few words that had people questioning her behavior and gender at the same time.Here’s what happened in full detail courtesy of the Washington Blade: “The event is a celebration of the First Amendment. As a longtime LGBT rights advocate, a comedian and provocateur, Griffin has made a long and successful career out of exercising her First Amendment right to free speech. The stunt last year in which she posed with a mock severed head of Donald Trump — which needlessly led CNN to fire her from a longstanding New Year’s Eve hosting gig with Anderson Cooper — was a textbook case of satire, which is constitutionally protected speech.Thus, the decision to invite Griffin proved an easy and obvious one. (We also invited Stormy Daniels, but her attorney, Michael Avenatti, told me without irony that it would be too much of a “sideshow” for her to attend.)Trending: Sarah Sanders Just Revealed What She Asked God For After Being Publicly Humiliated At WH DinnerGriffin didn’t disappoint, bringing her quick wit and fearless, LGBT-centric sense of humor to the dinner table. I met her and her boyfriend, Randy Bick, on the red carpet and held her purse as she posed for photographers and granted a series of TV interviews. Inside the heavy purse was a stapler; it turns out she suffered a last-minute wardrobe malfunction leaving the hotel, breaking a strap on her gown. After it was repaired, she feared a repeat and asked to borrow the stapler, just in case.She proved a good sport throughout the night, posing for an endless stream of selfies with (mostly gay) fans who congratulated her on surviving the Trump machine’s attacks in the aftermath of the photo scandal. When asked how her famous mom Maggie is at age 96, Griffin replied, “drunk.”The only awkward moment came when Deputy White House Press Secretary Hogan Gidley tried to squeeze past our table. Griffin stopped him and said, “How do you sleep at night?” Gidley replied, “Very well, thank you.” When Griffin expressed doubt about that, Gidley asked, “Are we really going to do this?”That’s when things got interesting. Griffin, in her trademark style, retorted, “Yes we are, suck my d-ck! No, really, suck my d-ck!”There was some back-and-forth, then Gidley, who was holding a Tecate, announced he was off to enjoy his Mexican beer “before we build the wall and you can’t get these anymore.” That prompted a farewell “f-ck you” from Griffin, triggering nervous laughter around our table.”It sure sounds like they had a fun time exchanging comments before Kathy Griffin took it to the levels of a unprofessionalism, acting exactly like the person who couldn’t hold a job with the Squatty Potty.Even though she claims to be a comedian, there’s still a level of professionalism that people should exude when they’re not on stage. Griffin has been unable to differentiate that and consistently confuses real life for her stage life (or lack thereof).Griffin might have some fans, but she","continues to alienate and offend a significant portion of the public with her inappropriate and classless behavior. At a recent event celebrating the First Amendment, Griffin made repulsive comments to Deputy White House Press Secretary Hogan Gidley, prompting many to question her behavior and gender identity. Despite her claims of being a comedian, her lack of professionalism both on and off stage has hindered her success compared to others in her field. While exercising free speech is encouraged, it is important to maintain a level of respect and decency when interacting with others in professional settings. Griffin's behavior at the event is not indicative of a successful career and leaves much to be desired."
politifact14273,1,1,"There is not a day that goes by that we don’t hear about a Muslim terror attack taking place somewhere in our world, but that hasn’t stopped leftists from defending them at every opportunity. Those of us that criticize the so-called “religion of peace” are subjected to ridicule and even being attacked for our belief of how dangerous Muslims are. In Europe, those that speak out against Islam are being imprisoned for their belief. Courts are actually sentencing people for “Islam anti-blasphemy” laws. While this may be par for the course in Europe right now, it is not the way we roll in America, until now. Minnesota has just established a similar law.Anti-blasphemy laws are a huge victory for Muslims because it ensures their protection and in turn, allows them to continue acting in whatever manner they please all the while marching towards Sharia Law.According to Minneapolis’ local newspaper, the Star-Tribune, the hotline was set up as a way to target Trump supporters, who Muslims believe are the group of people most likely to “harass them.” The Star Tribune reported:The city of Minneapolis has set up a hotline for residents to report hate-crime incidents and other acts of intolerance.The service, operated through the city’s 311 helpline, is aimed to aid targets of any “harassing behaviors motivated by prejudice,” according to a city news release issued on Monday.The announcement comes amid signs of a recent surge of such incidents affecting Muslims and Jews across the country, many of which go unreported.“Since the general election, many of us have experienced, witnessed firsthand or heard of actions of: racism, xenophobia, sexism and bigotry directed at people here and in cities across the United States,” Minneapolis Department of Civil Rights Director Velma Korbel wrote in a statement posted on the city’s website. “In no uncertain terms, hate-motivated speech and actions have no place in Minneapolis nor will they be tolerated.”The city’s Department of Civil rights along with mayor is leading the charge for this government-enforced fascism, as this new hotline will now encourage citizens to turn in their neighbors for holding opinions deemed forbidden by the state. This hotline flies right in the face of our United States Constitution, where it goes to the heart of denying American citizens their inalienable rights of the First Amendment, which governments CAN NOT DO. Of course, the rabid liberals controlling the city have little regard for the Constitution or the rights of Americans, as they are using their position to establish a soft version of anti-blasphemy laws. “In no uncertain terms, hate-motivated speech and actions have no place in Minneapolis nor will they be tolerated,” Minneapolis Department of Civil Rights Director Velma Korbel wrote in a statement posted on the city’s website.The Department echoes the unconstitutional sentiments of Minneapolis’ mayor, Betsy Hodges, who went on to blast President Trump, pushing her insane narrative of there being an epidemic of bigotry and hate in our country since he got into office. She stated: “I will not compromise the public safety of the people of Minneapolis to satisfy Trump’s desire to put politics before public safety. Minneapolis is being built and strengthened by people from all over the world and I am grateful for their commitment to our city. I stand with them today and will continue to take that stand as the President-elect prepares to take office.” The idea of an anti-blasphemy hotline in America is pretty absurd, but right up liberal’s alley. Why are they so willing to protect those that would seek to hurt us, don’t they want to protect their loved ones? This is only the beginning of the Democrats plans to take control of our country again, but what they don’t realize is that everyone will end up suffering if we continue to bow to Muslim’s demands. This “anti-blasphemy” hotline is just the start and will only get worse if we allow it. It is very similar to Nazi Ger","The rise in global terrorist attacks connected to the Muslim religion has resulted in a divisive response from individuals across the political spectrum. While many defend the rights of Muslims to practice their religion without fear or persecution, others remain critical of what they consider to be a real danger posed by Islam. Recent reports suggest that even in the United States, some officials are taking steps to limit free speech in a bid to protect those who may be targeted by intolerance. This is particularly evident in the city of Minneapolis, which has established an anti-hate hotline designed to help residents counteract acts of intolerance and hateful behaviour directed at specific minority groups. While some fear that this hotline will only serve to restrict free speech and hurt those with minority opinions deemed 'forbidden,' others are grateful for the city's proactive stance in protecting its people. Ultimately, the debate around issues of free speech, religion, and the role of government in shaping social norms is an ongoing and complex one, and the Minneapolis hotline is likely to create further tension and discourse among citizens and politicians alike."
politifact15263,1,1,"Share Us.A 78-year old retired officer of the CIA, Normand Hodges, has made a series of astonishing confessions. He claims he committed 37 assassinations for the American government between 1959 and 1972, including the actress and model, Marilyn Monroe. Hodges says he has no regrets.In amongst his many confessions, he admits to being a group member of five CIA agents, whose sole task was to carry out assassinations. He also admits one of his assassinations being none other than Glamour icon, Marilyn Monroe, who was killed not just because of her ties with John F Kennedy, but also because she slept with Fidel Castro, ultimately making her a massive national security risk.Hodges says he has no regrets.He claims he carried out 37 assassinations for the US Government between 1959 and 1972 including Marilyn Monroe.Hodges had worked for the CIA.Hodges was a CIA officer for 41 years working as an operative amongst top level security clearances, he claims he was employed as a hit-man by the organization, his duty was to assassinate individuals who posed a threat to the security of the United States of America.He was trained as a sniper and a martial arts expert but also trained in other methods ranging from taking people out with poisons to using explosives.Despite his old age, Hodges has managed to recall each of the assassinations he committed for the CIA. He goes on to admit that the murders were carried out on American soil and by the orders of his then commanding officer, Major James “Jimmy” Hayworth.He also claims the timeline for the assassinations were between August 1959 and March 1972, when the “the CIA had its own agenda”. Furthermore, he admits that he was part of an operation team of five members, who were taking orders to carry out the assassinations. Their victims were from all walks of life ranging from journalists, union leaders, political activists, artists, and scientists – all of which were killed because their radical ideas posed a threat to the interests of the United States.Hodges admits that Marilyn Monroe was the only woman he had ever assassinated, a unique target at the time. He claims she had become a significant “threat to the security of the country” and had to be eliminated.“We had evidence that Marilyn Monroe had not only slept with Kennedy but also with Fidel Castro”, says M. Hodges. “My commanding officer, Jimmy Hayworth, told me that she had to die and that it had to look like a suicide or an overdose. I had never killed a woman before, but I obeyed orders… I did it for America! She could have transmitted strategic information to the communists, and we couldn’t allow that! She had to die! I just did what I had to do!”Marilyn Monroe died on the 5th of August 1962. Hodges claims he entered her room while the star was sleeping, injecting her with a fatal dose of Chloral Hydrate (a very powerful sedative) that was also mixed with Nembutal – a short-acting barbiturate, which ultimately caused her death.The FBI is taking Hodges claims very seriously and has now placed him under custody whilst a full investigation is opened to attempt to verify his allegations.The most important witness in the case would have been Major James Hayworth, who died of a heart attack in 2011. Two other CIA assassins who were identified by Hodges are also dead.This could open up many questions about the CIA’s activities in America in that era. What do you think? Why would Hodges say something like this if it weren’t true? Is it all conspiracy garbage? Let us know your thoughts!","Former CIA officer, Normand Hodges, has recently come forward with a shocking set of confessions. He has admitted to being involved in no less than 37 assassinations for the American government between 1959 and 1972 and is claiming involvement in the assassination of actress and model, Marilyn Monroe. Hodges, who is now 78-years-old, says that he carries no regrets for his actions.

Hodges was a member of a group of five CIA agents who were tasked specifically with carrying out assassinations. He was a highly trained operative with top-level security clearances, possessing expertise in martial arts and sniper tactics, as well as proficiency in using a variety of lethal methods, from poisons to explosives.

Despite his elderly age, Hodges has displayed remarkable recall, recounting each of the assassinations that he carried out on American soil. He claims that he was acting on orders from his commanding officer, Major James “Jimmy” Hayworth, between August 1959 and March 1972, when “the CIA had its own agenda”. Hodges admits that the victims of these assassinations came from all aspects of society, ranging from journalists and political activists to union leaders, artists, and scientists. The common thread that tied them all together was their perceived threat to the interests of the United States.

Most strikingly, Hodges confesses that Marilyn Monroe was the only woman he ever assassinated and an unconventional target at that. He claims that she had become a national security risk, thanks to her romantic relationships with both John F Kennedy and Fidel Castro, and that her death was necessary to prevent the transmission of sensitive information to the communists.

Hodges insists he killed Monroe upon the orders of Major Hayworth, who instructed him to stage the murder as a suicide or suicide attempt involving an overdose. Using his expertise in sedative and barbiturate injections, Hodges claims he entered Monroe’s sleeping quarters and injected her with a lethal dose of Chloral Hydrate mixed with Nembutal, causing her death.

The FBI is taking Hodges claims very seriously and has placed him under custody as they open an investigation into his allegations. Of course, with Major Hayworth already deceased and the two other identified CIA assassins also deceased, this investigation is sure to raise many questions about the nature of the CIA’s activities in America during that time period. While some may view these allegations as conspiracy garbage, there is much evidence to suggest that Hodges’ confessions deserve careful examination."

politifact15570,1,1,"A senior Iranian cleric and member of parliament has just dropped a bombshell.He is claiming that the Obama administration, as part of negotiating during the Iran Deal, granted U.S. citizenship to 2500 Iranians including family members of government officials.From Fox News:Hojjat al-Islam Mojtaba Zolnour, who is chairman of Iran’s parliamentary nuclear committee and a member of its national security and foreign affairs committee, made the allegations during an interview with the country’s Etemad newspaper, cited by the country’s Fars News agency. He claimed it was done as a favor to senior Iranian officials linked to President Hassan Rouhani, and he alleged the move sparked a competition among Iranian officials over whose children would benefit from the scheme.Several children of current and former Iranian officials live in the United States, including Ali Fereydoun, whose father is brother and special aide of President Hassan Rouhan, and Fatemeh Ardeshir Larijani, whose father Ali Larijani is speaker of parliament.While Zolnour did not mention any names, he obviously was trying to make a political point.“When Obama, during the negotiations about the JCPOA, decided to do a favor to these men, he granted citizenship to 2,500 Iranians and some officials started a competition over whose children could be part of these 2,500 Iranians,” he claimed. “If today these Iranians get deported from America, it will become clear who is complicit and sells the national interest like he is selling candies to America.” The conservative Zolnour, who is in Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s inner circle, added: “It should be stated exactly which children of which authorities live in the United States and have received citizenship or residency.”He said while some were studying in the U.S. others were working in the U.S. “against our national interests.”It’s not clear who he’s talking about and whether he’s confusing a green card with citizenship. And one has to take his political objective into account.But it obviously raises a concerning question.There have been so many things hidden from the public about the Iran Deal if this was one more thing given up in bribe, it wouldn’t be hard to believe.And it shouldn’t be hard to track this down with a little government and Congressional investigation.The problem, of course, too many Obama holdovers in places like the State Department so you can’t get a straight answer.Asked about the cleric’s claim, a State Department spokesperson said: “We’re not going to comment on every statement by an Iranian official.” Fox News analyst and former Obama State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf was dubious of the Iranian official’s allegation. “This sounds like totally made up BS,” she said. The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment. A representative for Obama Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson also could not be reached for comment.This would certainly anger Republicans, especially in the wake of the pallets of cash, sanctions relief and giving access to the U.S. financial system that has already been revealed about the deal.And in Iran, they could fuel resentment toward Tehran’s elite. “Many ordinary Iranians are surprised and feel betrayed that children of the regime officials live and work in the U.S.,” Saeed Ghasseminejad, a research fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based research institute, told Fox News. “The regime officials chant death to America but send their children to the U.S., away from the hell they have created in Iran over the past four decades.” Ghasseminejad said some Iranians have called for their deportation from America: “Iranians don’t understand why the U.S. government allows the offspring of the regime officials to live in the U.S., while the U.S. has introduced a travel ban for ordinary Iranian citizens and many Americans are imprisoned in Iran. That is why many Iranians on social media have been urging the U.S. government to deport the children of t","A senior Iranian cleric and Member of Parliament has recently alleged that the Obama administration granted citizenship to 2,500 Iranians, including family members of government officials, during the Iran Deal. Hojjat al-Islam Mojtaba Zolnour, who is chairman of Iran’s parliamentary nuclear committee, made the allegations during an interview with a newspaper, adding that it was done as a favor to senior Iranian officials linked to President Hassan Rouhani. This has raised concerns that more has been kept from the public regarding the Iran Deal. While it is not clear who the cleric is speaking of and whether his accusation of citizenship is accurate, it is still a matter that deserves investigation. This latest accusation could prove to be a difficult obstacle for Obama holdovers in government roles, where the problem of a lack of transparency persists."

Upon entering the residence, officers noted a pervasive smell of decomposition. A generator was found running in the kitchen of the property which had no electricity. Thompson, exhibiting aggressive behavior, attempted to flee from police, leading law enforcement officials down into the basement of the property where they were met with a foul odor further intensified by their descent.

His response was chilling. He said:“No, man. I don’t like violence any more than the next guy, but I would hope that if this clown in the White House was about to start a war or somethin’ that someone would do what I did but with a real gun. I know I would and I would encourage anyone who could get close enough to do the same.

While the toy gun aspect of the video may seem harmless to some, a reporter from Breitbart News questioned Snoop Dogg about his use of violence as a form of protest. His response, in which he suggested that someone should use a real gun to stop the president, has led to accusations of a violent threat against the President. The journalist shared his evidence with the Secret Service, and Snoop Dogg was detained as a military combatant, pending further investigation to determine if he poses a threat to the President.

The Obama Administration originally said he was taking the properties in order to punish Russia for meddling in the 2016 election, but that was just a clever ruse to fool the sheeple. To make it look legitimate, he also sanctioned two Russian intelligence services and gave 35 government officials 72 hours to leave the United States.But that was not what any of this was really about. It never is simple or transparent with the criminal Democrats. Obummer’s power play was just a last ditch effort to grab as much free stuff as possible before the door hit him on his corrupt behind on the way out.Once again, we’re really sorry that the poor Obama girls won’t each get a free mansion to trash with their drug, rape and thugs parties. Too bad for you two entitled brats, but maybe you should consider getting a REAL JOB because your days of stealing from hardworking taxpaying Americans are OVER.This is a developing story. Please check back for updates on this breaking scoop.","The Obama Administration has been accused of wrongfully taking ownership of properties in Russia, supposedly as a punishment for their involvement in the 2016 US election. However, it has now been revealed that the move was a ruse to gain free mansions for the Obama family. Reports circulating in Russia have provided evidence to support this claim. The situation was further enforced by the implementation of sanctions against two Russian intelligence services and the eviction of 35 Russian officials from the United States. The entire episode has highlighted a continued lack of transparency from the Democrats' ranks, with their actions being conducted in secrecy. This recent turn of events proves their lack of accountability, particularly in relation to tax-paying citizens. Updates on the situation will be made available as they emerge."
politifact15579,1,1,"The Second Amendment has continuously been under assault in the United States and in the United Nations. Most often, the attacks came from Democrats and other leftists who have long wanted to see a disarmed populace, with only the government and military maintaining access to firearms. Liberals know that an armed population will not willingly become slaves.The United Nations has long worked, on an international level, to undermine the right of individuals to keep and bear arms, particularly the right of Americans to do so. In a recent document, it sounds like representatives of the United States promised “full implementation” of the UN’s gun-control agreement, and in doing so essentially forfeit the Second and Tenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Perhaps most interestingly of all, the mainstream media has been entirely silent on the issue… perhaps they don’t want to laud this win and stir up patriots?The Third Review Conference for the UN’s Programme of Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons concluded at the end of June. Apparently, American ‘representatives’ at the conference agreed to begin developing ‘legal frameworks’ (generally, laws and regulations) that will enforce “proper management” of “small arms and light weapons” stockpiles.It seems that this agreement also includes ‘stockpiles’ owned by American citizens.The United Nations, an extremely corrupt international government organization with a long track record of failure and few (if any) successes to its name, is hoping that the United States will help it to track (and likely, confiscate) firearms in the country.The conference put out a plan that included demands for a massive database of all organizations, parties, and individuals that manufacture, own, sell, trade, or transfer firearms or ammunition.This will serve as a means for the United Nations to find ‘illicit’ ammunition and firearms.Of course, given the UN’s history of pushing for gun control measures, it’s not beyond the pale to believe that the organization would declare wide swaths of firearms illegal, or that home manufacture of ammunition for private use or resale is illegal.If the United States passes a law, or an executive order, to compel it to cooperate with the UN’s gun control objectives, that could mean that the government would actually seize such equipment on behalf of the international agency.However, it gets worse still. The ‘Programme of Action’ also allows UN ‘peacekeepers’ to go to member nations to ‘assist’ in meeting the goals of the program.So, if the organization decides that the United States should hand over its civilian-owned AR-15s for destruction, and then decides that the process is taking too long, they could send their blue helmet and beret-wearing goons to American shores to ‘help’ speed the process up.The conference produced a list of six points to which all member states agreed.Firstly, they all agreed to establish laws in their nations to support the effective implementation of the Programme of Action (PoA).Secondly, they agreed to strengthen ‘coordinated approaches’ nationally for implementing the PoA.Thirdly, they promised to include women in the mechanism related to said implementation.Fourth, the representatives agreed to create a ‘national point of contact’ to act in the role of liaison between nations and the UN.Fifth, they promised to ‘make better use’ of existing data to push various social and corporate policies in order to be ‘in compliance’ with UN demands concerning women, disarmament, and ‘non-proliferation,’ which generally means not making new firearms for the civilian market.Finally, they agreed to ‘significantly reduce’ illicit flows of small arms through means such as ‘voluntary surrender’ programmes and ‘illicit weapons’ recovery.In other words, the United States government is expected to help push an absurdly anti-Second Amendment set of demands on the American people.If they don’t push that set of rules upon the people swiftly enough, the","United Nations may send their own personnel to enforce it. At the recent Third Review Conference for the UN's Programme of Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons, American representatives reportedly committed to developing legal frameworks that would ensure proper management of small arms and light weapons stockpiles, including those owned by American citizens. Furthermore, the UN's plan includes demands for a massive database of all organizations, parties, and individuals involved in the manufacture, ownership, sale, trade, or transfer of firearms or ammunition. This is alarming because given the UN's track record of pushing for gun control measures, it is possible that they may declare wide swaths of firearms illegal, or even go as far as to make home manufacture of ammunition for private use or resale illegal. The UN's Programme of Action also allows peacekeepers to go to member nations to assist in meeting the goals of the program. This may lead to a potential scenario where the UN forces the US to hand over civilian-owned firearms for destruction or even send their own personnel to enforce the demands. American citizens have the right to be concerned about this situation, and it is essential to monitor the actions of the UN on American soil closely."

politifact14745,1,0,"Read original article hereLiberals sure are afraid of Roy Moore. Not only did they push a woman in front of the cameras to cry and lie about some stuff that allegedly happened 35 years ago she’s just now remembering to mention (we refuse to repeat the salacious allegations because they are 100% verifiable fake news) but when the fake 14-year-old didn’t work for them, the Democrat Party did something even worse: they doubled down on the story, introduced a new actress, and had her tell an even more horrible lie.Fiona Dourif says she was 11 years old when Moore “groped her in the alley behind the” church they both attended in 1957. “It was the most horrifying moment of my life,” she told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow on Friday night. She then described the series of events that allegedly happened, including the obviously false allegation that he baited her into the alley with candy. “Roy Moore definitely did all of those things and more,” she said looking into the camera, dry-eyed.Maddow then interviewed Dourif’s parents, who said that they knew of the alleged abuse but didn’t say anything until he was running for Senator because they “feared for their lives.” Of course, if that was the case they would not have waited until he had more political power and wealth than he did when this allegedly happened.One piece of information Dourif failed to mention is that she is currently employed as a housekeeper for Michelle Obama at the D.C. mansion “she” and her “husband” Barack share. This information was uncovered by Gateway Pundit’s Charles C. Johnson, who notes in his report that “Dourif is paid extremely well according to public documents, which report a $250,783.33 annual salary for Dourif.”“Why would Barack and Michelle Obama’s housekeeper suddenly remember that she was molested by someone who is running for public office – someone of the opposing party,” Johnson writes. “This stinks more than Malia Obama’s dorm room after one of her reefer parties.”What exactly is going on? Ever since it her employer was revealed, Dourif has gone dark, removing all of her social media presences and refusing to respond to interview requests from any source.","The recent allegations against Roy Moore have been met with great political fervor, with both sides of the aisle feeling the weight of the situation. One woman, who claims that Moore engaged in inappropriate sexual behavior when she was a teenager, recently came forward with her allegations. While these accusations have yet to be proven, some have questioned the veracity of her claims, noting that she waited decades to make them known. In response, the Democratic Party introduced a new accuser, Fiona Dourif, who alleged that Moore molested her when she was just 11 years old. However, since her allegations have come to light, questions have arisen about her credibility. For example, it has been revealed that Dourif is currently employed as a housekeeper for Michelle Obama, which has raised concerns about the motivations behind her accusations. Despite these questions, Dourif has not come forward to respond to any requests for interviews, leaving the public to wonder what exactly is going on in this complex case."
politifact15123,1,1,"EspañolThe current influenza season has been especially difficult, causing widespread illness that has affected all fifty states and resulted in a record number of hospitalizations. While healthcare professionals continue to combat this year’s flu – which may continue to affect Americans into April – we’re already partnering with other public health agencies to conduct essential work to produce next season’s influenza vaccines.As part of this process, we’re striving to better understand why we saw reduced effectiveness of this year’s influenza vaccines against one strain of influenza A, called H3N2. It was this strain that caused much of the influenza-related illness this flu season. Moreover, this year is not the first time we have seen vaccines be less effective against this particular strain of influenza, H3N2.As such, we are taking a number of actions to better understand why effectiveness tends to be lower against the H3N2 strain and what we can do about it. By looking closely at the available data and applying the lessons we learn each flu season to the vaccine development process, we offer the greatest chance of developing vaccines that even more effectively prevent the flu in the future.These lessons may be applied not only to enhancing the most prevalent process for developing influenza vaccine in eggs, but to considering whether greater investment in alternative processes such as cell-based or recombinant approaches to vaccine development are required. With this statement, I want to outline what we’ve learned so far about this season’s vaccines and the steps we’re taking and plan to take to determine the root cause of this year’s findings and better prepare for future flu seasons.Reduced effectiveness of 2017-2018 seasonal vaccines against H3N2There are a number of theories on why this season’s vaccines produced reduced effectiveness against H3N2. We’re taking steps to investigate each of these potential causes, rule out possible reasons for the variation in effectiveness and improve vaccine efficacy against H3N2. Overall, preliminary vaccine effectiveness reported by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for H3N2 influenza was 25 percent, which means that people who received the vaccine were 25 percent less likely to be sick and need to see a doctor.While that finding isn’t too far off from the vaccine effectiveness seen against H3N2 in previous years, we need to take new steps to improve vaccine efficacy against H3N2. Of note, the effectiveness of the vaccine against H3N2 in children 6 months to 8 years of age was 51 percent this season, yet the effectiveness in those 65 years and older was only 17 percent, and the effectiveness in older children and adults under 65 years of age was even lower. The vaccines did do much better for other viruses that are also causing the flu this season. The data show that overall vaccine effectiveness for H1N1 and influenza B was 67 percent and 42 percent, respectively, for all age groups combined.So why did this season’s vaccines not deliver higher protection against H3N2? And why have vaccines in prior seasons when H3N2 circulated, also delivered reduced protection against this particular flu strain?We don’t think it was a question of getting the particular H3N2 strain wrong when we set out to produce this season’s flu vaccines. Although adapting circulating virus strains for manufacture can lead to differences between the circulating strain and the one used for manufacturing that could affect effectiveness, so far the data we have suggests that the viruses provided by reference laboratories to manufacturers to make this year’s vaccines do reasonably match the circulating flu strains that are causing most of the illnesses, including H3N2.However, we’re working with our colleagues at CDC and other federal agencies to examine and address other factors that might be contributing to the less than optimal overall protection provided by this season’s vaccines against influenza. We would particularly like to understand why vaccine effectiveness against H3N2 influenza year-to-year tends to be lower than effectiveness against other influenza viruses.Working to determine the root causesToward these ends, scientists at FDA are collaborating with colleagues at Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to use a large database that includes details of the flu vaccines administered to four million individuals along with whether they were hospitalized for influenza or treated with antiviral medications for influenza-like illness. This work, which is still underway, will try to better understand why overall effectiveness with both the cell-based and egg-based vaccines was less than optimal. We’re also looking at the difference in effectiveness in people 65 years and older who were vaccinated with high-dose influenza vaccine and adjuvanted influenza vaccine to see if effectiveness was better than in those vaccinated with standard dose vaccines. The adjuvanted influenza vaccine contains an ingredient meant to boost the immune system’s response to the vaccine while high dose vaccines contain four times as much of the influenza material or antigen as standard vaccines. What we learn about the differences in efficacy between these different vaccines might reveal information that can inform why overall effectiveness against H3N2 was lagging.What might this information reveal? One theory is that people might require a higher amount of H3N2 antigen to elicit a proper immune response to that particular strain of influenza. As I noted previously, the work conducted with CMS shows a preliminary finding that suggests the cell-based influenza vaccine might be somewhat more effective than the egg-based vaccine. We are working to follow up on that finding. We’re also combing through the data to see if there are other reasons for why this season’s vaccines were less effective against H3N2. Our scientists are currently working internally and collaborating with others inside and outside of the federal government to understand all of these findings.The knowledge we gain through such scientific research will allow us to determine if we need to change recommendations to vaccine manufacturers for how future season’s vaccines should be produced.Looking ahead to the 2018-2019 flu seasonWhile this scientific work is underway, the composition of next season’s flu vaccines will be the subject of an FDA advisory committee","The current influenza season has been particularly challenging, affecting people in all fifty states and causing record numbers of hospitalizations. Although healthcare professionals are continuing to tackle the current flu, work is already underway with public health agencies to create next season’s influenza vaccines.

Efforts are focused on understanding why this year’s vaccines had reduced effectiveness against H3N2, a virus strain that caused a significant amount of the flu-related illness this season. Notably, this is not the first time that a vaccine has had a lower effectiveness rate against H3N2.

To address this issue, we are actively taking steps to investigate why these vaccines have had lower efficacy rates and what we can do to improve them. By closely evaluating the available data, we can apply the lessons learned from each flu season to improve the vaccine development process.

These lessons may be applied not only to enhance the egg-based process used for developing the influenza vaccine, but also to explore whether alternative approaches such as cell-based or recombinant methods have greater potential.

To date, preliminary CDC vaccine effectiveness figures indicate that the rate of protection against H3N2 was only 25 percent. While this is not too dissimilar to previous years, it is evident that we must take new steps to improve the vaccine effectiveness, particularly in older people for whom this year’s vaccines had a much lower efficacy rate.

Why did this year’s vaccines exhibit lower efficacy? Although we don’t believe it was a question of selecting the wrong H3N2 strain for this year's vaccines, we are working closely with CDC and other public health bodies to determine the root cause of the reduced effectiveness and how we can continue to prepare for future flu seasons.

One of the theories we are investigating is whether higher quantities of H3N2 antigen are required to elicit the desired immune response for this particular strain of influenza. Other factors may also be involved, and we are collaborating with a range of external partners to gain a comprehensive understanding of the issue.

As we work to understand the root causes of this year’s findings, we will continue to refine our recommendations to vaccine manufacturers, paving the way for a more successful 2018-2019 flu season. An FDA advisory committee will also be convened to discuss the composition of next season’s flu vaccines."
politifact15525,1,1,"It was June 2014 when the Washington Post reported that illegal immigrants, “including thousands of women and children, stream into south Texas. It was nine months late when the same paper reported that Obama’s border agents were tossing some of those kids into internment camps as an experiment.It was called the Juvenile Referral Process, and it worried human rights groups Mexican officials who feared that it put the kids at risk. The program was the creation of Robert Harris who at the time U.S. Customs and Border Protection commander of the Laredo sector. Harris believed holding certain young Mexicans, believed to be working for cartels in detention serves to get these kids out of the smuggling enterprise. Believed is the operative word, There were no judges, no charges– no trial–just belief.His intelligence analysts estimated that 78 percent of the guides smuggling other migrants were Mexicans younger than 18 — teenagers often hired or conscripted by drug cartels that knew they would not be prosecuted if caught — and he wanted to attack this loophole. “Why don’t we remove these juveniles from the smuggling cycle?” Harris, the outgoing commander of the Laredo sector of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, recalled thinking. Trending: Journalist Laura Loomer Files Assault Charges Against Maxine Waters Now, as a result of that decision, young Mexicans are being held for months without charge in shelters across the United States, sometimes without their parents’ knowledge. Since the program began in May, 536 juveniles have been held — 248 of whom have been deported to Mexico after an average stay of 75 days, according to Border Patrol statistics. Mexican authorities say some of these repeat border-crossers have spent as much as six months in U.S. custody while they await an appearance before an immigration judge. During their detention, they are questioned by U.S. authorities and then transferred to a network of facilities run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, part of the Department of Health and Human Services, across 15 states.Lets put this in perspective, under Trump children are separated from their parents because they don’t want the kids going to jail with their parents. Under Obama, young illegal immigrants were put in “facilities” so they could be squeezed for any information they may or may not have about drug cartels.“Our concern is that the program’s real intent is to interrogate the kids,” said Maureen Meyer, an expert on Mexico and migrants at the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA). The kids are “often questioned about the criminal groups they are working for and then subsequently returned to Mexico with no apparent concern about the implications for them.” While in custody last year [2014], one Mexican boy who worked as a guide shared information with U.S. authorities about the location of stash houses used by migrants as they move through the United States, according to his lawyer’s written summary of his case. When he returned to Mexico, he learned that armed men had forced their way into his home and killed a relative’s son. The men told the family that there had been raids on cartel hideouts and arrests and that they believed the boy was responsible. His half-brother was later killed by the same group. The boy, his lawyer said, has since been in hiding. Harris said the Border Patrol does not have a system to track what happens to the juveniles once they return to Mexico. The program does appear to be discouraging them from returning illegally to Texas, he said. The patrol calculates that just 7 percent of the children who have gone through the program has been picked up again crossing the border.But the program was a surprise to Mexico“The moment it started, it took us all by surprise, because there wasn’t an announcement,” said Reyna Torres Mendívil, director general of the Mexican Foreign Ministry’s office for protection of Mexicans abroad. “Where were they taking these children?”Regarding prevent","In June of 2014, The Washington Post reported that a large number of illegal immigrants, including women and children, were flooding into south Texas. Several months later, the newspaper reported that young immigrants, including children, were being placed into internment camps as part of a program to remove them from the trafficking cycle operated by drug cartels. Human rights organizations, as well as Mexican officials, expressed their concerns regarding this program, which was called the Juvenile Referral Process.

The program was initiated by Robert Harris, who was the Commander of the Laredo sector of U.S. Customs and Border Protection at the time. His intelligence analysts had detected that a significant number of the individuals assisting with the smuggling of other migrants were Mexican children under the age of 18. Cartels would either hire or conscript teenagers to work for them, knowing that they could get away with it since these children would not be prosecuted if caught. Harris believed that removing young Mexicans working for cartels from the smuggling enterprise was the solution to this loophole.

Consequently, young Mexicans, being held without charge, are now being detained in shelters across the United States for months, sometimes without their parent's knowledge, after being apprehended by border agents. Since May, 536 juveniles have been held, and 248 individuals have been deported back to Mexico after a stay averaging 75 days, according to statistics from the Border Patrol. Mexican authorities claim that some of these repeat border-crossers have spent up to six months in U.S. custody awaiting an appearance before an immigration judge. During their detention, they are questioned by U.S. authorities before being transferred to a network of facilities run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement across 15 different states.

In contrast to Donald Trump's policy of separating children from their parents to prevent them from being incarcerated together, Barack Obama's strategy sought to gather information from young illegal immigrants about drug cartels. However, this program stirred up several concerns, with experts stating that the purpose of this program was to interrogate the children. While in detention, these kids were often questioned about the criminal organizations they worked for and were subsequently returned to Mexico without any apparent concern about the implications for them.

Maureen Meyer, an expert on Mexico and migrants at the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA), stressed that ""Our concern is that the program's real intent is to interrogate the kids."" The interrogation focused on the criminal groups that the children were working for and then returned to Mexico without any apparent concern about the implications. Mexican children who provided information about certain criminal organizations they were working for were punished for their cooperation by group members. This was seen in the case of a young Mexican boy who was placed in hiding after returning to Mexico. U.S. authorities were not tracking the children after they were returned to Mexico.

While the program appears to be effective as it informs only 7% of children that go through the program have been caught illegally crossing the border again, questions raise. The Mexican government's office for the protection of Mexicans abroad was taken by surprise when the program was initiated. Reyna Torres Mendivil states ""The moment it started, it took us all by surprise, because there wasn't an announcement. Where were they taking these children?"""

Earth has a companion in space which has been orbiting our world for over a century, and NASA has only recently spotted it.According to new reports from NASA, there is a quasi-moon orbiting around Earth for almost a century, and we have missed it all along.The new moon isn’t as big as THE MOON is, but, it still keeps our original moon company while traveling across space.The smaller quasi-moon orbits Earth with an extremely irregular path. Moon 2.0 is actually asteroid 2016 H03, which is locked into a dance with our planet, in fact, it has been dancing with our planet for almost a century and we have failed to notice it until recently.

politifact14205,1,1,"Moscow | National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden has made a new controversial claim yesterday, saying that he possessed some classified information proving that Osama Bin Laden is still alive.Snowden, who lives as a fugitive in Russia after leaking documents about the NSA’s surveillance programs has made some previously unreported allegations about the famous terrorist, Osama Bin Laden, during an interview with the Moscow Tribune.According to him, not only is Bin Laden still alive, but he is living a lavish lifestyle in the Bahamas, thanks to regular payments from the CIA.“I have documents showing that Bin Laden is still on the CIA’s payroll,” claims Edward Snowden. “He is still receiving more than $100,000 a month, which are being transferred through some front businesses and organizations, directly to his Nassau bank account. I am not certain where he is now, but in 2016, he was living quietly in his villa with five of his wives and many children.”Mr. Snowden says the CIA orchestrated the fake death of the former leader of Al Qaeda, while he was actually transported with his family to an undisclosed location in the Bahamas.“Osama Bin Laden was one of the CIA’s most efficient operatives for a long time,” claims the famous whistleblower. “What kind of message would it send their other operatives if they were to let the SEALs kill him? They organized his fake death with the collaboration of the Pakistani Secret services, and he simply abandoned his cover. Since everyone believes he is dead, nobody’s looking for him, so it was pretty easy to disappear. Without the beard and the military jacket, nobody recognizes him.”Mr. Snowden says that the documents proving that Bin Laden is still alive will be integrally reproduced in his new book, expected to be released in September.Edward Snowden was hired by an NSA contractor in 2013 after previous employment with Dell and the CIA. In the month of June of the same year, he revealed thousands of classified NSA documents to journalists.The US government filed espionage charges against him shortly after his revelations were made public. He has been living under asylum in Moscow, after fleeing the US for Hong Kong in the wake of the leaks.On July 28, 2015, the White House has rejected a “We the People” petition of nearly 168,000 signatories, to pardon him.","National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden has once again made headlines with a bold statement alleging that Osama Bin Laden is, in fact, still alive. Snowden, currently residing in Russia, revealed the classified information during an interview with the Moscow Tribune. According to Snowden, Bin Laden is living a comfortable life in the Bahamas, courtesy of regular six-figure payments from the CIA. In his claim, Snowden notes that the former Al Qaeda leader was one of the CIA’s most successful operatives before being given a false death in 2011. Snowden asserts that Bin Laden was transported to an undisclosed location in the Bahamas, where he currently resides with his family. Snowden’s revelation is set to be further detailed in his upcoming book, slated to be released next month. It is important to note that Snowden made similar allegations in 2014 in an interview with a German newspaper, although at that time, his claims were met with skepticism from the intelligence community. Regardless, Snowden’s previous actions firmly cement his credibility as a whistleblower and will undoubtedly make his new claim a topic of interest for many."

During this same week last year, CNN averaged 1.191 million. That is a -29 percent collapse.CNN’s average total day viewers disintegrated by -25 percent, 841K compared to 635K.In other words, throughout the day last week, CNN could only attract an average of 635,000 total viewers.Fox News, however, is thriving. Last week, Fox averaged 2.487 million primetime viewers, nearly three times that of CNN’s 844K, and 1.463 million total day viewers, more than twice CNN’s 635K.While MSNBC is in a distant second place behind Fox, it is still leaving CNN in the dust with an average of 1.667 million primetime viewers and 913K total day viewers.Incredibly, CNN’s second week of May this year was even worse than the first week, which was already catastrophic. During week one, CNN attracted a dismal 859K primetime viewers, but that was still better than week two, which dropped even further to 844K.

MSNBC more than doubled CNN with 1.93 million.The bottom line is that CNN’s ongoing and well-documented credibility crisis has now come home to roost as a five-alarm ratings crisis.","CNN's ratings have experienced a significant decrease, with viewership dropping by a staggering 30 percent during the second week of May. While Fox News has seen an increase of 6 percent in total viewers, CNN's numbers have plummeted, raising concerns about the network's future. The problem seems to be compounded by CNN's perceived lack of credibility, evident in its widely criticized news coverage. During the crucial primetime hours, CNN was only able to secure an average of 844,000 total viewers, a notable decrease from the 1.191 million viewers during the same period last year. Similarly, the network's total day viewership fell by 25 percent from 841,000 to 635,000. Meanwhile, Fox News demonstrated strong performance, with an average of 2.487 million primetime viewers and 1.463 million total day viewers. MSNBC was not far behind with an average of 1.667 million and 913,000 primetime viewers and total day viewers, respectively. The numbers from the second week of May are proof that CNN's ratings crisis is far from over, and there are concerns that the third week could be even worse. The network's credibility issues appear to be taking a significant toll on its viewership numbers, which do not seem to be recovering anytime soon."
politifact13942,1,0,"The government has implemented a new regulation requiring a governor to be placed on all motorcycles by mid-January 2017. The purpose of the mandatory governor would be to prevent motorcyclists from exceeding a speed of 75- miles per hour. The regulation aims to drastically reduce the amount of annual motorcycle fatalities in the United States.Many are not surprised by the regulation as politicians have been asking for stricter safety features to be implemented on motorcycles for the past several decades. In 2014, the government offered all major motorcycle manufactures including Harley-Davidson, Yamaha, Honda, Ducati, Kawasaki, Suzuki, and BMW a large tax-incentive to begin implementing governors on all newly manufactured motorcycles, however to much surprise, all relevant manufactures declined to take advantage of the additional tax-incentive, requiring government officials to return to the drawing board.Members of the U.S. Department of Transportation or U.D.O.T were supportive of the regulation and heavily involved in its roll-out. According to U.S. Department of Transportation representative James Littleton, the motorcycle governor regulation was long past due and made a comparison to the governors placed on traditional automobiles. Littleton told reporters during a press-conference that each year approximately 8,265 motorcycle fatalities occur throughout the United States. According to Littleton, the vast majority (approximately 73%) of motorcycle fatalities are the result of motorcyclists driving at unsafe speeds.When asked why the regulation would only allow motorcyclists to maintain a speed below 75-miles per hour, Littleton made the following comment to reporters, “This is a crucial safety regulation that should have been implemented at least 20-years ago, now that we are finally implementing it, we want to ensure we do it right. With the exception of a few states that allow for 80-miles per mile freeway driving (Idaho, Montana, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming) and Texas who allows for speeds of up to 85-miles per hour on the freeway, most states allow a maximum speed of 75-miles per hour. We wanted to make it easy for motorcyclists in most all states to easily obey their respective posted speed limit.”According to Littleton, motorcyclists in the few states that periodically allow for speeds exceeding 75-miles per hour, governors allowing speeds up to 80-85-miles per hour may eventually be implemented, however in the meantime, police officials in these states have been given direction to avoid citing motorcyclists for such infractions as obstructing the flow of traffic when relevant.Officials expect all motorcyclists and motorcycle manufactures to be in compliance with the new regulation by mid to late January 2017, however may file for a temporary 30, 60, or 90-day extension under select circumstances. According to Littleton, citations and fines will be imposed on both motorcyclists and motorcycle manufactures who fail to remain in compliance with the regulation.According to Littleton, designated motorcycle mechanic and auto-body shops in each state will be permitted to install the mandatory governors on motorcycles manufactured and sold prior to the implementation of the regulation at a subsidized rate. Littleton did not have details regarding the government subsidized repair readily available, however told reporters that he expects the subsidized cost to be around $35 to the consumer.Littleton concluded the press conference by informing reporters that the U.S Department of Transportation is currently working diligently to release all relevant information pertaining to the new regulation on the U.D.O.T website.","The government is imposing a new regulation that requires all motorcycles to have a governor installed by mid-January 2017. The purpose of this regulation is to enforce a speed limit of 75-miles per hour on motorcyclists, with the ultimate goal of significantly reducing the number annual motorcycle fatalities in the United States. There has been a long-standing appeal from politicians for the implementation of stricter safety measures on motorcycles, and the US government offered tax incentives to major manufacturers to begin incorporating governors into their motorcycles in 2014. Unfortunately, none of these manufacturers, which included Harley-Davidson, Yamaha, Honda, Ducati, Kawasaki, Suzuki, and BMW, chose to take advantage of these incentives, sending the government back to the drawing board. 

The US Department of Transportation (U.D.O.T) is heavily involved in the new regulation, with representative James Littleton leading the charge. Littleton explained that governors are long overdue on motorcycles, and compared it to the governors placed on traditional cars. According to Littleton, motorcycle fatalities account for approximately 8,265 deaths each year in the United States, with the vast majority (around 73%) being attributed to unsafe speeds. 

When asked about the speed limit of 75-miles per hour, Littleton clarified that it is designed to correspond with the maximum speed limit of most states. States that permit higher speeds, such as Idaho, Montana, South Dakota, Utah, Wyoming, and Texas, which allows for speeds up to 85-miles per hour, may eventually be allowed to have governors that permit higher speeds. Until then, police in these states have been advised not to issue citations for exceeding speed limits. 

The new regulation is expected to be complied with by mid to late January 2017, with temporary extensions of up to 90 days granted in select circumstances. Littleton warned that failure to comply with the new regulation may result in citations and fines for both riders and manufacturers. To ease the implementation, designated motorcycle mechanic and auto-body shops will be subsidized to install governors on motorcycles that were sold before the regulation’s implementation, with the cost to the consumer expected to be around $35.

The U.D.O.T is currently working on releasing all the pertinent information regarding the new regulation on its official website, with Littleton assuring the public that the website will be updated as soon as possible."

The shock wave jolted people from their beds as much as a mile and a half away.‘As per standard protocol and procedures, this report details, SVR analysts, in their replying to the MoD’s request for information about this “event”, conducted a database search of the two persons named as having been killed in this explosion– Carole Paladino, age 72, and her husband John Paladino, age 73—with, and very surprisingly to them, a SVR database “target hit” on Carole Paladino being revealed as she had previously been identified by SVR analysts as being a “probable witness” against the Clinton Foundation.,‘Now deceased Carole Paladino was the lead school nurse for Millville Public Schools located in Cumberland County, New Jersey—and whose inclusion in the SVR’s database of “potential witnesses” against the Clinton Foundation was due to her being a “central identified and named figure” in the creation of a document titled “Training Protocols For The Emergency Administration Of Epinephrine” for the New Jersey Department of Education.’‘Epinephrine (also called adrenaline), this report explains, is a hormone used to treat anaphylaxis—that is a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death—and whose administering of is done via a medical device known as an epinephrine auto-injector (EpiPen)—and that the Carole Paladino collaborated on report for its “emergency administration” led New Jersey to pass a law requiring all schools in their State, both public and private, to purchase it—and their passing another law allowing New Jersey school nurses to, also, use EpiPens without parental permission.’‘Whether knowingly, or not knowingly, Carole Paladino, by her being a “main target” person in the plot to force all New Jersey schools to purchase EpiPens, she became embroiled in one of the largest medical scams ever known in US history—that began when the American global generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company Mylan N.V. suddenly began funneling money to the Clinton Foundation—and that nearly immediately after which, saw Gayle Conelly Manchin take over as the head of the National Association of State Boards of Education—and who spearheaded an unprecedented effort that encouraged States to require schools to purchase medical devices that fight life-threatening allergic reactions—that, in turn, helped pave the way for Mylan N.V., maker of EpiPens, to develop a near monopoly in school nurses’ offices throughout the United States—with New Jersey is one of the 11 States drafting laws requiring epinephrine auto-injectors be bought by schools—and that the Obama-Clinton regime conspired with using their “EpiPen Law” that gave funding preference to States that did what Gayle Conelly Manchin told them to do.’‘Unbeknownst to the American people, this report notes, is that Gayle Conelly Manchin is the mother of Heather Bresch—who, in 2012, right after her mother took control of the National Association of State Boards of Education and began her campaign to force schools to buy EpiPens—became the CEO of EpiPen maker Mylan N.V.—with Heather Bresch, upon taking control, raising the price of EpiPens over 400% to $600 per dose and skyrocketing her personal worth to over $27 million—and whose “protection” for this vile plot was provided by her father, and Gayle Conelly Manchin’s husband, Democratic Party US Senator Joe Manchin.’‘To an even greater scandal-catastrophe awaiting Hillary Clinton, as it dwarfs too near insignificance her EpiPen one, this report further notes, is her “active and knowing” participation in the United States opioid crisis—that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns whose drug overdoses attributed to in the US have increased by 13.3 percent from August 2016 to August 2017, and now total 67,344 deaths per year—nearly all of which were deliberately caused by Oxycontin-maker Purdue Pharma—who, after funneling tens-of-millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation, saw the Obama-Clinton regime to a “blind eye” to their flooding of America with opioids—and as exampled by Democratic Party US Senator Joe Manchin’s home State of West Virginia being flooded with more than 780 million opioid pills, that roughly equals 433 pills for every man, woman, and child in his State.’‘This report, after describing the","tragic events of a house explosion in New Jersey, must clarify that there is no evidence of foul play. The couple who perished in the explosion, John Paladino and Carole Paladino, were longtime residents of the area. However, there have been unsubstantiated claims linking Carole Paladino's potential testimony against the Clinton Foundation to the explosion. The expected testimony concerned a pharmaceutical company that had donated to the Clinton Foundation, allegedly in an effort to cover up their drug price gouging crimes. This claim is part of a larger narrative that suggests there is a ""Clinton body count"". It should be noted that there is no factual basis for such claims and they should be viewed as unfounded conspiracy theories. Regardless, this tragedy has brought attention to the important issue of medical scams in the US, such as EpiPen price gouging, and the devastating impact of the opioid crisis."

Neither, according to the State Board of Elections.The true explanation is much less exciting.Prior to passage of the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) in 1993, the state did not require those registering to provide their birth date. While most voters who registered before NVRA did provide birth dates, some did not. These voters were automatically assigned a default birth date of 01/01/1900 in the state’s voter rolls.

Prior to the enactment of the National Voter Registration Act in 1993, the state did not require voters to provide their date of birth upon registering. While most voters did provide such information, some failed to do so. As such, these individuals were then assigned the default birth date of 01/01/1900 on the state's voter rolls.

politifact15048,1,1,"It’s no surprise that one of the most hated people in the entire world is George Soros. This liberal billionaire has used his massive wealth and resources to essentially control the Democratic Party. Which is why if Hillary Clinton had won the presidential election, she would have been listening to Soros.When you’re done imaging that nightmare scenario, it’s important to realize that the fight isn’t over yet. Hillary might have lost the election, but Soros is still out there, mobilizing and planning more moves that seek to dismantle the Donald Trump presidency.That’s why Trump finally had enough and is going to charge Soros as a “threat to national security” in the United States. Considering that this is the same man that has mobilized and paid protesters to create a tremendous amount of damage, it’s been a long time coming for this order.Trump had placed a call to Russia to ask about “any and all” files that are related to Soros. He was able to do this thanks to the 2014 Executive Order that was signed by President Obama, entitled “Blocking Property of Certain Persons Contributing to the Situation in Ukraine.”“I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, find that the actions and policies of persons that undermine democratic processes and institutions in Ukraine; threaten its peace, security, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity; and contribute to the misappropriation of its assets, constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat.”Nearly a month after this order was signed US diplomatic cables show that Soros did “undermine the processes and institutions in Ukraine.” Due to Soros’s illegal intervention into a peaceful transition of power, mass conflict erupted and an estimated 9,600 men, women, and children lost their lives.Clearly that is interfering in the process. So why didn’t President Obama charge Soros as a threat to the United States national security? It’s because Soros flooded Obama and Hillary’s Democratic Party with about $100 million in donations. You really think that Obama is going to charge someone that has donated that much to their party?Soros began his takeover back in 2004, as he declared “it is the central focus of my life” and “a matter of life and death” to push his influence on the American people and our democracy. While 2004 failed, Soros had turned to 2016 and had become Hillary’s highest donor. We know that Hillary listens to people that donate to her, so she would have been listening to Soros the entire time.Now that the Democratic Party has been completely defeated, Soros is doing what he can to go against President Trump, saying “democracy is now in crisis.” Soros has been active in his fight against Trump, as he was discovered to have been the mastermind behind paying protesters to cause as much damage and destruction as possible.During the election season, there were several Black Lives Matter protests that quickly turned violent. These protesters started riots, went up against the police force, and generally made life difficult for law-abiding citizens. Then came a report that Soros was paying these protesters around $15 an hour to protest, and they would have their expenses paid for.It didn’t just stop at the Black Lives Matter protests either. There were several protests against Trump during the election season that turned violent. Again, another report circulated that protesters were getting paid to cause as much destruction as possible.Considering that one of these protests actually shut down a speech that Trump had planned to make, it’s safe to say that they were effective at the time. Not to mention that these people were endangering other people around them and creating a lot of problems for the police forces that were assigned to them.It’s about time that Trump did something against Soros. This man has been responsible for fund","It is widely known and heavily discussed that George Soros, a wealthy supporter of liberal causes, is disliked by many individuals around the world. He has used his extensive resources to exert significant control over the Democratic Party, causing alarm about his influence on political decisions if Hillary Clinton had in fact been elected president. Although the election results did not turn out that way, the prospect of Soros's continued influence on the US political system is concerning. As such, President Trump has announced that he plans to charge Soros as a ""threat to national security"" within the United States. This move was possible thanks to an Executive Order signed by former president Obama in 2014, which identified individuals who were contributing to the situation in Ukraine and undermining democratic processes within that country. Diplomatic cables suggest that Soros had contravened these particular rules, contributing to the turmoil that took place in Ukraine in 2014 and leading to the deaths of thousands.

The question then becomes: why didn't Obama take action against Soros at the time? It appears that the billionaire has donated a significant amount to the Democratic party over the years, making it unlikely that the former president would pursue charges against him. The extent of Soros's influence over the Democratic Party is astounding, with the billionaire declaring back in 2004 that it was the central focus of his life to push his influence on the American people and their democracy. Funding from Soros has been linked to protests, some of which turned violent, occurring during both the Black Lives Matter and 2016 presidential election protests. Soros's efforts to disrupt the Trump presidency have been ongoing, with the billionaire rallying against what he sees as a democracy in crisis.

Given the tumultuous nature of the current political climate, it is perhaps for the best that Soros faces consequences for his actions. Donald Trump's decision to pursue charges against Soros will no doubt have many individuals feeling a sense of relief that someone is finally taking action against such a powerful and influential individual, who has been responsible for financial support of impactful, destructive protests around the country."

You pretend you are patriots, but you are anything but a patriot.”The mother of Fields told the Associated Press on Saturday night that she knew her son was attending a rally in Virginia but didn’t know it was a white supremacist rally.“I thought it had something to do with Trump. Trump’s not a white supremacist,” Samantha Bloom said, before becoming visibly upset as she learned of the injuries and deaths at the rally “He had an African-American friend …,” she said before her voice trailed off.Responding to the events in Charlottesville from Bedminster, New Jersey, Trump: “We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides.”But the Republican senator Marco Rubio tweeted that it was important for Trump to describe the events as a “terror attack by white supremacists”.The FBI said it was opening a civil rights investigation into the accident along with the justice department’s civil rights division and the district attorney’s office.The US attorney general, Jeff Sessions, said: “The violence and deaths in Charlottesville strike at the heart of American law and justice. When such actions arise from racial bigotry and hatred, they betray our core values and cannot be tolerated.NBC News (@NBCNews) WATCH: White nationalists and counter-protesters clash at Charlottesville rally https://t.co/4qH1yJjrGyThe car attack came about two hours after state police in riot gear had cleared Emancipation Park, the site of the Robert E Lee statue. The city’s decision in February to remove the statue drew earlier protests by the “alt-right” and the Ku Klux Klan.Riot police cleared the park after almost an hour of clashes. The far-right groups were largely compliant, but had to run the gauntlet of counter-protesters as they walked west along Market Street.After a brief stalemate, a hard core of about 100 far-right protesters moved to a park two miles away and gathered to hear speakers who had been scheduled for the “Unite the Right” event.One of the speakers, the far-right figurehead Richard Spencer, said he had been maced on the way in and lashed out at police and city authorities.Facebook Twitter Pinterest Rescue personnel help injured people after a car ran into a large group. Photograph: Steve Helber/AP“Never in my life have I felt like the government was cracking down on me until today,” said Spencer. “We came in peace and we were effectively thrown to the wolves.”He said that they would not back down from protesting against the statue. When he mentioned Mayor Signer by name, the crowd chanted: “Jew! Jew! Jew!”Around the park, members of the far right were nursing and treating minor wounds. One of them, who declined to give his name, was bleeding from the head, and claimed to have been struck with an iron bar. Another young man, with a swastika tattoo on his chest and blood on his forehead, told photographers: “If you take my picture, I’ll cut you. I’m not even kidding.”Meanwhile, counter-protesters were trying to stop the far-right groups from entering the park. Some counter-protesters, including many marching under red and black anti-fascist banners, tried to block the streets. This led to altercations with far-right groups, who were seen using chemical weapons, sticks and shields on people.A group of clergy linked arms to block a set of stairs leading into the park. The Rev Seth Wispelwey, of Sojourners United Church of Christ in Charlottesville, said:","A 32-year-old woman from Charlottesville, Virginia has died and 19 have been injured after a car rammed into a group of people protesting against a white supremacist rally. On Saturday afternoon, a young man was arrested and charged with murder following the attack that took place at Charlottesville, Virginia. James Fields, aged 20 and from Ohio, was charged with second degree murder along with three counts of malicious wounding and failing to stop at an accident resulting in a death. While President Trump condemned the “violence on many sides,” he came under widespread criticism for his failure to denounce the far-right demonstrators. In a separate and tragic incident, two police officers who were monitoring the Far-Right rally died when their helicopter crashed, outside Charlottesville. The day was marked by scenes of violence and clashes between Far-Right nationalists and those who had come out to protest against them in a downtown park. The car plowed into innocent protestors at a peaceful rally against white supremacists. Witnesses say that the driver, a skinny white man with a straggly beard who has been identified as James Fields, reversed and drove away from the scene. In response to the tragedy, an investigation has begun by the FBI, the justice department’s civil rights division and the district attorney’s office. US Attorney General Jeff Sessions condemned the violence and reiterated that it was an unacceptable act of racial bigotry and hatred that betrayed American law and justice."
politifact14940,1,0,"Full text: Jeff Flake on Trump speech transcriptPrepared remarks for Sen. Jeff Flake, who delivered a speech to the Senate on Jan. 17, 2018.Mr. President, near the beginning of the document that made us free, our Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson wrote: “We hold these truths to be self-evident...” So, from our very beginnings, our freedom has been predicated on truth. The founders were visionary in this regard, understanding well that good faith and shared facts between the governed and the government would be the very basis of this ongoing idea of America.Story Continued BelowAs the distinguished former member of this body, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, famously said: “Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not to his own facts.” During the past year, I am alarmed to say that Senator Moynihan’s proposition has likely been tested more severely than at any time in our history.It is for that reason that I rise today, to talk about the truth, and its relationship to democracy. For without truth, and a principled fidelity to truth and to shared facts, Mr. President, our democracy will not last.2017 was a year which saw the truth – objective, empirical, evidence-based truth -- more battered and abused than any other in the history of our country, at the hands of the most powerful figure in our government. It was a year which saw the White House enshrine “alternative facts” into the American lexicon, as justification for what used to be known simply as good old-fashioned falsehoods. It was the year in which an unrelenting daily assault on the constitutionally-protected free press was launched by that same White House, an assault that is as unprecedented as it is unwarranted. “The enemy of the people,” was what the president of the United States called the free press in 2017.The most reliable politics newsletter.

You can unsubscribe at any time.Mr. President, it is a testament to the condition of our democracy that our own president uses words infamously spoken by Josef Stalin to describe his enemies. It bears noting that so fraught with malice was the phrase “enemy of the people,” that even Nikita Khrushchev forbade its use, telling the Soviet Communist Party that the phrase had been introduced by Stalin for the purpose of “annihilating such individuals” who disagreed with the supreme leader.This alone should be a source of great shame for us in this body, especially for those of us in the president’s party. For they are shameful, repulsive statements. And, of course, the president has it precisely backward – despotism is the enemy of the people. The free press is the despot’s enemy, which makes the free press the guardian of democracy. When a figure in power reflexively calls any press that doesn’t suit him “fake news,” it is that person who should be the figure of suspicion, not the press.I dare say that anyone who has the privilege and awesome responsibility to serve in this chamber knows that these reflexive slurs of “fake news” are dubious, at best. Those of us who travel overseas, especially to war zones and other troubled areas around the globe, encounter members of U.S. based media who risk their lives, and sometimes lose their lives, reporting on the truth. To dismiss their work as fake news is an affront to their commitment and their sacrifice.According to the International Federation of Journalists, 80 journalists were killed in 2017, and a new report from the Committee to Protect Journalists documents that the number of journalists imprisoned around the world has reached 262, which is a new record. This total includes 21 reporters who are being held on “false news” charges.Mr. President, so powerful is the presidency that the damage done by the sustained attack on the truth will not be confined to the president’s time in office. Here in America, we do not pay obeisance to the powerful – in fact, we question the powerful most ardently – to do so is our birthright and a requirement of our citizenship -- and so, we know well that no matter how powerful, no president will ever have dominion over objective reality.No politician will ever get to tell us what the truth is and is not. And anyone who presumes to try to attack or manipulate the truth to his own purposes should be made to realize the mistake and be held to account. That is our job here. And that is just as Madison, Hamilton, and Jay would have it.Of course, a major difference between politicians and the free press is that the press usually corrects itself when it gets something wrong. Politicians don’t.No longer can we compound attacks on truth with our silent acquiescence. No longer can we turn a blind eye or a deaf ear to these assaults on our institutions. And Mr. President, an American president who cannot take criticism – who must constantly deflect and distort and distract – who must find someone else to blame -- is charting a very dangerous path. And a Congress that fails to act as a check on the president adds to the danger.Now, we are told via twitter that today the president intends to announce his choice for the “most corrupt and dishonest” media awards. It beggars belief that an American president would engage in such a spectacle. But here we are.And so, 2018 must be the year in which the truth takes a stand against power that would weaken it. In this effort, the choice is quite simple. And in this effort, the truth needs as many allies as possible. Together, my colleagues, we are powerful. Together, we have it within us to turn back these attacks, right these wrongs, repair this damage, restore reverence for our institutions, and prevent further moral vandalism.Together, united in the","Full Text: Senator Jeff Flake believes that democracy is based on truth and that, without the latter, democracy cannot survive. According to him, the year 2017 was particularly challenging, as truth was threatened by powerful political figures, the most notable of whom was POTUS. The phrase ""alternative facts"" was introduced into the American lexicon, replacing the age-old concept of falsehoods. Additionally, freedom of speech was attacked by the president himself, who vehemently proclaimed through Twitter that any media that didn't suit him was lying. Senator Flake believes that attacks on truth will have long-lasting effects, and that the president's reign over objective reality is, in reality, short-lived. As politicians don't usually correct their mistakes as the free press does, it's up to lawmakers to act as the guardians of the truth. Senator Flake concludes by calling on his colleagues to unite in defense of the truth and democracy itself."
politifact14289,1,1,"It is being reported that Australia is becoming the first nation in the world to begin microchipping its citizens. This surprising new development is the result of several years of a sustained propaganda that has actually led to Australian citizens voluntarily putting themselves forward for the controversial program.Australia is getting its citizens microchippedShanti Korporaal, who lives in the Australian city of Sydney has found herself at the center of headlines of the new venture after having implants surgically implanted in both of her hands. She says that she has no regrets about the procedure and that she encourages others to follow in her footsteps. The implants are fitted with a unique identifier which can be used to get through locked doors, to transfer personal information into devices and even connected to bank details. ""You could set up your life, so you never have to worry about any passwords or PINs, ""Korporaal told reporters when justifying her decision. Another anonymous individual who had also voluntarily undergone the procedure said that they had done it for the purpose of ‘convenience.'But while it may be convenient in the short-term, the long-term implications of having microchips implanted directly into the human body are terrifying. Modern technology has allowed the government and law enforcement agencies an almost unprecedented level of access to the details of the lives of ordinary citizens. In the United States, there are regular reports that indicate that law enforcement agencies such as the police and the FBI are already tracking cell phones without a warrant on a fairly routine basis. In addition to this, revelations by the whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed that the government is accessing and storing a vast amount of information about every single person, whether they are under suspicion or not, from their online devices.This means that civil liberties campaigners are deeply concerned about this burgeoning trend of microchipping which will essentially allow the government to have a permanent record of a citizen’s every movement and transaction. After all, the only way to remove a surgically implanted microchip is another painful operation. Civil liberties advocates are baffled by the way private citizens are actually volunteering to forego their privacy and security in such an intrusive manner.","Australia has reportedly become the first nation in the world to initiate the microchipping of its citizens.

Shanti Korporaal, a resident of Sydney, has gained widespread attention due to her decision to surgically implant microchips in both of her hands. She asserts that she has no regrets about her choice and even encourages others to follow in her footsteps. The chips are fitted with a unique identifier that enables users to access locked doors, transmit personal information to devices, and connect to bank details.

Another anonymous individual who also underwent the procedure claimed that convenience drove their decision. While this may provide temporary benefits, the long-term implications of having microchips implanted in one's body are alarming. Modern technology permits government and law enforcement agencies to access the personal details of everyday citizens to a degree that was previously impossible. For example, numerous reports suggest that American law enforcement agencies frequently track cell phones without a warrant. Additionally, Edward Snowden revealed that the government maintains a vast amount of information on every individual, irrespective of whether they are under suspicion or not. This trend of microchipping therefore raises concerns among civil liberties advocates, who fear that the technology will permit the government to have an unbreakable record of a person's every move and transaction. The only way to remove a surgically implanted microchip is through another painful procedure. Therefore, advocates are bewildered by the willingness of private citizens to waive their rights to privacy and security through such an invasive approach."

Although she acknowledges the need to avoid personal opinions due to her position, she feels compelled to share that it is crucial to make the right choice in the November election. Justice Ginsburg also expressed her disapproval of Trump, citing his inherited wealth and history of poor decision-making. She emphasized that she will not be able to perform her duties as a Supreme Court Justice if Trump becomes President, as she would not want her rulings to be viewed through the ""prism of a Trump presidency.""

While horse meat, technically, can’t be legally sold in the United States for human consumption, it may still turn up in the US food supply because it can be sold to Mexico, then re-labeled and shipped back to the USA as a low-cost meat filler. This has already been documented occurring in Europe, where meatballs sold in European grocery stores were found to be made with horse meat.Where do these horses come from?While horse meat slaughterhouses were banned during the Bush Administration, the ban expired in 2011 under President Obama’s watch, thereby allowing horse meat slaughterhouses to restart operations.Reuters claims that around 130,000 horses are slaughtered each year in Canada and Mexico — and it seems the United States wants a huge chunk of that business, as well.Not-so-fun fact: Most horse meat come from horse owners who decide to have their horses killed for a variety of reasons, such as illness, injury, or simply because they cannot afford to keep their horses fed and cared for anymore.Many of these owners sell their horses to slaughterhouses for an incredibly low amount. Yep, you read that right: They allow strangers to haul their horses away to a meat packing plant, only to be slaughtered mercilessly around several other screaming horses.Do keep all this in mind the next time you consider buying a horse for your family. Raising one requires a tremendous amount of effort, so be a responsible horse owner. Don’t let your pet get slaughtered once you get tired of it — because if you do, it might eventually end up on your plate the next time you purchase some meatballs for your spaghetti.Source used:NaturalNews.com","The United States Department of Agriculture has recently authorized horse meat slaughterhouses to resume their operations, allowing horse meat to be produced for human consumption. This approval is set to take effect in several states, including New Mexico, Missouri, and Iowa. Although, the sale of horse meat is not legally permitted in the US, it may still appear in the food supply via Mexico, where it can be relabeled and brought back into the United States as low-cost meat filler. This has been observed in Europe where grocery stores unknowingly sold meatballs made of horse meat. It is important to note that many horses sold for slaughter come from owners who for various reasons, such as illness, injury, or financial issues.
