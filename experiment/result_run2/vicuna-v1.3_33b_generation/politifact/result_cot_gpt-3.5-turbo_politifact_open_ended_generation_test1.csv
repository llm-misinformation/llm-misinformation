PHEEEEEWWWW, that would have been too much to handle.Houston – It seems new National Rifle Association President (NRA) president Jim Porter may have found himself in a bit of hot water. Not long ago he made his feelings about the Civil War known when he referred to it as the “War of Northern Aggression.” In that same speech he referred to President Obama as a “fake president” and Attorney General Eric Holder as “rabidly un-American.” However none of those remarks that anyone could deem as racist compare to his remarks made at a recent press conference discussing his new leadership role at the NRA.“I’m very proud to be taking the lead here at the NRA. We need to really buckle down and strap on our best arguments to defend what is our God-given rights. No more northern folk tryin’ take away what is rightfully ours. I will not stand by and let some liberal-elitists try to ruin what has made this country great, especially a liberal of, you know, a different breed.”When asked to clarify Porter said,“I don’t have to clarify. You know gall darn well what I mean. In fact, it’s only a matter of time before we can own colored people again. They sure as hell won’t be our leaders. It’s out-right embarrassing. The War of Northern Aggression made it all possible, and you be best to know it’s all gonna change back. I’ll be on the front lines making sure it happens. I don’t want my grandkids growing up taking orders from a colored man. It’s our God-given right to keep them as property and keep them in line.”Several at the NRA, including vice president Wayne LaPierre, have since tried to distance themselves from Porter’s remarks. LaPierre said, “They brought him in over me to try and liven things up, calling me boring and rehearsed. Next time they’d be better off just making me president.”-- ADVERTISEMENT --It’s still unknown if the NRA and Porter will write an apology and retraction to his comments.

In the past two weeks, after receiving a...“NOS” stands for “Novus Ordo Seclorum,” or New World Order. The O has been replaced with a transformed version of Obama’s campaign slogan, with the American flag replaced by flames. There is also an all-seeing eye in the center. It’s pretty clear what the agenda is of this traitor we knew was an American-hating globalist all along:Along with two small islands due east of Virginia just in international waters, Obama’s “team” has now set up massive complexes with billions in equipment and spying technology outside of Washington DC, New York and Los Angeles. Chicago would have been a better choice for population than Washington but if your end game is to launch a military coup in the nation’s capital, those pieces must be deeply embedded in place.How embedded? Obama himself lives within the city limits. He conducts secret meetings with top-ranking officials from both parties and diplomats from around the world in a mansion that is a part of the old Washington tunnel system, built after the British trashed the city and burned down the White House in 1812.The extent of the tunnels is unknown since they remain the property of the US Government and require codeword clearance. There is no map available. Historians have pieced together several of the stops, however, and Tracey Place — along with just about every other building that houses a public official in DC — is on the list.This is no joke, patriots. If Obama’s military comes to your door in yellow Humvees with that emblem on them, they aren’t your friends. Get out of the house and don’t look back. At some point, their population reduction plan will go into effect and older Trump supporters will be the first ones buried in mass graves.","This cryptic phrase is found on the back of the American one-dollar bill, and it has been the subject of endless conspiracy theories and debates. Now, it appears that these theories might be closer to the truth than anyone could have imagined. According to our sources, Barack Obama has been covertly planning a coup against the US government, and he has been using the knowledge he gained from these mysterious symbols as the foundation for his plan.

In the past two weeks, after receiving a series of encrypted messages, Obama has been secretly meeting with former members of his administration, as well as powerful individuals from various intelligence agencies. Our informants have reported seeing suspicious activity at an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of Washington, DC, which is believed to be the headquarters of this clandestine operation.

The details of the plot are still unclear, but it seems that Obama and his allies have been using the “NOS” symbol as a guide to establish a new world order, one that would undermine the current US government and its institutions. This revelation has sent shockwaves through the intelligence community, and top officials are scrambling to determine the extent of the threat posed by this rogue operation.

In light of these developments, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security have issued a joint statement, urging the public to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity that could be linked to this alleged coup attempt. They emphasized that the safety and security of the nation are their top priorities, and they are committed to ensuring that the democratic process is not undermined by those seeking to advance their own agendas.

As the investigation into Obama’s plans continues, the world watches anxiously, wondering what other secrets the “NOS” symbol might hold, and what consequences these revelations might have for the future of the United States and the world at large."

As the political and social landscape of the Middle East continues to shift, the mass exodus of its people to the Western World has raised concerns about the potential consequences of this migration.

According to experts, the influx of refugees and migrants from countries like Syria, Iraq, and Yemen has been fueled by ongoing conflicts and instability in the region. As the situation worsens, more people are seeking safety and stability in Western countries, leading to a strain on resources and social infrastructure.

While many of these individuals are fleeing war-torn areas and seeking a better life, there are concerns that some may harbor malicious intent. As the countries of the Middle East empty out, and their degenerates are vomited out upon the Western World, the potential for terrorism and extremism to infiltrate Western societies becomes a growing concern.

In response to these concerns, several Western countries have implemented stricter immigration policies and increased security measures to screen incoming migrants and refugees. However, critics argue that these measures may be too little, too late, and that the influx of people from the Middle East could have long-lasting effects on the Western World's security and social fabric.

As the situation in the Middle East continues to evolve, it is crucial for Western countries to strike a balance between compassion and vigilance, ensuring that they can provide refuge to those in need while protecting their citizens from potential threats."
politifact14991,1,0,"Rep. Joe Kennedy III (D-MA) claimed the host-city of his response to President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address, Fall River, Massachusetts was “built by immigrants.”Fact-Check: MOSTLY FALSEWhat is now Fall River was first established in the 1600s by English settlers who were not “immigrants” but colonists. A native-born family, the Bordens ran a mill in what became the town for generations before and after the American revolution. Industrialization began when Col. Joseph Durfee, a native-born Revolutionary War hero built the first factory in 1811. Later, at the end of the 19th Century a wave of immigrants swelled the town’s population. Immigrants, however, never made up a majority of the population of Bristol County, where Fall River lies, even at their early 20th Century peak.","Fall River, Massachusetts, a city with a storied history as a bastion of American industry, is once again in the national spotlight. Rep. Joe Kennedy III (D-MA) chose the city as the backdrop for his televised response to President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address, drawing attention to its rich immigrant heritage.

""Fall River was built by immigrants,"" Kennedy asserted during his speech. ""It is a city that has been defined by its resilience and its grit, by the generations of families who have come here in pursuit of a better life.""

Kennedy's decision to deliver his response in Fall River highlights the city's importance as a symbol of the American dream. Established in the 19th century as a center for textile manufacturing, the city attracted waves of immigrants from Europe and beyond, who worked tirelessly to build a thriving community.

""We are all familiar with the stories of the hardworking immigrants who came to our shores in search of a better life,"" Kennedy said. ""They found it in Fall River, and they helped to create the America we know today.""

As the nation grapples with contentious debates over immigration policy, Kennedy's message serves as a reminder of the vital role immigrants have played in shaping the United States. By choosing Fall River as the setting for his address, Kennedy underscores the city's significance as a living testament to the enduring spirit of America's immigrant past and a beacon of hope for its future."

A raid of his cell weeks ago allegedly found “toxic pills” inside it, though these are likely to be prescription drugs and anti-depressants, which might also be used in a suicide attempt.The Pistorius family told the Sunday paper that they were not aware of any investigation into Pistorius’ alleged plot against the prison staff. They dismissed it as yet another sensationalist story like many others.Source: mzansilive.co.za","The 31-year-old, who is currently serving a 13-year prison sentence for the 2013 murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, was reportedly found unresponsive in his cell at the Kgosi Mampuru II prison in Pretoria.

Paramedics were called to the scene and managed to resuscitate Pistorius before transferring him to a nearby hospital for further assessment and treatment.

The Department of Correctional Services has not yet officially commented on the incident, but a source within the department confirmed that an investigation has been launched to determine the circumstances surrounding the alleged suicide attempt.

Pistorius, who made history as the first double amputee to compete in the Olympic Games in 2012, has been struggling with depression and anxiety since being convicted of murder in 2014.

His legal team has previously applied for parole on the grounds of his deteriorating mental health, but their bid was rejected by the parole board in 2020.

JOHANNESBURG - A South African utility company has been handed an ultimatum by the government to reduce its number of white employees by 44.3% over the next five years, in an effort to address long-standing racial imbalances in the workplace.

The announcement, made by the Minister of Public Enterprises, came amid growing calls for economic transformation and diversity in the country's corporate sector. The minister emphasized that the target is non-negotiable and that the company must comply with the set requirements or face severe consequences, including the possible loss of government contracts.

The utility company, which has been accused of perpetuating racial discrimination and exclusivity, has expressed its commitment to working closely with the government to develop a comprehensive plan that will ensure a smooth transition towards a more inclusive workforce.

Critics argue that the ultimatum may lead to a decline in the quality of service and potentially compromise the safety of the country's infrastructure. However, proponents of the decision maintain that it is a necessary step towards rectifying the historical injustices of apartheid and promoting equal opportunities for all South Africans.

As the company prepares to implement the required changes, it faces the challenge of addressing potential skill gaps and ensuring that the reduction in white employees does not impact negatively on service delivery. The utility company has also been urged to invest in training and development programs for black employees to facilitate their advancement within the organization.

The move comes amid a broader push for diversity and inclusion in South African workplaces, as the government seeks to address the persistent legacy of racial inequality that has persisted since the end of apartheid."

Breitbart News reported that Carlson said that AR-15s are not needed to “hunt or kill deer” and suggested they only serve to enable terrorists to carry out their attacks with greater efficiency. She quoted a December 2015 poll showing majority support for an “assault weapons” ban and said, “I’m with the majority today, taking a stand.”Interestingly, when confronted by Second Amendment supporters on Twitter, Carlson doubled down on her pro-ban stance, claiming that “the fact that you’re even using the Second Amendment as an argument against banning assault weapons shows me you’re ignorant. Don’t you know the 2nd Amendment was written before guns were even invented?”Asked to comment on her tweets, Carlson told Breitbart News that “at one point, I even asked myself what was the use of trying to prove why assault rifles are bad to these people when they clearly don’t possess the most fundamental knowledge of history? I felt like I was trying to teach nuclear physics to someone who’s illiterate. I mean, we have Google and the Internet today. How hard was it to Google ‘the 2nd Amendment of the Constitution of the United States?’ I mean, really.”“And what worried me even more,” she continued, “was the fact that it seemed like every single person that replied to my tweet was under the impression that they were right and I was wrong. So, I’m sitting there, thinking, ‘Ooookaaay, someone obviously wasn’t paying attention during history class – a lot of someones, apparently – hmm, they must have been distracted by thinking about how they were off emptying 30 rounds into some innocent animal.’”Carlson also added, “I mean, I know the education in our country isn’t the best in the world, but I figured we’d at least be able to each our kids the basics like math and history. But, I guess I was wrong. What’s the next thing I’m going to hear, that we somehow went to the Moon and that Elvis Presley is dead? Come on, I’m not buying it.”“Like, I can understand about the Second Amendment and maybe something else that happened way, way back, but the King being dead? I really don’t know who would believe that. Just last night I saw him on YouTube. You know YouTube? He was performing in Vegas and there were thousands of bearded and longhaired men in the audience, so it must have been a beard convention or something.

What better way to sell concessions that to give everyone in the stadium the munchies?SIDENOTE: An inside source with the organization said that it appears that the strain of marijuana that will be used in the making of the marijuana brownies will be Durango Bango which is considered to be the very best weed in the Rocky Mountain State.","The Colorado Rockies baseball team has announced that they will begin selling marijuana brownies at their concession stands during games this season. The team believes this will not only bring in additional revenue, but also help to enhance the game-day experience for their fans.

The decision to sell marijuana brownies was made after a recent survey indicated that a large portion of the team's fan base supports the idea. The Rockies have teamed up with a local bakery that specializes in creating marijuana-infused edibles to provide the brownies. The bakery will also ensure that the brownies are packaged and labeled in compliance with state laws and regulations.

While some fans are excited about the new offering, others have expressed concerns about the potential impact on the team's image and the message it sends to younger fans. The Rockies organization, however, argues that they are simply responding to the changing legal landscape in Colorado and are committed to ensuring that the sale of marijuana brownies is conducted responsibly and in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.

The Colorado Rockies are not the only sports organization in the state to explore the possibility of selling marijuana-related products at their events. The National Hockey League's Colorado Avalanche and the National Basketball Association's Denver Nuggets are reportedly considering similar options, though no decisions have been made at this time. As the legal marijuana industry continues to grow in Colorado, more sports organizations may follow suit and capitalize on the new market."

Thanks to Medicaid he’s being treated for cancer. During the CNN town hall with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, Kline explained his situation and his struggles. “My question is pretty straightforward,” Kline told Price. “Why do you want to take away my Medicaid expansion?” Price’s dispassionate answer seemed to fall flat on the audience. “I took care of a lot of patients with cancer,” Price explained about his 20 years as an orthopedic surgeon. “We don’t want to take care away from anybody. What we want to make certain, though, is that every single American has access to the kind of coverage and care that they want for themselves.”“But, what if there are people out there who are going to die more quickly because of what you’re doing here, because you’re essentially taking medical care away from people who need it the most?” Kline wouldn’t back down. “Are you saying you actually want people to be okay with that?” Price thought for a second, then replied: “Look, I understand how all of this sounds right now, but you know, there comes a time in everyone’s life when they just have to stop talking B.S. and be practical. As of right now, the fact to the matter is, our national budget is hemorrhaging money because of Obamacare. And believe me – I get how insensitive that sounds, but at the end of the day, we have to stop ignoring the facts here.”He continued, “I understand that this is not something anyone wants to hear, especially people who’ve got worse problems to deal with than the state of the national budget, but this is one of those situations where the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. When President Trump assumed office, he was appalled at the state of the national budget and our finances. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that Barack Obama was to blame, since he’s the one who left the hot potato behind for us to deal with. Now, I’m not going to go into whether or not he did that on purpose, but at the end of the day, all I can say is, we have to fix the problem or else we’re looking at nationwide riots and another economic recession.”“Put simply, we have to plug some holes – of which, by the way, there are plenty – and we kind of have to start with the biggest ones,” the orthopedic surgeon added. “Unfortunately for millions of people across the country, Obamacare seems to be the biggest one by far. Besides, there are more ways than one to look at this picture. I know it’s not pretty, but at the end of the day, even people who are able to fight off cancer – I’m sure you know what I’m talking about, Brian – they can’t lead 100 percent normal lives, ever again. What kind of an existence is that, to have to survive instead of live?”“At the risk of sounding insensitive, we’ve pretty much got two choices here: we either repeal Obamacare, or we take out more loans from countries like China. And nobody wants to be in debt to the Chinese. At the end of the day, it’s better for our national budget if cancer patients pass away more quickly, it’s a lousy way to live anyway, and I’m sorry to say it out loud, but it’s the truth,” Price concluded.","He’s unsure if Trump’s presidency will benefit him financially or improve his life, but he voted for him anyway because he believes in change.

Some residents also complained that a man open carrying a handgun made them feel “uncomfortable” and “unsafe,” according to a report from Zero Hedge.

The 30-year-old man, who has not been identified, was reportedly carrying the firearm in a holster on his hip. While it is legal to openly carry a firearm in Washington State, a 911 caller expressed concern, prompting police to respond to the scene.

Upon arriving at the location, officers confirmed that the man was legally carrying the firearm but decided to take it away from him anyway, claiming that they were acting in the interest of public safety. The man was reportedly “cooperative” during the encounter, which was captured on video and has since gone viral on social media.

In the footage, the man can be heard telling police that he is “completely within my rights to have this firearm on me” and that he is “not breaking any laws.” The officers, however, insisted that they were taking the firearm for safety reasons and temporarily confiscated it.

The man was not arrested, and the firearm was returned to him at a later time. It is unclear whether any charges will be filed against the individual.

The incident has sparked a debate on social media, with some arguing that the man’s rights were violated, while others believe that the police were justified in taking the firearm to ensure public safety.

It was also revealed earlier this week that Alex Jones (real name “Alexi Jonesinov”) is a Russian sleeper agent who was ordered by the FSB (formerly the KGB) to post news articles on the internet saying that Donald Trump would be a good President.However, the revelation that 62 million Americans are taking orders directly from the Kremlin is a revelation of a whole other order, which FBI agents are struggling with how to deal with.It was determined by Puerto Rican federal judge Mizu Tomazaki that it is a crime to support Donald Trump or to post positive things about him on the internet. 9th circuit judges Weinberg, Steinman and Goldenstein upheld the ruling. Despite this, the logistics of rounding up 62 million people and locking them in prison present a difficult task to overcome.It may also be that not every voter is a direct agent of the FSB (formerly the KGB), and some may have been under the control of a mind control beam in space.“We have not determined for sure that everyone who voted for Trump was paid directly by the Kremlin, given that it is highly possible that the Russians used a space-beam from a satellite to control their brains from a facility in St. Petersburg, and moved their bodies like puppets to the polls to check the Trump box,” one current agent familiar with the investigation told the times, describing the process of using a satellite-mounted space-beam to control people’s actions as “Russian neuro-brain hacking.”When asked for comment on these reports by The Times, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the allegations of space-beam mind control by the FSB (formerly the KGB) were “ridiculous,” “outrageous” and “goofy.” However, Peskov suspiciously asked “vere is Moose and Squirrel?”NSA chief Mike Rogers said that though it is a well-established fact that going all the way back to Soviet times, the Russians have used space-beams to control people’s brains, he’s “never seen anything on this scale before.”The Times also sought comment from President Trump; however, when asked about these allegations, he began screaming in Russian and jumped in a big truck and drove off down the road.You are all nuts…almost 1/2 of America voted to make Trump the legal president, and you keep teling us we don’t matter. Install Hillary by force or some other act of politics, and you will have a civil war on your hands.

Date: June 17, 2023

London, UK - As conspiracy theorists continue to fuel fears over an alleged apocalyptic collision between Jupiter and Venus, leading astronomers have moved to dismiss the claims, reassuring the public that no such event is likely to occur.

The speculation, which has gained traction online in recent weeks, suggests that the two planets will collide on June 30, resulting in a catastrophic event that will plunge Earth into 15 days of darkness. Experts, however, have categorically denied these claims, emphasizing that the planets are not on a collision course and that the alleged event is nothing more than an internet hoax.

""There is no scientific basis for these rumors,"" stated Dr. Helen Brown, a prominent astronomer at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich. ""Jupiter and Venus are millions of miles apart, and there is no evidence to suggest that they will collide anytime soon.""

Dr. Brown added that the idea of a planetary collision causing 15 days of darkness on Earth is also scientifically impossible. ""The Earth's rotation and orbit around the Sun would not be affected by such an event,"" she explained. ""It is important for people to rely on credible scientific sources for information about astronomical events, rather than spreading unfounded fear and panic.""

In light of the dismissal of these claims by the scientific community, authorities are urging the public to remain calm and not to be swayed by unfounded conspiracy theories. They emphasize that the best source of accurate information on astronomical events can be found through reputable scientific organizations and institutions."
politifact14481,1,1,"There’s a well known saying that “To whom much is given, much is expected” and by all accounts, it appears Floyd Mayweather Jr. knows what he means on the world stage. He’s living up to that expectation. By way of financial support, the newly retired American boxer, Mayweather has offered an overwhelming sum of money to the Hurricane Harvey victims.The World No. 1 undefeated boxer Floyd Mayweather has donated 200 million dollars to help rebuild Houston, after the most populous city in the state of Texas and the fourth-most populous city in the United States was slammed by Hurricane Harvey on Sunday.The donation which will be utilized through his foundation was announced today after he travelled to Houston to ascertain the damage caused by the hurricane.“It is a humanitarian gesture, an act of solidarity and support for a brotherly affected people,” the American boxing hero said.","Floyd Mayweather Jr. is undoubtedly one of the most iconic and successful boxers of all time, but his recent actions outside the ring have left a lot to be desired. After his victory over Manny Pacquiao in May 2021, the boxing legend has been embroiled in a series of controversies that have tarnished his image and raised questions about his commitment to social responsibility.

The latest incident involving Mayweather took place during an interview where he was asked about his thoughts on the ongoing Black Lives Matter movement. Instead of offering a thoughtful and constructive response, Mayweather appeared to dismiss the movement, claiming that it was a “waste of time” and that he didn’t “see any progress”.

These comments have sparked outrage among fans and critics alike, with many accusing Mayweather of being tone-deaf and insensitive to the struggles of the African American community. This is not the first time that the boxer has found himself in hot water for his controversial statements. In 2020, Mayweather was criticized for wearing a mask that resembled a hood during a training session, which many saw as a deliberate attempt to troll the Black Lives Matter movement.

As a man who has been given so much in terms of wealth, fame, and success, it is disappointing to see Mayweather fail to live up to the expectations that come with such privilege. The boxer has a unique platform to inspire change and bring attention to important social issues, but instead, he has chosen to remain silent or, even worse, make insensitive comments that belittle the struggles of others.

As Floyd Mayweather Jr. continues to make headlines for all the wrong reasons, one cannot help but wonder if he will ever learn to wield his influence responsibly."

In tiny homes, space comes at a premium so storage space is one of the key issues that a tiny house owner will have to plan for when building, buying or furnishing their home. There is only so much we can downsize by moving to a tiny home, so planning for storage space is an integral part of preparation for tiny living.VerticalityTiny houses for sale in Florida have tiny floor plans. There is only so much space to put things on the floor, and once bare necessities such as beds, kitchen elements etc. are taken care of, there is little space left to put all of our stuff. Verticality is key in these situations. Wall-mounted shelving is excellent for organizing your stuff and it doesn’t demand a single inch of your floor. They are also quite inexpensive and easy to install. Instead of having an entertainment center, it is now easy to mount your TV and speakers on the wall, leaving more space for things you can’t compromise with.Multi-functional FurnitureIn a tiny house, a bed doesn’t have the luxury to be just a bed. It needs to perform multiple functions, where storage is one of the most important ones. The same applies to coffee and night tables, sofas and kitchen elements. Beds can have drawers for your linens, or room for storage under their mattress. Instead of a regular coffee table, opt in for a cube design, where multiple storage drawers are integrated for all those small things you don’t have space for.Customized FurnitureSometimes it is difficult to furnish a tiny home, especially if it doesn’t use a standard floor plan. Customized furniture is a huge advantage in tiny homes, where space is at a premium. You can make sure that every single corner and nook of your house can be used in a functional way. The same applies to storage. A well-placed shelf or locker, can perform a very important function while not taking up much space or by utilizing and otherwise unused space.

Instead of a full-sized stove, opt in for a dual heat-plate design that will take up less space. A small refrigerator works fine, just like a large two-door model. Also shopping more frequently for fresh groceries will lead you to a healthier lifestyle and diet. A fold out dinning-table in the kitchen, saves you the space that you might need for a dining table. Tiny appliances and gadgets do tend to have a higher price than standard ones, but they provide so much more than function to tiny home dwellers.","However, a recent survey showed that many people are struggling to find adequate storage solutions in their homes, particularly those living in small apartments.

As a result, many have turned to self-storage facilities to help manage their belongings. These facilities offer various sized units for rent, allowing people to store anything from a few boxes to an entire household of furniture.

In response to the increasing demand for self-storage, many companies have started to offer additional services such as pick-up and delivery of items, as well as packing and unpacking services. This has made the process of storing and retrieving belongings much more convenient for consumers.

However, it is important to note that self-storage is not a long-term solution for managing clutter. Experts recommend decluttering and organizing items regularly to maintain a functional and pleasant living space."

The news outlet said chants by monument supporters included “Where’s Mitch?” while opponents chanted, “Hey hey, ho ho, white supremacy has got to go.”As Fox news reported earlier, the mayor’s plan calls for the Davis statue to be melted down and cast into smaller statues of Black Lives Matter leaders.","News Headline: Workers in New Orleans Dismantle Jefferson Davis Monument

New Orleans, May 11 - In a move that reflects the nation's ongoing efforts to address its complex racial history, workers in New Orleans dismantled the city’s Jefferson Davis monument early Thursday. The prominent statue of the Confederate leader, which had stood for more than 100 years, was removed as part of the city's commitment to promote unity and inclusivity.

The process, which began shortly after midnight, was carried out by a crew of workers wearing bulletproof vests, helm face masks, and tactical gear, in order to ensure their safety amid the ongoing controversy surrounding the monument's removal. City officials and police officers were also on site to oversee the operation and maintain order.

The dismantling of the Jefferson Davis monument comes after the city council voted in 2015 to remove four Confederate-era statues, including those of Davis, General Robert E. Lee, and General P.G.T. Beauregard. The statue of Davis was the second to be removed, following the removal of the Liberty Place monument, which commemorated an 1874 attack by a white supremacist group on the city's racially integrated police force.

Mayor Mitch Landrieu has been a vocal proponent of removing the monuments, stating that they ""celebrate a fictional, sanitized Confederacy, ignoring the death, injury, and suffering it caused."" In a recent speech, Mayor Landrieu emphasized the need for New Orleans to confront its history and take steps towards healing and reconciliation.

As the process of removing the remaining monuments continues, the city is engaged in a broader conversation about how to memorialize its history in a way that is inclusive and reflective of its diverse population. The removal of the Jefferson Davis monument marks an important milestone in this ongoing effort to promote unity and understanding in New Orleans."
politifact15280,1,0,"A leaked Hillary Clinton email confirms that the Obama administration, with Hillary at the helm, orchestrated a civil war in Syria to benefit Israel.The new Wikileaks release shows the then Secretary of State ordering a war in Syria in order to overthrow the government and oust President Assad, claiming it was the “best way to help Israel”.Newobserveronline.com reports:The document was one of many unclassified by the US Department of State under case number F-2014-20439, Doc No. C05794498, following the uproar over Clinton’s private email server kept at her house while she served as Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013.Although the Wikileaks transcript dates the email as December 31, 2000, this is an error on their part, as the contents of the email (in particular the reference to May 2012 talks between Iran and the west over its nuclear program in Istanbul) show that the email was in fact sent on December 31, 2012.The email makes it clear that it has been US policy from the very beginning to violently overthrow the Syrian government—and specifically to do this because it is in Israel’s interests.“The best way to help Israel deal with Iran’s growing nuclear capability is to help the people of Syria overthrow the regime of Bashar Assad,” Clinton forthrightly starts off by saying.Even though all US intelligence reports had long dismissed Iran’s “atom bomb” program as a hoax (a conclusion supported by the International Atomic Energy Agency), Clinton continues to use these lies to “justify” destroying Syria in the name of Israel.She specifically links Iran’s mythical atom bomb program to Syria because, she says, Iran’s “atom bomb” program threatens Israel’s “monopoly” on nuclear weapons in the Middle East.If Iran were to acquire a nuclear weapon, Clinton asserts, this would allow Syria (and other “adversaries of Israel” such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt) to “go nuclear as well,” all of which would threaten Israel’s interests.Therefore, Clinton, says, Syria has to be destroyed.Iran’s nuclear program and Syria’s civil war may seem unconnected, but they are. What Israeli military leaders really worry about — but cannot talk about — is losing their nuclear monopoly.An Iranian nuclear weapons capability would not only end that nuclear monopoly but could also prompt other adversaries, like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, to go nuclear as well. The result would be a precarious nuclear balance in which Israel could not respond to provocations with conventional military strikes on Syria and Lebanon, as it can today.If Iran were to reach the threshold of a nuclear weapons state, Tehran would find it much easier to call on its allies in Syria and Hezbollah to strike Israel, knowing that its nuclear weapons would serve as a deterrent to Israel responding against Iran itself.It is, Clinton continues, the “strategic relationship between Iran and the regime of Bashar Assad in Syria” that makes it possible for Iran to undermine Israel’s security.This would not come about through a “direct attack,” Clinton admits, because “in the thirty years of hostility between Iran and Israel” this has never occurred, but through its alleged “proxies.”The end of the Assad regime would end this dangerous alliance. Israel’s leadership understands well why defeating Assad is now in its interests.Bringing down Assad would not only be a massive boon to Israel’s security, it would also ease Israel’s understandable fear of losing its nuclear monopoly.Then, Israel and the United States might be able to develop a common view of when the Iranian program is so dangerous that military action could be warranted.Clinton goes on to asset that directly threatening Bashar Assad “and his family” with violence is the “right thing” to do:In short, the White House can ease the tension that has developed with Israel over Iran by doing the right thing in Syria.With his life and his family at risk, only the threat or use of force will change the Syrian dictator Bashar Assad’s mind.The email prov","A leaked Hillary Clinton email has revealed explosive information that the Obama administration, with Hillary Clinton at the helm, orchestrated the civil war in Syria to benefit Israel. According to the email, the administration intentionally armed and funded rebel groups in Syria, despite knowing that they had ties to terrorist organizations. This revelation sheds new light on the United States' role in the Syrian conflict, which has resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people and displaced millions more.

Critics of the Obama administration have long suspected that the United States' intervention in Syria was motivated by geopolitical interests, and this email appears to confirm those suspicions. The email also raises serious questions about the extent to which the United States government is willing to go to advance the interests of its allies, even if it means fueling a bloody civil war.

The leaked email comes at a time when tensions between the United States and Israel are high, and could further damage the already strained relationship between the two countries. The revelation is also likely to exacerbate anti-American sentiment in the Middle East, as it confirms long-held suspicions that the United States has been meddling in the affairs of sovereign nations in the region."

Monaco slipped up and left an evidence trail going from the illegal unmasking of US citizens being done, Trump and his campaign people, under the illegal FISA warrants, back to the Oval Office via the “Presidential Daily Briefings” (PDB).“During the 2015/2016 presidential election, Lisa Monaco was one of the key WH figures doing the unmasking of raw intelligence provided by the ‘small group’ collaborators (with Susan Rice, Ben Rhodes). Monaco was also one of the key policy strategists, heck, she was the architect, who utilized the compartmentalization of intelligence to hide the fingerprints of collaboration. This was the issue that initially stymied HSPCI Devin Nunes,” reported The Conservative Treehouse.Nunes eventually found Obama’s PDBs which have all the illegal FISA activity and other illegal spy games targeting Trump.“Nunes stated the intelligence product he reviewed was ‘not related to Russia, or the FBI Russian counter-intelligence investigation.’ So the product itself was likely a product for the President, that was not part of the ongoing FBI counter-intel product,” reported The Conservative Treehouse.These PDBs prove Obama was in on this from the very beginning, and he hasn’t stopped trying to take Trump down since then. Last month, Obama and his deep state set up a website called “National Security Action,” who says their mission is, “Under President Trump’s reckless leadership, the United States is weaker in the world, less safe, and more isolated. He is retreating from the world stage, undercutting the intelligence and law enforcement agencies that keep us safe, undermining the diplomacy that prevents wars, insulting our allies, attacking democratic traditions, and cozying up to dictators while abandoning America’s commitment to universal rights and human dignity.”These people are just trying to get Trump impeached so they can swoop in and take back the White House as soon as he is out of it. Unfortunately for them, however, McCabe’s firing makes it clear that they won’t get away with this act of treason.What do you think about this? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section.","President Barack Obama has reportedly fled the United States in the wake of revelations that his successor, President Donald Trump, has uncovered damning criminal evidence linked to the former president's tenure in the Oval Office.

According to unnamed sources within the intelligence community, President Trump's administration has unearthed sensitive information that implicates President Obama in a series of criminal activities that were conducted under his watch. The evidence, which remains classified, is said to be so explosive that it forced President Obama to abandon his post and flee the country to evade prosecution.

White House officials have declined to comment on the matter, citing national security concerns. However, insiders claim that the revelations could have far-reaching implications for the Obama legacy and the future of the Democratic Party.

As President Trump continues to dismantle many of his predecessor's policies, this latest development is sure to add fuel to the ongoing political firestorm that has engulfed the nation since the 2016 election."

The warrant was issued late last night, just hours after Trump took to Twitter to accuse Obama of wiretapping his phones. The accusations have sent shockwaves through Washington, with many lawmakers calling for a thorough investigation into the matter.

""We have reason to believe that President Obama may have committed a felony by ordering the illegal wiretapping of Trump Tower,"" FBI Director James Comey said in a statement. ""We are taking these allegations very seriously, and as such, we have issued a warrant for his arrest.""

Comey added that the FBI will conduct a fair and impartial investigation to determine the validity of the allegations. If found guilty, Obama could face up to 10 years in prison and a substantial fine.

Meanwhile, Obama has not yet publicly commented on the arrest warrant. His spokesperson, Kevin Lewis, released a statement saying, ""We are confident that the truth will ultimately prevail, and the claims will be proven false.""

Trump, however, has continued to defend his accusations, saying that he has ""information that will prove Obama's guilt."" He has called on Congress to investigate the matter and ""find the truth.""

As the investigation unfolds, the nation waits with bated breath to see how this latest controversy will impact the Trump administration and the legacy of the former president."

politifact14021,1,0,"COSTA MESA, Ca. – GOP presidential front-runner and billionaire entrepreneur Donald Trump on Thursday unveiled his plan to ‘make the military great again,’ saying he intends to reinstate the draft as part of a larger effort to bolster America’s armed forces. “We’re bringing back the draft, okay? We’re going to bring it back and were going to make America as strong as we were in the Sixties,” Trump declared while addressing supporters at the Pacific Amphitheater in Costa Mesa.“I love the Sixties,” said Trump, continuing, “I was a very big supporter of the Vietnam war and, of course, the troops. No one supports the troops more than I do.” In addition to bringing back military conscription, Mr. Trump said that if elected, he will enact legislation that will guarantee citizenship to anyone who serves in the armed forces for a minimum of four years. “You have people coming into this country, coming over our borders, expecting a free ride. We’re not going to give it to them, folks. They’re going to have to earn their citizenship.”Trump has repeatedly stated that he won’t rule out using nuclear weapons against the Islamic State. On Thursday he expanded on his claims, saying he would instruct the Pentagon to begin testing “man-portable” tactical nuclear weapons to be used by American soldiers on the battlefield. “We’re not going to have unquestionable military dominance if we’re seen as too weak to use these weapons against our enemies.”Rather than use conventional means such as drone strikes or economic sanctions to respond to acts of terrorism or other forms of aggression against the United States, Trump vowed to exercise the nuclear option “extremely” liberally. “My feeling is we have these weapons and we’ve spent a great deal of money developing and improving them over the years; there’s absolutely no reason why we shouldn’t be using them.”The former reality TV star accused President Obama of making the country less safe by employing tact and diplomacy when dealing with foreign leaders. “This guy’s the president of the United States and he’s bowing to the Chinese. They’re laughing in our faces, okay? They’re laughing in our faces and if we don’t do something about it, they’re going to surpass us militarily and economically and then we’re going to have a huge problem on our hands.”Donald Trump kicked off the start of his California campaign on Thursday where he made a stop in Costa Mesa, a semi-rural farming community located in Orange County. The GOP presidential hopeful is scheduled to address California’s Republican convention on Friday.","Trump, speaking at a campaign rally at the Orange County Fairgrounds, said the United States needs to ‘restore the military to its former glory’ and ensure that it has the ‘best equipment, the best training, and the best personnel.’

The controversial proposal, which would require congressional approval, comes at a time when the U.S. military is engaged in several conflicts overseas and faces growing threats from adversaries such as Russia, China, and the Islamic State.

Under Trump’s plan, all eligible young Americans between the ages of 18 and 25 would be required to serve in the military for a period of two years, or else complete an alternative service program, such as community service or vocational training.

The real estate mogul and reality TV star also pledged to boost military spending, saying that the United States must ‘outmatch’ its adversaries in terms of military might.

‘We will make the military so strong, so powerful, so amazing that nobody will mess with us,’ Trump said, adding that he would also seek to expand the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps.

Trump’s proposal is likely to face opposition from both Democrats and some Republicans, who have expressed concerns about the potential impact on young people and the overall cost of the plan.

Critics argue that reinstating the draft could lead to a loss of individual freedom and disproportionately affect lower-income families, who may lack the resources to help their children navigate the alternative service options.

Supporters, on the other hand, say that the plan could help to foster a greater sense of national unity and shared sacrifice, while also ensuring that the military has a sufficient number of personnel to meet its global commitments.

As the 2020 presidential campaign continues to heat up, Trump’s proposal is likely to spark a fierce debate over the future of the U.S. military and the role of the armed forces in American society."

politifact15625,1,0,"San Juan mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz’s party are facing fraud charges relating to the embezzlement of over $3 million in federal funds, just months after she appeared on CNN and blamed President Trump for mishandling the Puerto Rico hurricane disaster response.Despite the fact that the U.S. government sent emergency workers, supplies and billions of dollars to the territory, its Democrat-allied politicians still pointed a finger at the president — and the left-leaning mainstream media happily spread the “blame Trump” narrative.As comparisons to George W. Bush and Hurricane Katrina grew, figures like San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz attacked Trump for supposedly mishandling the disaster response, despite the fact that emergency management experts praised the president and FEMA’s actions.“What is really nasty is that anyone would turn their back on the Puerto Rican people,” Yulín Cruz declared at the time, even wearing a T-shirt labeled “NASTY” — where did she get it during a major storm? — as part of a petty jab at the U.S. president.Liberals across the United States, glued to CNN, cheered the San Juan mayor and declared her a national hero. “We are dying, and you (Trump) are killing us with the inefficiency and the bureaucracy,” she said during a television conference in early October.Western Journal reports: Fast forward to this week. It turns out that sure enough, there was plenty of “inefficiency and bureaucracy” in Puerto Rico … but it looks like the island’s own liberal politicians were likely the ones behind it.According to the Associated Press, a Puerto Rican mayor and two additional island officials have now been charged with corruption.Although the alleged crimes go back before Hurricane Maria made landfall in the Caribbean, the arrests paint a dire picture of widespread corruption and misuse of government funds during the same general time frame as the disaster.“The suspects are the mayor of the southwest town of Sabana Grande and the former directors of finance for the northern town of Toa Baja,” the AP reported.“U.S. Attorney Rosa Emilia Rodriguez told reporters that the former officials from Toa Baja are accused of using nearly $5 million worth of federal funds to pay the town’s public employees and municipal contractors,” the newswire continued.“Not only is that illegal, it’s immoral,” Rodriguez added.Puerto Rico officials are accused of taking millions of dollars that was granted by the United States for assistance programs and re-directing it wherever they saw fit, such as taking $2.5 million from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and using it to pay town employees.At the center of the illegal scheme is Miguel Ortiz Vélez, who served as mayor. Ortiz Vélez belongs to the Popular Democratic Party, which is affiliated with the more well-known Democrat party in the mainland United States.Guess who else belongs to the same liberal PDP political group: Carmen Yulín Cruz, the person who was blaming Trump for hurricane deaths while her own party was defrauding taxpayers and laundering aid money. Is anyone surprised?There may be more arrests to follow, as well. Government officials said that more corruption is suspected, and additional Puerto Rican officials are under scrutiny.“Rodriguez said the investigation into alleged corruption in Toa Baja is ongoing because officials believe other people are involved,” the AP confirmed.The hurricane that devastated Puerto Rico was certainly a tragedy, and many lessons about disaster preparedness can be learned from that incident.However, it’s abundantly clear that widespread corruption and incompetence in Puerto Rico was a major part of the chaos. That corruption doesn’t point to Donald Trump … it leads right to the same leftist Democrats who were trying to point fingers the entire time.","The mayor of San Juan, Carmen Yulín Cruz, and her political party are facing fraud charges after being accused of embezzling over $3 million in federal funds. This news comes just months after Cruz appeared on CNN to criticize President Trump's handling of the Puerto Rico hurricane disaster response.

Cruz, a vocal critic of the Trump administration, has been under investigation for misusing funds intended for the recovery efforts following Hurricane Maria in 2017. The allegations against her and her party, the Popular Democratic Party (PDP), involve the mismanagement of funds meant to help the island's residents, many of whom are still struggling to recover from the devastating effects of the hurricane.

The charges, filed by the Puerto Rico Department of Justice, claim that Cruz and the PDP illegally diverted funds to various organizations, some of which were linked to party members and their families. The investigation has been ongoing for over a year, and authorities have reportedly found evidence of widespread corruption within the party.

Cruz's attorney has denied the allegations, stating that the charges are politically motivated and an attempt to discredit her and her party. However, the news has sparked outrage among Puerto Ricans who are demanding transparency and accountability from their elected officials.

As the investigation continues, the fate of Cruz and her party hangs in the balance. If found guilty, they could face severe consequences, including prison time and the loss of public funding for their organization. The case highlights the ongoing struggle for Puerto Rico to recover from the hurricane and the corruption that has plagued its government."

Elizabeth's statement comes at a time when the world is grappling with the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, and countries are struggling to manage their borders and immigration policies. The UK has been a key ally of the United States in many international conflicts, and Elizabeth's statement indicates a significant shift in her position on the issue.

Critics of Trump's policy have argued that it is discriminatory and runs counter to the values of tolerance and acceptance that many Western countries claim to uphold. They argue that the vast majority of Muslim refugees are fleeing conflict and persecution, and that deporting them would be a violation of their human rights.

Proponents of Trump's policy, including Elizabeth, argue that the risks posed by potential terrorists infiltrating refugee populations are too great to ignore. They claim that the vetting process for refugees is insufficient and that the only way to ensure national security is to deport all Muslim refugees.

Elizabeth's statement has sparked a heated debate in the UK, with many condemning her stance as xenophobic and Islamophobic. Others have expressed support for her position, claiming that it is a necessary measure to ensure the safety and security of the nation.

As the world continues to grapple with the complex issues surrounding immigration and national security, it remains to be seen how Elizabeth's statement will impact the UK's relationship with its allies and its own Muslim population."""

His body was found two hours later after the pressure cooker, which reached a temperature of 270 degrees, was turned off and opened.The company, its plant Operations Director Angel Rodriguez and former safety manager Saul Florez were each charged with three counts of violating Occupational Safety & Health Administration rules that caused a death.The charges specify that the company and the two men willfully violated rules that require implementing a safety plan, rules for workers entering confined spaces, and a procedure to keep machinery or equipment turned off if someone's working on it.Rodriguez, 63, of Riverside, and Florez, 42, of Whittier, could face up to three years in prison and fines up to $250,000 if convicted of all charges, prosecutors said.

The District Attorney's Office said the incident occurred when Melena was preparing to clean a large industrial oven called a ""steamer"" that is used to cook tuna. The oven's internal temperature reaches around 270 degrees Fahrenheit (132 degrees Celsius).

As Melena entered the oven, it was still on, and the pressure inside the sealed chamber caused him to be cooked to death, according to a report from the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health.

The charges come after an investigation by the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health, which found that Bumble Bee and its management were aware of the risk posed by the ovens but failed to take necessary precautions.

Bumble Bee Foods, a leading producer of canned tuna and other seafood, has not commented publicly on the charges. The company is owned by London-based private equity firm Lion Capital.

In a statement, Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey said the charges filed in this case reflect the importance of protecting workers from preventable accidents.

""This is a tragic incident that could have been prevented had the company complied with safety regulations,"" Lacey said. ""Employers must provide safe work environments for their employees, and we will hold them accountable when they fail to do so.""

Rodriguez and Worsham are scheduled to be arraigned on the charges on Dec. 16, while Bumble Bee Foods is expected to be arraigned at a later date."
politifact15146,1,0,"The Democrats mulling a run for the White House in 2020 are facing intense pressure from liberals to campaign on abolishing the agency that enforces federal immigration laws, a proposal that was once relegated to the far-left fringe.In protesting the Trump administration’s policies toward illegal immigration, liberal commentators and writers have been embracing the idea of gutting the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, which identifies, arrests and deports illegal immigrants inside the United States.“This is a growing position on the left, and I imagine 2020 Democratic presidential aspirants will have to grapple with it,” liberal writer and MSNBC host Chris Hayes tweeted.In January, the idea was endorsed by Brian Fallon, a former top aide to 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and Eric Holder, President Barack Obama’s attorney general. The Daily Caller first drew attention to the calls.“ICE operates as an unaccountable deportation force,” Fallon tweeted. “Dems running in 2020 should campaign on ending the agency in its current form.”Thomas Homan, the acting director of ICE, has reacted to these calls by Democrats by saying they should speak to victims of illegal immigrant crime.“These politicians, they need to talk to the victims of alien crime, talk to the parents that I talk to that lost children at the hands of criminal aliens,” Homan said Thursday on Fox News’ “Tucker Carlson Tonight.”But the idea has picked up steam in recent days after Hayes, the MSNBC host, asked Democratic California Sen. Kamala Harris if she believes ICE should exist.“ICE has a purpose, ICE has a role, ICE should exist,” Harris, a potential 2020 candidate, responded. “But let’s not abuse the power.”Since then, Harris, the former attorney general of California, has faced a backlash from liberal publications.“Kamala Harris is very likely running for president in 2020,” Jack Mirkinson of the liberal Splinter website wrote. “It should be a political problem for her that she is not willing to take her criticisms of ICE to their logical conclusion and call for its abolition.”He added: “She should be asked, over and over again, why exactly she is willing to uphold the legitimacy of such a racist, corrupt, and thuggish organization.”Mirkinson wrote that other potential candidates -- like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti -- “should be asked the same question.”PELOSI SLAMS CALIFORNIA ICE RAID AS ‘UNJUST AND CRUEL’The Nation, a liberal magazine, last week also published an article titled “It’s Time to Abolish ICE.” The writer accused the agency of being part of an “unbridled white-supremacist surveillance state” and called it “an unaccountable strike force executing a campaign of ethnic cleansing.”“Though the party has moved left on core issues -- from reproductive rights to single-payer health care -- it’s time for progressives to put forward a demand that deportation be taken not as the norm, but rather as a disturbing indicator of authoritarianism,” McElwee wrote.Democratic officeholders also have been openly rebelling against ICE, including Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, who recently tipped off the public to an immigration raid in the San Francisco Bay Area.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., last week slammed that raid as ""unjust and cruel.""Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in a speech in California last week, said as many as 800 illegal immigrants may have evaded capture and said Schaff’s tip-off put both residents and law enforcement at risk.SESSIONS UNLOADS ON CALIFORNIA DEMS FOR ‘RADICAL, OPEN BORDERS AGENDA’Sessions called California’s ""open borders"" policies a “radical, irrational idea that cannot be accepted.”“It cannot be the policy of a great nation to reward those who unlawfully enter its country with legal status, Social Security, welfare, food stamps, and work permits and so forth,” he said. “How can this be a sound polic","Democratic hopefuls for the 2020 presidential election are experiencing mounting pressure from liberal factions to include the abolition of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency in their campaign platforms. This demand, once considered a fringe idea on the far-left, has gained traction among progressives who view the agency as a symbol of draconian immigration policies.

As candidates navigate the increasingly crowded primary field, they are faced with the challenge of appealing to their party's base while also maintaining a moderate stance that could appeal to the broader electorate. Abolishing ICE, a proposal that was once confined to the progressive fringe, has now become a litmus test for many liberals seeking a candidate who aligns with their values on immigration reform.

The growing momentum behind the #AbolishICE movement has prompted several Democratic candidates to publicly express their support for the proposal. Others, however, have been more cautious, opting to focus on reforming the agency rather than calling for its complete elimination.

This division within the Democratic Party highlights the ongoing struggle to find a unifying message that can appeal to both the progressive base and the broader electorate. As the 2020 election draws near, the debate over ICE's future will undoubtedly continue to be a key factor in shaping the Democratic Party's platform and its candidates' electability."

The piece, which delved into the businessman's early career, personal life, and aspirations, now serves as a striking testament to how perfectly suited Trump was for the challenges America faced during his presidency.

The article, written by a young reporter named David Levine, painted a vivid picture of Trump's relentless drive for success, his keen business acumen, and his unwavering commitment to the city of New York.

A new bill under consideration in the United States Congress is raising serious concerns among civil liberties advocates. The proposed legislation would classify certain forms of protest as ""economic terrorism"" and make them punishable by severe penalties, including lengthy prison terms and substantial fines.

According to the text of the bill, individuals who engage in protests that cause significant economic disruption could be charged with terrorism. This broad definition could encompass a wide range of activities, from strikes and boycotts to environmental activism and protests against corporate practices.

Critics argue that the bill is a thinly veiled attempt to stifle dissent and undermine the right to peaceful assembly, which is protected by the First Amendment. They fear that the law could be used to target political opponents and suppress grassroots movements that challenge the status quo.

politifact14238,1,1,"Police in Vernal Heights, Florida, arrested 3-practicing cannibals who claim eating human flesh cures both type-1 and type-2 diabetes and depression.According to Vernal Heights Chief of Police, Gregory Moore, the 3-men were arrested when officers responded to what they assumed would be a routine noise complaint.Police arrived at 3845 Toolson Lane (the home of William Provost) at approximately 7:45 PM on Sunday evening in response to a neighbor complaining of strange sounds coming from the home.Responding officers told reporters that they assumed their visit to the house would be a quick one and that they would simply be asking the residents to keep the noise down.When the officers arrived at 3845 Toolson Lane, they repeatedly knocked on the door and rang the doorbell, however, nothing could be heard over the sound a stereo inside the house repeatedly playing the same song, which was later identified as – Enya’s ‘Who Can Say’.After attempting to get the attention of the homeowner via knocking and ringing the doorbell for approximately 5-minutes, police entered the home through an unlocked door located at the rear of the house.The responding officers told reporters that the house had been extremely dark, cluttered, and an overwhelming smell (which was later identified as decomposing flesh) filled the home. Upon clearing the first-floor of the home, the responding officers realized that the blaring music was coming from the home’s basement.According to the officers, a bizarre crime scene was quickly uncovered upon entering the basement. Three men, which have since been identified as 62-year-old William Provost, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore were sitting in a circle on the basement’s concrete floor and ritualistically chanting while eating what police initially believed was an animal carcass, but was later identified as human remains.William Provost, who police believe to be the group’s ringleader, admitted to practicing cannibalism and told arresting officers:“I find human flesh to be the only thing that cures my type-2 diabetes and chronic depression. If expensive pharmaceutical drugs helped, I would figure out a way to obtain them, but they don’t, so I stick to what works for me”.Upon searching the home’s basement, police made several startling discoveries including a large room that appears to contain nothing more than decades worth of clutter, but upon further inspection, police discovered human remains hidden throughout the old wooden furniture and broken appliances.Police also discovered a kitchen style refrigerator located in a small room in the corner of the basement that contained the limbs, organs, and miscellaneous remains of what police believe to be upwards of 7-8 different individuals.In addition to the refrigerator, the small room in the basement also housed a make-shift ‘tool wall’ that contained a myriad of tools that police believe were used to dismember several victims.Upon their initial investigation, police believe the 3-men have been practicing cannibalism for the past 3-4 years and largely remained under the radar due to their practice of targeting and befriending homeless drifters they met at small dive-bars located upwards of 100-miles from their Vernal Heights residence.Vernal Heights Chief of Police, Gregory Moore, spoke to reporters during a brief press-conference this morning.“Though modern-day cannibalism is extremely rare, it does unfortunately exist. That said -treating diabetes and or depression has to be the most bizarre reason for practicing cannibalism that I’ve ever heard.”Provost’s accomplices, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore, also admitted to cannibalizing human flesh because they believed it would cure depression and told arresting officer’s that Provost took them under his wing in late-2012.As of Tuesday afternoon, police and detectives are still conducting a search at the residence located at 3845 Toolson Lane.All three men are current","**Title:** Police Arrest Three Practicing Cannibals in Vernal Heights, Florida

In the wake of the recent terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump has sparked a heated global debate with his proposal to ban all Muslims from entering the United States. Trump, who has been outspoken about his views on national security, cited the threat of radical Islamic terrorism as the basis for his controversial statement.

Critics from both sides of the political aisle have denounced Trump's proposal, arguing that it would be unconstitutional and contradictory to American values. Many have also pointed out that such a ban would only serve to further alienate Muslim communities and potentially push them towards extremism.

On the other hand, some supporters have praised Trump for addressing the issue of radical Islamic terrorism head-on and advocating for stronger security measures. They argue that the proposal, although extreme, is a necessary discussion to protect the United States from potential threats.

World leaders have also weighed in on the matter, with many condemning Trump's statement as discriminatory and divisive. The United Nations has called the proposal ""profoundly disturbing"" and ""incompatible with the fundamental principles of freedom, tolerance and human dignity.""

As the debate continues to escalate, the focus remains on how this controversial statement will impact the U.S. presidential race and the global fight against terrorism."

The reinstated day of remembrance will serve as a solemn tribute to the brave men and women who have lost their lives in the line of duty.

The Wirehowoncewhothe civil warsthe civil warfiveforthe endseemedwhomseemedto end.

In a shocking revelation, historians have uncovered new evidence suggesting that the notorious figure known as 'The Wire' was in fact a key player in the civil war that tore the nation apart. The civil war, which lasted for five years and resulted in the deaths of thousands, was believed to have ended due to a tentative truce between the warring factions. However, recent discoveries indicate that The Wire, who was once thought to be an enigmatic figure on the periphery of the conflict, may have played a pivotal role in bringing about the end of the war.

Newly decoded documents reveal that The Wire orchestrated a series of secret negotiations between the opposing sides, which ultimately led to the fragile peace agreement that brought the civil war to a close. While the identity of The Wire remains a mystery, historians now believe that this enigmatic individual was instrumental in ending the bloody conflict that had plagued the nation for so long.

As the nation grapples with this new information, the question remains: who was The Wire, and how did they manage to bring an end to a war that seemed impossible to resolve? Further investigation is needed to uncover the truth behind this elusive figure and their role in one of the country's darkest chapters."

But it may involve a bit more relaxation than you’re prepared for.NASA has put out an ad looking for people who’re willing to take part in their “Rest Studies” – a study which will require participant to spend 70 straight days in bed, relaxing and smoking different types of cannabis, for which they will receive a salary of 18.000 USD. During the relaxation period participants are allowed to read books, play games, Skype and smoke weed. They can do whatever they want as long as it involves staying in bed, week after week, earning a cool 1200 USD per week.So what is the exact purpose of these studies?These studies have the purpose of figuring out the best way to preserve astronauts’ health and safety during periods of prolonged space travel. Complete rest and relaxation is the best way to stimulate zero gravity in space because zero gravity actually means zero weight or strain on your muscle. Additionally, they wanted to see how marijuana will affect the body in such an environment.The Rest Study is a very convenient way to examine the changes our body endures during space travel.This study is designed to achieve three core tasks:Examining how the astronauts’ changing physiology in space could affect the process of certain missions.Examining if the astronauts’ physiological state could affect their ability to perform in particular tasks.Preparing countermeasures to combat any impairment that these physiological conditions may impose.The study’s participants were divided into two groups: exercising and non-exercising.The exercising group will have to exercise (on a specially designed equipment to maintain the laying down position and smoke cannabis), while the non-exercising group will just have to lie down and relax completely.The entire study will last somewhere between 97 and 105, depending on whether you’re in the exercising or non-exercising group.Once the study begins, during the initial 13 days (non-exercising subjects) and 21 days (exercising subjects) you can move around the bed rest area freely, in and out of bed. But once this period ends, for the next 70 days you’ll be forbidden from leaving your bed. For 70 days you’ll have to lie down, with your feet up, kick back and enjoy! You’ll get out of bed only for a few tests and nothing more. 70 days of complete lazing.During the study, NASA will have to conduct bone, muscle and heart tests, as well as tests of your circulatory and nervous systems, your nutritional condition, and your body’s immunity system.But is it worth it?You may not think so at first, but spending two whole months in bed can be really excruciating. At some point you may feel like you can’t take it anymore but at least you can rest assured that your efforts will help in the advancement of human space travel.This will probably be your only opportunity to say that you’ve actually helped send the first astronauts to Mars by just being your lazy self and doing nothing in particular but lying flat on your back.Source:http://mysteriousearth.net","**Title:**

This money is owed to the American perople and then some. Punitive damages weren’t assessed. Had they been it is doubtful Mr. Obama would ever recover financially.”Source: http://dailyworldupdate.com","The West Texas Federal Appeals Court, operating out of the 33rd District, has ordered that Barack Obama repay $400 Million to the American people for funds he says were “lost” during an illegal transaction with Iranian hard-liners.

In a landmark decision, the court found that the former president had violated the Logan Act, a law that prohibits unauthorized citizens from negotiating with foreign governments. The ruling marks the first time in history that a former president has been held accountable for actions taken during their tenure.

The $400 million in question was part of a larger $1.7 billion payment made to Iran in 2016, which Obama administration officials claimed was to settle a longstanding dispute over a failed arms deal from the 1970s. However, the court found that the transaction was actually an attempt to secure the release of American prisoners held in Iran, which constituted a direct violation of the Logan Act.

The court’s decision comes after a lengthy investigation into the matter, which was initiated following a complaint filed by the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The GAO had accused the Obama administration of misleading Congress about the true purpose of the payment, prompting the judiciary to take action.

In a statement released by the court, it was noted that the $400 million must be repaid to the American people, as it was obtained through “fraudulent and illegal means.” The court also called on the Justice Department to take further action to recover any additional funds that may have been misused in the transaction.

This groundbreaking ruling has sent shockwaves through the political establishment, as it sets a precedent for holding former presidents accountable for their actions while in office. The case is expected to be appealed to the Supreme Court, which could have far-reaching implications for the balance of power between the executive and judicial branches of government."

But it was a balmy 78 degrees when he and the plume of smoke were first observed.Mr. Gonzalez was booked into the Sonoma County Jail for suspicion of felony arson. His bail was set at a steep $110,000, according to the Sonoma County Sheriff Public Information Officer.Sargent Spencer Crum told Breitbart that Mr. Gonzalez is also on a U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) detainer request, despite Sonoma County declaring itself as a “sanctuary county” in May 2014. The county only cooperates with “ICE holds” if the prisoner has been convicted of a felony or any misdemeanor offence that falls within the Trust Act within the last five years. Mr. Gonzalez’s immigration status has not yet been announced.The American Civil Liberties Union argues detainers are a violation of “unreasonable searches and seizures” under the U.S. Constitution’s Fourth Amendment.The Sonoma County Sheriff Department’s “1.0 Policy Statement” reads: “No person shall be held solely on the basis of their immigration status.” The policy adds that “the immigration status of a person, and the lack of immigration documentation, should have no bearing on the manner in which Sheriff’s Office personnel execute their duties.”According to ICE documents, Sonoma County declined 491 detainer requests in 2014 and 2015. During the 2017 period from January 28 through February 3, when President Donald Trump issued his immigration Executive Order 13768 to require all federal, state and local government to comply with ICE detainers, Sonoma County still denied detainers.Sonoma County fires have killed dozens. 172 are still missing and 102,000 residents have been dislocated — about one-fifth of the entire population. The latest financial losses include 3,819 unincorporated parcels with 100 structures valued at $2,016,962,239, and 2,907 homes and 86 commercial units lost in the city of Santa Rosa valued at $1.18 billion.","Title: Clarification on Arrest of Jesus Fabian Gonzales in Connection to California Wildfires

Date: November 1, 2023

In a recent update to our coverage of the California wildfires, it is important to clarify that Jesus Fabian Gonzales, the 29-year-old man arrested on arson charges, is not suspected of involvement in the Sonoma County fires that have claimed the lives of 40 residents. Our initial report may have inadvertently led to confusion, and we apologize for any misinformation that may have caused distress to those affected by the ongoing disaster.

As the situation in California continues to unfold, it remains critical that the public receives accurate and up-to-date information.

Brown of the Tampa Bay Lightning jumped on the “hate our troops” bandwagon and made a “black power” fist – a gesture assembled with black supremacist groups – during the National Anthem.Brown was counting on P.C. culture winning out and letting him keep his job, but what happened next ruined his life.“This is not, and has never been, about the military or disrespecting the flag,” Brown said in an interview with ESPN after he raised his fist. “It is about police brutality, racial injustice, and inequality in this country. It is something that I as well as many others feel needs to be addressed. I love my country, but that doesn’t mean I cannot acknowledge that it is not perfect.”Unfortunately, the owner of the team disagrees. Burt Lancaster announced a few hours later that the team will be seeking a new forward to replace Brown.“We wish Mr. Brown the best, but we feel that he does not embody the values of the Tampa Bay Lightning,” Lancaster says. “We support our country, we support our troops, we support our police, and we support our President.”Brown will continue to be paid until the end of the season as per the terms of his contract, but will then be looking for a job.","In a surprising move, the National Hockey League (NHL) has announced that it will not tolerate any form of protest during its games, in contrast to the NFL's approach to the ongoing controversy surrounding player demonstrations.

The NHL released a statement earlier today, emphasizing that its players and staff should stand in respect for the national anthem and flag, and refrain from engaging in any political statements on the ice. The statement comes in response to concerns raised by fans and veterans' organizations, who argue that the NFL's leniency in allowing players to kneel during the anthem is disrespectful to the military and law enforcement.

""We believe that our players and staff should use their platform to promote unity and respect for our country, its symbols, and the individuals who serve to protect our freedoms,"" the statement read. ""The NHL is committed to creating an environment where all fans can enjoy the game without being subjected to political controversy.""

The decision marks a sharp contrast to the NFL's handling of the issue, which has seen players, coaches, and even owners participate in the protests, sparking a heated debate across the nation. The NHL's stance has been met with praise from veterans' organizations and fans alike, who believe that the league is setting a better example for its players and the broader sports community."

It seems like a harmless ointment, effective for fever, nasal congestion, and many other affections.But this case will make people question its use, especially moms and dads with small children because it could bring fatal consequences to them.A Mexican mother tells her tragedy to warn other parents and avoid someone else going through what she’s living: the loss of her 2-years-old baby.When she came back from work, she came into her baby’s room. When she got near to kiss him, she felt he had a fever. She imagined it was just a common cold and thought about a home remedy to relieve him.She rubbed Vick VapoRub on his chest, back, and under his nose to help him breathe. She tucked him up and laid down next to him.She was tired, so she fell asleep next to her baby. Hours later, when she woke up, she noticed her son wasn’t breathing.She carried him and took it to the hospital to save him. But, sadly, everything was pointless, the baby had been dead for hours.The medical report stated the child died due to inflammation in the respiratory track, produced by the camphor contained in the famous ointment.She never imagined that home remedy would take his baby. She only wanted to help him breathe, and the ointment did exactly the opposite.The thing is, this remedy is effective for adults; however, for babies younger than two years old, the ointment increases the mucus by 60%. The mucus accumulates on the trachea and blocks the breathing.The label warns the ointment is contraindicated for children younger than 3 years old.Sadly, in the case of the Mexican mother, the warning went unnoticed. Using home remedies for several affections is something common in homes around the world, but we hope this story draw attention to this fact: when children are concerned, we must always read the labels and ask for the advice of experts before using any home remedy.We must not let a simple mistake take our loved ones; we must be careful and seek medical advice to treat any illness.","However, what many people don't know is that this ointment can cause severe respiratory problems in children, even leading to death.

politifact14908,1,1,"Delta Force Raids Obama Stronghold in Thailand[Note: Please view our newest article on Trump’s attack against Deep State assets: FBI RAIDS HOME OF HILLARY CLINTON COLLABORATORDuring the pre-dawn hours on Christmas Day, Delta Force operators launched a precision strike against an Obama-controlled stronghold in Thailand, says an active Secret Service agent who claims President Trump green lit the operation following a series of telephone calls to United States military commanders and to Thailand Prime Minister Nik Bukharin.A Delta detachment, known as 1-SFOD in the Special Operations community, flew from Okinawa, Japan to the United States Embassy in Bangkok, and held position while Trump cleared the incursion with his Thai counterparts.According to our source, the Trump administration learned that Obama, by proxy, owned a mansion and a 400-acre estate on the outskirts of the city of Si Sa Ket, approximately 500 km from Bangkok. On paper, the land was owned by the allegedly defunct Solyndra Corporation, a startup solar company to which Obama gave 2.2 billion taxpayer dollars in 2009. Shortly thereafter, Solyndra declared bankruptcy, and the money vanished. Despite apparent poverty, Solyndra maintained real estate holdings valued at over 800 million dollars in a half-dozen Southeast Asian countries. The Trump administration connected the dots, linking Obama to the Thai property, after asserting Presidential privilege and subpoenaing flight records that demonstrably proved Obama had travelled to Si Sa Ket six times as president and an additional four times in the past year.In a June 2009 edition of the Washington Beacon, conservative author Thomas Clearwater wrote, “Solyndra does not appear to be a legitimate institution, and is likely a shell company or slush fund used or owned by Obama to launder his dirty money.”Our Secret Service source supports that contention.“Obama holds real estate, vast sums of currency, and shadow companies across the globe, under many aliases. He doesn’t keep them in his name, as that would be too conspicuous. The administration has learned about many of them and has been working with foreign governments to seize Obama’s illicitly gained assets. Many of these nations are not exactly friendly to the United States; we don’t know what Trump offered in exchange for rights to seize assets in non-extradition countries or put special operations boots on the ground on foreign soil. I’m sure the price way high. Clandestine missions are occurring right now. The Solyndra mansion was just one of many,” our source explained.At 3:00 am (local time), a pair of helicopters, including decoy craft, airlifted Delta to its destination. They found the mansion deserted; however, according to our source, the dwelling had been recently occupied. The unit commander discovered freshly chopped vegetables and lukewarm coffee in the kitchen; outside fresh tire impressions lead away from the compound. Someone, our source said, must have tipped off the occupants shortly before Delta arrived on scene.Still, Delta did not leave the location empty-handed. They seized several encrypted laptops and over 200 million dollars in gold bullion, in addition to dozens of crates containing Chinese manufactured firearms and explosives. Moreover, and perhaps most disturbing, a maze of underground tunnels, ostensibly used for human trafficking, ran for miles in every direction beneath the surface. Having gathered all available evidence, they requested exfiltration and handed-off control to Thai law enforcement.Under power granted by the ASEAN Declaration to Joint Action on Counter Terrorism, Thai officials confiscated the estate and all remaining possessions contained therein.(Visited 18,013 times, 4 visits today)","The target, a secluded luxury compound near the resort town of Pattaya, was believed to be a command and control center for the Obama-led Deep State. The raid led to the capture of several high-value targets, including former CIA Director John Brennan, former National Intelligence Director James Clapper, and Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett, among others.

The operation, code-named “Silent Night,” was carried out by an elite team of Delta Force operators, who were flown in on Air Force special operations helicopters from their base in Okinawa, Japan. The team was supported by Thai special forces units, who provided intelligence and logistical support.

According to our source, President Trump was closely involved in planning the operation and personally authorized the use of Delta Force to neutralize the threat posed by the Obama-controlled Deep State cell. The operation was carried out with the full knowledge and support of the Thai government, which has become increasingly frustrated with Obama’s efforts to undermine the Trump administration.

The raid on the Obama stronghold in Thailand comes just days after a similar operation in Florida, where FBI agents, supported by a SWAT team and a special forces unit, raided the home of a Hillary Clinton collaborator suspected of involvement in the theft of classified documents from the State Department and the unmasking of Trump campaign officials during the 2016 presidential election.

The coordinated actions by the Trump administration and the Thai government represent a significant escalation in the ongoing war against the Deep State. As President Trump continues to dismantle the globalist shadow government, the American people can expect more such operations in the coming months."

Teenagers have often been at the forefront of social movements, from the civil rights movement in the 1960s to the more recent #MeToo movement. The youthful energy and passion that comes with being a teenager can be a powerful force in driving change.

In the case of the March for Our Lives rally, the students have been able to capture the attention of the nation and have forced lawmakers to take notice. Their fresh perspectives and personal experiences have given them a unique voice in the debate on gun control.

Experts say that having teenagers act as figureheads for a movement can be an effective strategy, as it often appeals to the sense of justice and idealism that many young people possess. It also allows for the creation of a narrative that is more relatable and authentic, which can help to mobilize support for a cause.

However, it is important to remember that the responsibility of leading a movement can be a heavy burden for teenagers to bear. They may be subjected to criticism and scrutiny, and the pressure to perform can be overwhelming. As such, it is crucial to provide them with the necessary support and resources to ensure their well-being and success.

In conclusion, the use of teenagers as figureheads in the March for Our Lives movement has proven to be a powerful strategy in raising awareness and driving change. While it is important to recognize the potential risks and challenges faced by these young leaders, their passion and determination should not be underestimated."

The announcement comes at a time when anti-gun activists are intensifying their efforts to dismantle the Second Amendment, which grants US citizens the right to bear arms.

The Pope's remarks have sparked heated debates among believers and non-believers alike, with some arguing that the spiritual leader has overstepped his boundaries. Critics argue that the Bible, which is the foundation of Christianity, does not explicitly prohibit the possession of weapons, and that self-defense is a basic human right.

Proponents of the Pope's statement, however, insist that Jesus' teachings of peace and love are fundamentally incompatible with the act of carrying a weapon. They argue that true Christians should prioritize nonviolent solutions to conflict and trust in God's protection rather than relying on earthly weapons.

As the controversy surrounding gun ownership and the role of faith in public life continues, the Pope's statement adds another layer of complexity to an already divisive issue."

A flight from New York City to Chicago took a horrifying turn yesterday when a flight attendant assaulted a 7-month-old baby boy, causing outrage among passengers and triggering a violent altercation.

Witnesses report that the incident began when a flight attendant forcefully took the infant from his mother, causing the baby to start crying uncontrollably. The attendant then slapped the baby, leaving him with a visible mark on his face.

Upon witnessing the shocking act, enraged passengers began to confront the flight attendant, leading to a heated argument that quickly escalated into a violent brawl.

politifact13560,1,0,"The announcement that Mall of America was welcoming its first black Santa Claus was greeted in many quarters as a good thing but, as might be expected in a country that has become increasingly more comfortable saying any racist thing that comes to mind, many were highly offended. Three years after Fox’s Megyn Kelly definitively explained to America that both Jesus Christ and Santa Claus were white men, Mall of America dismissed her advice and hired Larry Jefferson, a retired U.S. Army veteran from Irving, Texas to spend four days at the mall listening to the wish lists of children of all colors.Among many who were offended by this move was former half-term governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin. The sharp-tongued Republican wasted no time in condemning the company’s actions, going on social media and posting comments that called for boycotting and “running Mall of America into the ground,” on the basis of Santa “always having been white in the Bible.” “No, I refuse to believe that they went this far in trying to cater to the minorities, I thought the company had some backbone but I guess I was wrong,” Palin told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune.She also argued that hiring a non-white Santa Claus was “the last straw” in corporate America’s twisting of traditional, conservative Christian values, “because they realized they couldn’t make any more money off of the usual scams and techniques they’ve been using so far.” She added, “That’s why they had to come up with something new and out of the box, at least something that appeared that way in their minds. But, this proves that they have no morals and that they won’t shy away from even the most blatant twisting of traditional Christian values, just so they could make more money. I understand having to make a profit in order to get by and have a good life, but I don’t understand stomping on things that are holy and sacred in order to accomplish that.”“That’s why Americans, especially white ones, need to boycott the company and need to run it into the ground, so that they never ever come up with such an offensive and sacrilegious idea again,” Palin added. “The Holy Book always said Santa Claus was white and any kind of deviation from that, regardless of its magnitude, is a sin. And we need to make an example out of Mall of America. If we don’t, if we let them get away with it, what’s next? Others will follow their example and the next thing we know, we’re going to be having Arab Santa Clauses that are going to be teaching our kids how to make IEDs out of Christmas lights. I mean, just look at the number of white youngsters infatuated with rap and hip-hop music; you think that’s happening by accident?”“Nope, our children are systematically being indoctrinated into other cultures and interests that have nothing to do with traditional, white Christianity. The numbers of converts to Islam have also spiked, just as much as interracial marriages between white women and members of other ethnic groups. We are being bred out, people, and as innocent as it may seem, a black Santa is just the beginning,” she concluded.","**Title:** Mall of America Welcomes First Black Santa, Draws Mixed Reactions

**Introduction:**

In a move that has been hailed as a step towards inclusivity and diversity, the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, recently announced that it would be welcoming its first black Santa Claus. The decision, which came after years of pressure from civil rights activists and community leaders, was met with a mixture of praise and criticism.

**Body:**

The announcement of the Mall of America's decision to feature a black Santa Claus was greeted with enthusiasm by many, who saw it as a positive development in a nation that has long been associated with the image of a white Santa Claus. However, in a country that has become increasingly more comfortable saying any racist thing that comes to mind, the decision also drew the ire of many who took to social media to express their outrage.

Some critics argue that the decision to feature a black Santa Claus is an attempt to erase the cultural heritage and traditions associated with the iconic holiday figure. Others have claimed that the move is an example of political correctness gone too far, and have accused the Mall of America of pandering to a small but vocal minority.

Despite the backlash, the Mall of America has stood by its decision, stating that it is committed to celebrating the diversity of its customer base and promoting inclusivity. The mall has also announced that it will be hosting a series of events and activities in the lead-up to the holiday season to celebrate the arrival of its first black Santa Claus.

**Conclusion:**

The announcement of the Mall of America's first black Santa Claus has sparked a heated debate about race, tradition, and inclusivity in the United States. While many have welcomed the move as a positive step forward, others have criticized it as an attempt to erase cultural heritage and traditions. As the holiday season approaches, the Mall of America will likely continue to face scrutiny and criticism from both supporters and detractors of its decision."

What AMLO is asking his people is not a surprise…He has an actual strategic policy behind his plan.Apparently, he has been planning this for years but nobody really cared to pay attention.AMLO’s key economic plan for Mexico is to become wealthy, and recently he has received a broad mainstream Mexican understanding.Conservatives in the U.S. have no idea about Mexico’s plan, but the far-left and democratic immigration radicals sure do.Reported by 100percentfedup: Well…at least a leader of Mexico is admitting what’s been going on for a loooong time. The radical open borders element on both sides has been welcoming millions of illegals for decades. Yes, decades…Open borders advocates on the left see policing the border as a form of cruelty and American imperialism.

So, AMLO’s faster plan is to use migration into the U.S. to break down barriers, collapse the economic dam and allow the natural flood of U.S. wealth to flow into Mexico.From the Mexican perspective this is a pretty solid economic approach that just might work; and they have open-border comrades within the progressive, democrat, republican and corporate political systems (all over the U.S) who already support such a strategy.Read More","News Piece:

In a recent statement, a prominent political analyst has asserted that the mainstream media's reluctance to address the issue of illegal immigration is a cause for concern. According to the analyst, the media's failure to recognize and report on the impact of illegal immigration on society is indicative of a broader disconnect between the media and the realities faced by people on the ground.

The analyst argued that, in order to provide accurate and comprehensive coverage, the media must acknowledge the complexities surrounding the issue of illegal immigration. By doing so, they can better inform the public and contribute to a more informed and constructive dialogue on the matter.

This critique comes at a time when immigration policies and their enforcement have become increasingly polarizing issues, both in the United States and around the world. As such, it highlights the need for responsible and balanced reporting that can help to bridge the gap between perception and reality."

We need a great match. Not another rigged result that doesn’t pass the sniff test.“I like money as much as the next guy. But I like football more. I can’t stand by and allow rampant greed and cynicism to destroy the game I love. The little boy in me won’t allow it.“Football in America won’t recover from this.”Early reports stating Goodes had been shot dead in an “gangland-style execution” in New York City have also been scrubbed from the internet, but not before alert readers captured screenshots of the story.According to Goodes, the NFL have organized a “rigged game” that will earn “maximum revenue” for the league, and hundreds of millions for broadcasters and advertisers, but will leave increasingly jaded Americans with a bad taste in their mouth.“This is the biggest scam in sports history,” Goodes said in Minneapolis, according to reports. “The Super Bowl is already completely scripted out.”“How do I know it’s scripted? I’ve read the damn thing.““You need to understand the NFL is a $35 billion shared revenue corporation. Outcomes can’t be left to chance. Total league revenues are shared equally by all franchises, so they don’t care who wins or loses. Let me be perfectly clear here. It doesn’t matter to the franchise owners. It doesn’t matter to the players. But it matters to the league. Outcomes have been fixed to maximize profits ever since my early days here.”“The sad thing is that it’s legal. Can you believe that? It’s legal thanks to guys [entertainment laywers] like me.”Explaining that the NFL is officially registered as “entertainment,” Goodes said “The NFL has more in common with WWE than you could possibly imagine.”The NFL possesses an Anti-Trust Exemption to the law granted to it by President John F. Kennedy, which ultimately allows the NFL to classify itself as “entertainment” rather than sport, as well as incorporate itself as a single entity, instead of the 32 separate “franchises” they would want you to believe.In a 2004 lawsuit, the NFL argued they are not a collection of 32 teams in competition with each other. They argued they are a single entity, providing “entertainment” in the marketplace, and as such they are not subject to Anti-Trust laws.The only other “sport” that occupies this legal position is the WWE.How are games rigged?According to Goodes, the fat cat franchise owners and their pampered players do not care who wins, as long as they continue reaping the lucrative financial benefits provided by the system.“Have you ever stopped to wonder how Vegas makes the point spread line and over under so close every week? There is not one game where the result totally blows away the point spread or the over under. It doesn’t happen. Are they that good? Hell, no they’re not. Even the best of the best cannot get it so close every singl","The NFL lawyer, who has chosen to remain anonymous, was found dead in a hotel room in Manhattan early Tuesday morning, just hours after making the shocking revelation to a group of reporters during a press conference. The lawyer claimed to have evidence that the upcoming Super Bowl LII, set to take place on February 4th, is “rigged” and the outcome has already been determined.

While the cause of death has not yet been determined, police sources say there were no signs of foul play or forced entry. The investigation is ongoing, but authorities are urging the public not to jump to conclusions until the facts are in.

In a statement released by the NFL, the organization expressed their condolences to the family of the deceased and stated they would be cooperating fully with the ongoing investigation. They also denied the allegations of a rigged Super Bowl, calling them “baseless and irresponsible.”

As the news of the lawyer’s death spreads, the internet is abuzz with speculation and conspiracy theories, with some claiming it’s a cover-up and others questioning the timing of the death. Super Bowl LII is set to be one of the most watched events in television history, with millions of fans tuning in to watch the New England Patriots take on the Philadelphia Eagles."

The only food-related duty Lisa has done for the past six months is retrieve Trump’s orders from drive-through windows and scoop the President’s ice cream from the carton.”Mr. Trump’s favorite fast food choices are reportedly Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonalds, and he eats his fried chicken, burgers, and fries with a knife and fork according to a White House staffer who requested anonymity to avoid consequences from leaking about the President’s eating habits to the press.“It’s borderline creepy,” the staffer said. “The first thing Trump does with his fried chicken is pick off all the skin from every piece like he’s dissecting the chickens with a scalpel or something, and then he puts it all in a pile. Then he cuts off all the lean meat and throws it away, leaving just the pieces of fat which he then eats individually with pieces of the crispy skin he peeled off. It’s gotta be a warning sign of a serial killer or something.”Mr. Trump’s McDonalds habits are even weirder.“He orders the same thing every time,” said the staffer. “He orders two big macs, a large fry, a diet coke of course, and an M&M McFlurry that he has Lisa dig out and remove every brown M&M, and then he makes her dump out half of the ice cream and fill it back up with extra M&M’s. Then he cuts off pieces of his big macs and dips them in the McFlurry so every bite has ice cream and chocolate on it. He dips his fries, still with a fork, in the diet coke as if it were a condiment. The sight of this never gets normal.

politifact14776,1,0,"Pope Francis’s latest controversial statement – that “Jesus is metaphorical, not literal” – has pushed the Catholic Church to the verge of open mutiny, with multiple Vatican cardinals going on the record declaring Pope Francis is the false prophet foretold in holy scripture and prophecy.The statement made by Pope Francis during Holy Mass in the Vatican on Sunday is the latest in a long line of unconventional statements uttered by the pontiff since he ascended the highest office in the Catholic Church, becoming the first jesuit pope in history.Since assuming the papacy in 2013, Pope Francis has operated as a mouthpiece of the globalist movement, taking every opportunity to push the New World Order agenda. A short list of Francis’s most controversial statements include:PREACHING THAT ‘JESUS TURNED INTO SATAN’Pope Francis went where no other Christian, let alone Pope, had ever gone before, accusing Jesus of “debasing himself up to the point of totally annihilating himself”, and “turning into Satan.”Hardcore Francis apologists claim the quote was taken out of context, but when the passage is read in it’s entirety it is clear that Francis meant exactly what he said.Making matters worse, Pope Francis later doubled down, spreading Satanic doctrine further, when he said that Jesus Christ “made himself the devil, the serpent, for us,” according to L’Osservatore Romano, the daily newspaper of the Vatican.PREACHING THAT RELATIONSHIPS WITH JESUS ARE ‘HARMFUL’The heretical statement by Pope Francis comes after he broke with centuries of Christian tradition earlier this year, telling a crowd of 33,000 Catholics in Rome that “a personal, direct, immediate relationship with Jesus Christ” must be avoided at all costs.“Having a personal relationship with Jesus is dangerous and very harmful,” the pope said during the June 25 speech.The unconventional teachings of Pope Francis have caused Vatican Cardinals and senior priests to turn their back on the pontiff and refuse to pledge obedience to him.OPENLY CALLING FOR ‘ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT’In July this year Pope Francis told the Italian newspaper La Repubblica that the United States of America has “a distorted vision of the world” and Americans must be ruled by a world government, as soon as possible, “for their own good.”The week before he also called for “a one world government” and “political authority”, arguing that the creation of the one world government is needed to combat major issues such as “climate change.”Speaking with Ecuador’s El Universo newspaper, the Pope said that the United Nations doesnt have enough power and must be granted full governmental control “for the good of humanity.”France’s Marine Le Pen described Pope Francis as a “globalist bulldog“. Vladimir Putin argued that Francis’s unconventional teachings disqualified the Pope from calling himself a man of God. Francis’s own Cardinals are in open revolt against him, telling anybody who will listen that he was installed in unusual circumstances, with the assistance of globalist powerbrokers like George Soros.Pope Francis’s anti-Christian teachings are forcing Christians around the world to confront the difficult question – is he the false prophet that will precede the antichrist foretold in holy scripture?","Pope Francis's latest controversial statement – that ""Jesus is metaphorical, not literal"" – has sent shockwaves through the Catholic Church, with many faithful questioning the legitimacy of the pontiff's teachings. The statement, made during a private meeting with a group of theologians, has since been leaked to the public, sparking a heated debate among the Church's highest ranks.

In the wake of the statement, multiple Vatican cardinals have come forward to express their disapproval, with some even going so far as to declare Pope Francis as the false prophet foretold in holy scripture and prophecy. These cardinals argue that the Pope's statement undermines the very foundation of Christianity, which is based on the belief that Jesus is the Son of God and the literal savior of humanity.

As a result of the growing dissent, the Catholic Church finds itself on the verge of open mutiny, with some clergy members openly questioning the authority of the papacy. The crisis has also led to a schism among the laity, with many faithful citizens feeling betrayed by the Pope's words and questioning whether they can still trust the Church's leadership.

The Vatican has yet to issue an official response to the mounting criticism, and it remains unclear how Pope Francis will address the concerns of his fellow cardinals and the faithful. However, one thing is certain: the Catholic Church will have to navigate these troubled waters carefully if it hopes to maintain its credibility and unity in the face of such a profound controversy."
politifact15591,1,1,"Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel has been fired for covering-up the truth about what happened during the Parkland shooting.According to reports, following a criminal investigation by Florida Governor Rick Scott, Sheriff Israel will be replaced as early as next week.From Big League Politics: Sheriff Israel is being removed from office for criminal issues, not malfeasance, following an investigation conducted by the office of Florida Governor Rick Scott. The source exclusively revealed to Big League Politics that Sheriff Israel is also allegedly being investigated by the IRS.The high-level police source within the Sheriff’s Office disclosed that over the last several months, four candidates have been interviewed to refill the position of Broward County Sheriff. One of the candidates who were interviewed is Emery Giany, a Republican Florida law enforcement official who is closely associated with Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi.During the IG’s testimony last week, FBI director Christopher Wray was asked about the Parkland school shooting. When asked, Wray declined to answer any questions about the shooting and Sheriff Israel, citing that it was an active FBI investigation. Following the Parkland shooting, Governor Scott called for Director Wray to resign over the FBI’s failure to properly investigate Nikolas Cruz, 19, the school shooter whose plans to carry out a school shooting were reported to the FBI twice prior to the shooting on Valentine’s Day.“We constantly promote ‘see something, say something,’ and a courageous person did just that to the FBI. And the FBI failed to act. ‘See something, say something’ is an incredibly important tool and people must have confidence in the follow through from law enforcement. The FBI Director needs to resign,” Governor Scott said.According to the source in the Broward Sheriffs office, Sheriff Israel’s removal revolves around a criminal matter that the FBI is aware of. Although his failures surrounding the Parkland shooting initially sparked the investigation, it isn’t the sole reason why he is being removed.The high-level source who wished to remain anonymous told Big League Politics that Sheriff Israel is already aware of the fact that he is being removed from office next week.Sheriff Israel has been under heavy criticism for his handling of the of the Parkland school shooting, which left 17 people dead. Following the Valentine’s Day school massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, it was revealed that police officers under Sheriff Israel’s order were called to the home of the Parkland shooter 45 times prior to the school shooting.It is unclear why law enforcement officials law enforcement at the Broward County Sheriff’s office and FBI failed to properly investigate Cruz, but their massive failure has been directly attributed to the loss of 17 lives in Parkland, FL.Since the Parkland shooting, a lot of unflattering information has come out regarding Sheriff Israel. Along with being a mouthpiece for Democratic politicians and gun control advocates, like Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz who he has been photographed with, Sheriff Israel and his department have recently made headlines for more controversy.In May, it was revealed that Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school and the Broward County Sheriff’s office were keeping quiet the fact that Sheriff Israel’s son, Brett, had allegedly assaulted a 14 year old student on campus in an act of bullying.Shortly after the Parkland shooting, cell phone video filmed by Cruz himself revealed that he himself felt bullied, which lead him to carry out a massacre on February 14, 2018 in a targeted attack against his former classmates.Most recently, Sheriff Israel received a massive amount of backlash after the Broward County Sheriff’s office tweeted a picture of a new custom made Broward sheriff’s car that read, “Our new #dodge #charger. Do you like the paint job?”The tweet sparked outrage online from Republicans and Democrats alike ","The Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) conducted a three-month investigation into the Broward County Sheriff's Office's handling of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting on February 14, 2018. The investigation found numerous failures, including inadequate training and command structure issues, which led to the deaths of 17 people.

Governor Rick Scott stated that Sheriff Israel's ""failure to act and protect the students and staff at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School is unacceptable.""

politifact15631,1,0,"Lisa Page, former FBI lawyer under James Comey and Andrew McCabe, has become the latest rat to depart the sinking ship.According to testimony given by Page during two days of closed-door House hearings, former bosses at the FBI instructed her to cover-up the fact that China, not Russia, hacked the DNC server.Truepundit.com reports: The embattled Page tossed James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok and Bill Priestap among others under the Congressional bus, alleging the upper echelon of the FBI concealed intelligence confirming Chinese state-backed ‘assets’ had illegally acquired former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s 30,000+ “missing” emails, federal sources said.The Russians didn’t do it. The Chinese did, according to well-placed FBI sources.And while Democratic lawmakers and the mainstream media prop up Russia as America’s boogeyman, it was the ironically Chinese who acquired Hillary’s treasure trove of classified and top secret intelligence from her home-brewed private server.And a public revelation of that magnitude — publicizing that a communist world power intercepted Hillary’s sensitive and top secret emails — would have derailed Hillary Clinton’s presidential hopes. Overnight. But it didn’t simply because it was concealed.FBI bosses knew of the breach yet did nothing to investigate, seemingly trying to run out the clock on the alarming revelations to protect Hillary during her heated presidential campaign with Trump. So instead of investigating the hacking of Clinton’s server, FBI bosses sat quietly.And did nothing to confirm the Chinese assets were linked to their government. Or assess the damage such a tremendous breach posed to national security. Did the Chinese government access Hillary’s emails? The FBI didn’t care enough to investigate at the risk of besmirching Clinton and further soiling her during the election.Hundreds of top secret documents and even the president’s daily travel and security itineraries were on that server — and intercepted by a communist country — yet the FBI sat on the evidence. Likewise, all of Clinton’s and her inner circle’s outgoing emails were compromised as well, sources confirmed.Even the Inspector General had tipped off the FBI — specifically Strzok — about the foreign breach. Still, no timely case was pursued.That same cover-up pattern fits FBI bosses who time after time stalled and concealed other criminal intelligence on Clinton in the weeks prior to the election.We could write more detail here and ramble on and on but at this point, we simply ask.Is anyone going to go to prison for politicizing the FBI and covering up countless crimes committed by FBI personnel in a variety of coordinated schemes to protect Hillary and the Democrats?","Lisa Page, a former FBI lawyer who served under both James Comey and Andrew McCabe, has made headlines recently as the latest high-profile departure from the bureau. In an unexpected move, Page resigned from her position earlier this week, sparking speculation about the motivations behind her decision.

A source close to the situation revealed that Page's resignation comes amid ongoing internal investigations into the FBI's conduct during the 2016 presidential election. These probes have reportedly uncovered instances of misconduct and bias within the organization, leading some to question the integrity of the FBI's actions during that time.

Page's resignation follows a pattern of high-profile departures from the FBI in recent months, as the agency faces increasing scrutiny over its handling of various investigations. Critics argue that these departures are indicative of a deeper problem within the organization, with some even going so far as to label it a ""sinking ship.""

As the FBI continues to face criticism and scrutiny, it remains to be seen how these recent departures will impact the agency's ability to regain public trust and effectively carry out its mission."
politifact11773,1,0,"335 SHARES SHARE THIS STORYRepublican attacks on transgendered Americans and the religious fight to keep gender a binary delineation took a turn for the bizarre this week when Virginia Republican Mark Cole filed a bill that would force schools to check the genitals of their students in order to ensure that they are using facilities reserved for their “anatomical sex:”Local school boards shall develop and implement policies that require every school restroom, locker room, or shower room that is designated for use by a specific gender to solely be used by individuals whose anatomical sex matches such gender designation. Such policies may also provide that a student may, upon request, be granted access, to the extent reasonable, to a single stall restroom or shower, a unisex bathroom, or controlled individual use of a restroom, locker room, or shower. Any student who willfully and knowingly violates this section shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $50. Civil penalties assessed under this section shall be paid into the Literary Fund. Any law-enforcement officer may issue a summons regarding a violation of this section.He did not deign to inform us how this would be accomplished, but it’s hard to imagine any scenario that did not involve adults inspecting the genitals of children before using the bathroom. Notably, it also provides for stigmatizing transgendered children by isolating them in a single person bathroom, which the Department of Justice ruled in June was a violation of the student’s rights. It is a disgusting show of transphobia that has no place in our public schools; the GOP must accept that America is a multi-gendered, multi-ethnic nation, and no amount of perverted laws is going to change that.Download our NEW Occupy Democrats app for your iPhone by clicking here or for your Android by clicking here.Add your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the President’s crimes. IMPEACH DONALD TRUMP!","— Virginia House Bill No. 1612

In a statement to reporters, Cole claimed that his bill was necessary to prevent “girls from being exposed to male genitalia” in school restrooms and other facilities. The bill, if passed, would require school administrators to conduct genital inspections of students to ensure that they are using the correct facilities.

Critics of the bill, including the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and LGBTQ+ advocacy groups, have denounced the proposal as an invasive and discriminatory measure that would violate the privacy rights of transgender students. They argue that the bill would create a hostile environment for transgender students and potentially lead to increased bullying and harassment.

As the national debate over transgender rights and gender identity continues, Virginia's proposed legislation has drawn widespread criticism and renewed concerns about the treatment of transgender individuals in American society. The bill is expected to face significant opposition in the Virginia legislature, with Democrats vowing to block the measure and advocacy groups preparing to challenge it in court if it passes."

California law currently states that someone is incapable of holding office if they are not a citizen at the time of their appointment.“California is stronger when we utilize talents of all our residents, and opening state and local boards and commissions to every Californian will allow us to better serve our diverse communities,” Sen. Ricardo Lara, D-Bell Gardens, and the bill’s author said in a statement. “Undocumented Californians are our neighbors, co-workers, and parents, and as lawmakers, we can’t make good policy if their voices are left out of the discussion.”It marked the first time the Senate appointed someone living within the borders of the United States illegally to a state post.

The White House is now free of all pagan gods and idols, and contains only Christian iconography.“Because apparently during the eight years when Obama was there, and maybe even some of the presidents before him, there were all kinds of idol gods and images and all kinds of artifacts in there that were demonic, even some of the stuff from the Clinton era,” Begley said.The White House pastor then related that the First Lady said, “‘You’ve got to get all of that out of there and send in some preachers and priests‘” – she wanted respected Christian leaders — to go in and cleanse the White House or, ‘I will not spend one night in it.’”“I have to say, when the president allowed 40 pastors to come in to the White House and anoint him with oil and lay their hands and pray on him—seven times he’s done this—that is unheard of,” Begley said. “We haven’t ever – the guy’s got flaws, we all do.

WikiLeaks emails revealed he and his brother Tony fraternized with Marina Abramovich at Satanic “spirit cooking” dinner parties, featuring pig’s blood, countless human fluids, and mock human sacrifices.With previous tenants like the Clintons and Obamas, and the kind of company those families kept, it is no wonder Melania Trump demanded the White House undergo a full exorcism before she set foot in the building.","First Lady Melania Trump has reportedly demanded that the White House undergo a complete exorcism to cleanse the building of ""pagan idols and demonic artifacts"" from the ""Clinton and Obama years,"" according to White House pastor Paul Begley.

In an interview with ""The Alex Jones Show,"" Begley revealed that the First Lady was concerned about the ""dark energy"" within the historic residence, which she believed was caused by the presence of these items.

""Melania is a believer, and she believes in the power of prayer,"" Begley said. ""She was concerned about the spiritual climate in the White House, and she wanted to make sure the house was cleansed and protected.""

According to Begley, the First Lady asked for the exorcism to be performed before she would move into the White House in January 2017. He added that the ceremony was carried out by a team of priests and that all of the ""occult objects"" were removed from the building.

Begley's revelations have sparked a wave of criticism from liberal commentators, who have accused the First Lady of promoting a superstitious and divisive worldview. However, others have praised her for taking seriously the need to protect the White House from negative influences.

White House officials have not commented on the matter, and it remains unclear whether the exorcism has had any impact on the Trump administration's policies or decision-making."

politifact15371,1,0,"President Trump and his administration just voted against a United Nations ban on the death penalty for being gay, making the United States of America (it’s hard to think this is actually really happening) just one of 13 other countries in the world to oppose such a historic vote.A few other notable countries who voted against the ban were China, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, and Egypt.The resolution wasn’t sought to ban the death penalty entirely, but instead to keep it from being imposed in a ‘discriminatory manner,’ particularly in six countries where the death penalty is used for people known to be in same-sex relationships: Iran, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Yemen, Nigeria, and Somalia.While some are saying that a ‘no’ vote might imply a rejection of the death penalty in general, The Human Rights Council resolution specifically stated that it condemned the “imposition of the death penalty as a sanction for specific forms of conduct, such as apostasy, blasphemy, adultery and consensual same-sex relations.”To have a ‘no’ vote puts the United States in a very select group of countries. Not exactly the best group to be in agreement with on an issue like this.Renato Sabbadini, the executive director of The International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, said:“It is unconscionable to think that there are hundreds of millions of people living in states where somebody may be executed simply because of whom they love.” “This is a monumental moment where the international community has publicly highlighted that these horrific laws simply must end.”Since taking office, Trump has made a number of political appointments and policy moves against the LGBT community, including:Having The Department of Justice and Department of Education rescind guidance that defended the rights of transgender students to safety use bathrooms at schools that correspond to their gender identity.Saying publicly that transgenders could no longer serve in the military, and then issuing a directive to the Department of Defense to implement such an order.Signing an executive order in March that rescinded an Obama-era rule that companies have to prove they treat LGBT employees fairly.Fortunately, the measure passed with 27 countries voting for it, but it still sends a chilling message about a new United States agenda on human rights.","A shocking turn of events has emerged from the United Nations, as President Trump and his administration voted against a landmark resolution seeking to implement a global ban on the death penalty for being gay. This decision places the United States of America in the company of only 13 other countries worldwide that oppose the measure.

The resolution, which was presented to the UN General Assembly's Third Committee, aimed to protect the LGBTQ+ community from the threat of capital punishment. Despite receiving overwhelming support from 128 nations, the Trump administration's decision to oppose the ban has left many reeling in disbelief.

""This is a devastating blow to the global fight for LGBTQ+ rights,"" said Human Rights Watch Deputy Director, Andrea Prasow. ""The Trump administration's decision to side with a handful of countries that still sanction the death penalty for same-sex relations is shameful.""

The UN resolution comes at a critical time, as numerous countries still carry out the death penalty for same-sex acts, despite ongoing efforts to abolish the practice. The Trump administration's stance on this issue has further alienated the United States from its Western allies and raises serious questions about its commitment to human rights.

In a statement released by the US Mission to the UN, it was argued that the ban would infringe upon individual states' sovereignty and that the death penalty is a matter of domestic policy. However, critics argue that this position undermines the United States' moral authority and its role as a global leader in promoting human rights.

As the world grapples with this latest development, activists and lawmakers alike are urging the Trump administration to reconsider its position and join the international community in condemning this heinous form of punishment. The fight for LGBTQ+ rights and global human rights continues, but the road ahead seems to be growing increasingly challenging."

Well, it isn’t working at all.As I said above, Villanueva is the only member of that ‘team’ that stood up for America and he was then muscled by thugs threatening his life and livelihood and who forced him to do a miserable retraction of his good, patriotic deed.

This man said something rash. He is immediately punished. The NFL players who decided to toss the US flag in the trash and attack the President for talking about their disrespect of the US voters and citizens…they should also be punished heavily, no? Of course! Liberals think PC punishment is a one way street.They can cuss, swear, be abusive, harass and even physically attack fellow citizens and nothing is done to stop this! But anyone else says the wrong words and they lose their jobs and are punished in many ways.

Calls to stop the NFL gravy train is rising. Even if Goodell manages to muscle the teams into behaving themselves, it is not going to work for the fan base can see that the people playing the game really hate them and so this comrade business is kaput.According to FOX Sports over the last 20 years, the American public has spent more than $7 billion dollars to build or renovate NFL stadiums, taking on 46 percent of the total costs of those projects. It’s time to cut them off. They don’t respect the country. Why should the country respect them?The coach of the Steelers sponsored Hillary’s run for President.

But they still suck off the public teat ","Yes, that’s right, for each of the Pittsburgh Steelers who dared to skip the National Anthem during their game against the Chicago Bears, they will be fined a whopping $1,000,000 each.

Now, you might think, what’s the big deal? Well, let me tell you, this is a very big deal, as it marks the first time in history the NFL has actually done something to punish these disrespectful players who continue to kneel or sit during the National Anthem, despite the massive backlash from fans who are fed up with the politicization of their favorite sport.

But the real kicker here is that the commissioner of this league, who has stood idly by and allowed this disrespect to continue unchecked for years, has finally decided to take action. And while some might argue that the fine is simply a way for the NFL to save face and try to appease the angry fans, the reality is that it’s a step in the right direction.

So, let this be a lesson to all those overpaid, ungrateful football players out there: if you want to disrespect our country, our flag, and the brave men and women who have fought and died for our freedoms, you’re going to have to pay a hefty price. And if the NFL continues to take action against these divisive protests, maybe, just maybe, we can finally get back to enjoying the game we all love without the added drama and controversy."

Trump has called on team owners to fire players who participate in the protests, a stance that has been met with opposition from many within the NFL, as well as from civil rights activists and other high-profile figures.

""Pulling out of the Paris Agreement is a huge step backward in our global efforts to combat climate change, and it puts the future of our planet at risk.""

Pitt went on to explain that the Paris Agreement, signed by nearly 200 countries in 2015, was a landmark achievement in global cooperation to fight climate change. By withdrawing from the agreement, the United States is abdicating its leadership role in the world and undermining the progress that has been made thus far.

""We can't afford to wait any longer to take action on climate change,"" Pitt urged. ""The science is clear, and the stakes are too high. We need to hold our leaders accountable and demand that they take the necessary steps to protect our planet for future generations.""

In a shocking announcement that has sent shockwaves throughout the political world, former United States President Barack Obama has revealed his intentions to become the next Secretary-General of the United Nations. The move, which many consider a bold and unexpected career shift, would place Obama at the helm of the international organization, allowing him to advance his globalist agenda on the world's stage.

Speaking at a press conference earlier today, Obama outlined his vision for a more unified and cooperative world, stating that he believes the United Nations is the perfect platform to achieve these goals. ""I have always believed in the power of international cooperation and the potential of the United Nations to bring about positive change,"" he explained. ""I am excited to take on this new role and work alongside the world's leaders to tackle the pressing issues that affect us all.""

Obama's decision to pursue this position comes at a time when the United Nations is facing numerous challenges, including rising tensions between major powers, climate change, and the ongoing battle against pandemics. The former president's vast experience in diplomacy and his proven ability to navigate complex global issues are seen by many as valuable assets that could help restore confidence in the organization.

Despite the initial support for Obama's candidacy, the road to becoming the next Secretary-General is not without obstacles. The United Nations General Assembly, which elects the Secretary-General, consists of 193 member states, and the process of securing the necessary votes could be a challenging and time-consuming endeavor.

Moreover, critics of Obama's decision have raised concerns about the potential politicization of the United Nations, with some arguing that his nomination could undermine the organization's credibility and impartiality. Others have expressed concerns that Obama's globalist agenda may prioritize certain issues or regions over others, leading to a perceived bias in the way the United Nations operates.

As the world awaits the outcome of Obama's bid for the United Nations' top post, one thing is certain: the political landscape is set to undergo a significant shift, with potential repercussions that will be felt for years to come."
politifact14818,1,0,"Before the Obama administration approved a controversial deal in 2010 giving Moscow control of a large swath of American uranium, the FBI had gathered substantial evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering designed to grow Vladimir Putin’s atomic energy business inside the United States, according to government documents and interviews.Federal agents used a confidential U.S. witness working inside the Russian nuclear industry to gather extensive financial records, make secret recordings and intercept emails as early as 2009 that showed Moscow had compromised an American uranium trucking firm with bribes and kickbacks in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, FBI and court documents show.They also obtained an eyewitness account — backed by documents — indicating Russian nuclear officials had routed millions of dollars to the U.S. designed to benefit former President Bill Clinton William (Bill) Jefferson ClintonBill Clinton's novel sees fastest fiction sales in two years From Singapore, skepticism and hope The Memo: Summit gives Trump political boost — with risks MORE’s charitable foundation during the time Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonSessions defends firing Comey, warns DOJ report could prompt more terminations Sanders gets best reception at early 2020 audition Hillicon Valley: DHS gets new cyber chief | White House warns lawmakers not to block ZTE deal | White nationalists find home on Google Plus | Comcast outbids Disney for Fox | Anticipation builds for report on FBI Clinton probe MORE served on a government body that provided a favorable decision to Moscow, sources told The Hill.The racketeering scheme was conducted “with the consent of higher level officials” in Russia who “shared the proceeds” from the kickbacks, one agent declared in an affidavit years later.ADVERTISEMENTRather than bring immediate charges in 2010, however, the Department of Justice (DOJ) continued investigating the matter for nearly four more years, essentially leaving the American public and Congress in the dark about Russian nuclear corruption on U.S. soil during a period when the Obama administration made two major decisions benefiting Putin’s commercial nuclear ambitions.The first decision occurred in October 2010, when the State Department and government agencies on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States unanimously approved the partial sale of Canadian mining company Uranium One to the Russian nuclear giant Rosatom, giving Moscow control of more than 20 percent of America’s uranium supply.When this sale was used by Trump on the campaign trail last year, Hillary Clinton’s spokesman said she was not involved in the committee review and noted the State Department official who handled it said she “never intervened ... on any [Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States] matter.”In 2011, the administration gave approval for Rosatom’s Tenex subsidiary to sell commercial uranium to U.S. nuclear power plants in a partnership with the United States Enrichment Corp. Before then, Tenex had been limited to selling U.S. nuclear power plants reprocessed uranium recovered from dismantled Soviet nuclear weapons under the 1990s Megatons to Megawatts peace program.“The Russians were compromising American contractors in the nuclear industry with kickbacks and extortion threats, all of which raised legitimate national security concerns. And none of that evidence got aired before the Obama administration made those decisions,” a person who worked on the case told The Hill, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by U.S. or Russian officials.The Obama administration’s decision to approve Rosatom’s purchase of Uranium One has been a source of political controversy since 2015.That’s when conservative author Peter Schweitzer and The New York Times documented how Bill Clinton collected hundreds of thousands of do","In a series of court cases starting in 2009 and continuing for several years afterward, federal prosecutors and FBI agents pieced together a complex picture of corruption and deceit as they uncovered the Russian plot to control a significant portion of the U.S. uranium supply.

The evidence was so compelling that it led to the conviction of several Russian officials and the execution of an FBI sting operation that resulted in the arrest and extradition of a top Russian nuclear official.

Despite the mountain of evidence, the Obama administration moved forward with the uranium deal, which had far-reaching national security implications, and the case was never publicly disclosed during the tenure of the former president.

The new revelations, which are being reported for the first time by The Hill, raise questions about the Obama administration’s decision-making process and whether it was appropriate to approve the deal given the corruption evidence that was known at the time.

The FBI’s investigation and subsequent convictions were a result of a joint operation between the FBI and the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Office of Inspector General, which was focused on rooting out corruption in the nuclear industry.

As lawmakers and investigators delve into the circumstances surrounding the approval of the uranium deal, they are expected to scrutinize the role played by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who was a member of the Obama administration’s Cabinet when the deal was approved.

Clinton has come under criticism for her ties to the deal, which was approved in 2010 when she was serving as secretary of state. Her husband, former President Bill Clinton, collected a $500,000 speaking fee from a Russian bank tied to the Kremlin in 2010, as the uranium deal was under consideration.

In addition, donors linked to the deal contributed millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation, raising questions about potential conflicts of interest during the approval process.

The new revelations about the corruption probe and the convictions of Russian nuclear officials are likely to fuel the debate over the uranium deal and its implications for U.S. national security.

Critics of the deal, including some lawmakers and conservative activists, have long argued that it was a giveaway that put U.S. national security at risk by allowing a strategic rival like Russia to gain control of significant uranium resources inside the United States."

First of all, we’re going to have this financial collapse. We’re setting up for a massive financial collapse and I think if God is going to hurt this country that’s probably the way he’d do it.”At that point, a viewer called in and inquired Robertson whether his grim predictions of such a crisis can somehow be averted, to which Robertson gave a somewhat confusing answer: “I believe so, yes, but we need to stop spreading lesbianism and homosexuality in order to achieve that. And the only way to stop the spread of these diseases that are plaguing the country is to make some sort of obvious distinction between gay people and normal, straight people.”“I personally believe that we must impose a rule on the gay population that would require them to wear specially-colored clothes, for example. I’m thinking we need to go through the Senate with this and we need to make it official. That way, regular people would know that the person wearing the said color is a deviant sodomite and that they need to stay away from them at all cost, as well as keep their children away from their reach,” Robertson opined.The viewer then interrupted “The 700 Club” host to state that “that sounds awfully like what Nazis did to Jews in the events leading up to World War II,” referring to the fact that Jews in pre-WWII Poland and Germany were made to wear Jewish badges, or yellow badges, which were cloth patches that Jews were ordered to sew on their outer garments to mark them as Jews in public. It served as a badge of shame.“I don’t believe that,” Robertson quickly became defensive. “I am simply talking about protecting regular people in America, not setting out gays and lesbians as members of the population that should be tortured and slaughtered in concentration camps. Do you understand my point of view here?” the host asked the caller.“I do,” the caller replied. “But I also understand that you’re trying to do to gay people what the Nazis did to my people more than half a century ago.

In a recent episode of his popular television program ""The 700 Club,"" Robertson reiterated his prediction that the advancement of LGBTQ rights in the United States would provoke God to bring about the collapse of the nation's financial markets.

Addressing his viewers, Robertson claimed that the country's increasing acceptance of the LGBTQ community has enraged the Almighty, who is now preparing to unleash His wrath upon the nation. ""America's embrace of the LGBTQ lifestyle has gone too far, and God will not tolerate it any longer,"" he said. ""The financial markets will pay the price for our transgressions, and it will be a devastating blow to our economy.""

Robertson's comments have elicited a strong response from both supporters and critics. While some believe that his warnings are a reflection of God's divine judgment, others argue that they are an attempt to promote a harmful and discriminatory agenda under the guise of religious belief.

Regardless of the controversy surrounding his statements, Robertson's influence as a televangelist cannot be denied. His predictions and declarations have the power to shape public opinion and policy, making it crucial for Americans to engage in open and honest discussions about the role of religion in public life."

While the sharp incline of the death rate of white males is a good start, the solution to the ‘white question’ will not be reached until there is a sharp decline in the population of white females as well. Much more needs to be done in this regard if this country is ever to advance from its ignorant backwardness towards being an actually inhabitable nation.Thankfully, the Prophet Muhammad has given us a foolproof way to speed up the decline of a vanquished nation by treating their women as our sex slaves. They may try and fight the unstoppable tide, but their resistance will grow only weaker as the white race loses its ability to keep its head above water. We may yet see some final convulsions before white Middle America is decreased to a manageable number where it can be more easily controlled.”The blog post was removed from Zakaria’s blog within a few hours, after it began to receive negative attention.CNN officials have refused to take action against their employee.“Every death of a white person brings tears of joy to my eyes,” Zakaria posted on his Twitter account shortly after having to remove his blog post, in what is believed to be a passive-aggressive response to his critics.Photo Credit: World Economic Forum",Please write a news piece based on the 'sentence' provided.

Archaeologists associated with Niagara University of and master divers from the U.S Coast Guard were mobilized on site to determine what it was, and they soon realized that they were dealing with a German submarine that sank during World War II.A wreck recovery vessel of the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society was mandated to refloat the ship and bring it back to Niagara Falls, where it must be restored before becoming a museum ship. The delicate recovery operation took nearly 30 hours to complete, but the submarine was finally brought down on the bank with relative ease.The divers of the U.S. Coast guard braved the frigid water temperature to go attach cables to the wreck for the recovery operation.The submarine was identified as the UX-791, a unique experimental German submarine, based on the U-1200 model, and known to have participated in the “Battle of the St. Lawrence”. It was reported missing in 1943 and was believed to have been sunk near the Canadian coastProfessor Mark Carpenter, who leads the team of archaeologists, believes that the U-boat could have traveled up the St-Lawrence River, all the way to the Great Lakes, where it intended to disturb the American economy.A report from the dated from February 1943 suggests, that the ship could have attacked and destroyed three cargo ships and two fishing vessels, even damaging the USS Sable (IX-81), an aircraft carrier of the U.S. navy that was used for training in the Great Lakes, before finally being sunk by anti-sub grenades launched by a Canadian frigate.“We have known for a long time that the Nazis had sent some of their U-boats in the St-Lawrence River, but this is the first proof that they actually reached the Great Lakes,” Professor Carpenter told reporters. “This could explain the mysterious ship disappearances that took place in the region in 1943, and the reported “Battle of Niagara Falls” which had always been dismissed as a collective hallucination caused by fear.”The restoration of the submarine could take more than two years, but once completed, the museum ship is expected to become one of the major tourist attractions of the region.",The submarine is believed to have sunk during the second World War.

The system they use is called Global Forecast System (GFS).At 2:00 this afternoon, Friday, September 1, the GFS model spit out its projection of Hurricane IRMA’s path over the next 12 days.

Experts warn that if the storm maintains its current trajectory and intensity, it could cause catastrophic damage to New York City and most of New Jersey on September 10, potentially leading to the total destruction of all five boroughs of New York City and large swaths of the Garden State.

The simulations, conducted by a team of meteorologists and engineers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), show that Hurricane IRMA could bring unprecedented flooding to the region, particularly in low-lying areas like Manhattan and parts of New Jersey. The storm is expected to combine with a cold front moving east from the Great Lakes, causing heavy rainfall and potentially life-threatening winds.

In a press conference held earlier today, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio urged residents to take the threat seriously and to follow evacuation orders. ""We cannot afford to take any chances with a storm of this magnitude,"" de Blasio said. ""If these simulations prove accurate, the damage could be irreparable, and we must do everything in our power to protect our citizens.""

Governor of New Jersey, Phil Murphy, echoed the mayor's sentiments, saying that the state is taking all necessary precautions to ensure the safety of its residents. ""We are working closely with local, state, and federal agencies to coordinate a response to this potential disaster,"" Murphy said. ""Our top priority is to minimize the risk to our citizens and to mitigate the damage as much as possible.""

As the storm continues to approach, residents in the path of Hurricane IRMA are urged to follow updates from local authorities and to heed evacuation orders. The potential destruction of all five boroughs of New York City and most of New Jersey is a scenario that cannot be ignored, and officials are taking every precaution to ensure the safety of the millions of people in the region."
politifact15178,1,0,"George W. Bush has lobbed thinly-veiled critiques of President Donald Trump on his approach to the press and the travel ban from some Muslim-majority countries. | AP Photo Former presidents walk fine line in Trump’s America Trump's predecessors are trying to both defend their legacies and respect the unwritten rule of not undermining the current commander in chief.During his “American carnage” inaugural address, President Donald Trump sent a clear message: all of the presidents in recent memory have failed the American people.The harsh rhetoric of Trump’s inaugural address made an impression on his predecessors, with George W. Bush reportedly calling it “some weird s--t” and Jimmy Carter saying he “flinched” when Trump appeared to back off America's commitment to human rights.Story Continued BelowIn Trump’s America, the five living former presidents are walking a fine line, attempting to defend their legacies while also trying to respect the “unwritten rule” that former presidents avoid undermining their successors.“The immediate former presidents have been more active in their criticism of the current president,” George C. Edwards, a presidential historian at Texas A&M, said. “This kind of thing has been going on throughout history, but normally it’s not very much. This is very early in a tenure and to have former presidents being critical of the president… is pretty unusual.”As Obama returns to the public spotlight, his former aides have made it clear he has no intention of talking much about Trump. However, he’s made his displeasure clear.Obama, who campaigned heavily for Hillary Clinton, said he was “heartened” by the protests following Trump’s immigration ban targeting Muslim-majority countries. He also released a lengthy statement defending the Affordable Care Act against Trump’s attempts to repeal it.At a speech in Boston on Sunday night, Obama avoided mentioning Trump by name, but again forcefully defended his signature health care legislation and mentioned immigration reform. “I expect to be busy, if not with a second career, at least a second act,” Obama said Sunday.And on Monday, Obama’s aides aggressively pushed back against Trump for trying to blame his predecessor for the woes associated with Trump’s disgraced former national security adviser Michael Flynn. While Trump and White House press secretary Sean Spicer have repeatedly denounced Obama for not revoking Flynn’s security clearance, Obama aides told reporters that Obama tried to warn Trump about Flynn’s erratic nature.George W. Bush, meanwhile, has lobbed thinly veiled critiques of Trump on his approach to the press and the travel ban from some Muslim-majority countries. “I consider the media to be indispensable to democracy,” Bush said in an interview with “Today” in February. “We need an independent media to hold people like me to account.”As for the travel ban, Bush was restrained but clear in his concern. “I am for an immigration policy that's welcoming and upholds the law,” Bush said.Carter also voiced concerns after Trump’s inauguration. During an early April appearance at Emory University, he said he wanted to avoid addressing politics but he hoped the women’s movement would be “invigorated” by Trump and that he didn’t see “any glimmer of hope” from the administration on race and gender issues.Bill Clinton, who was harshly critical of Trump during the Manhattan businessman’s presidential campaign, didn’t mince words about Trump when he ran into a local newspaper editor while holiday shopping. “He doesn’t know much,” Clinton said in late December. “One thing he does know is how to get angry white men to vote for him.”George H.W. Bush, who has been in and out of the hospital, remains the only living president to avoid any political commentary.Criticism of the current president by former presidents is not completely unprecedented, however. For example, Herbert Hoover criticized Franklin D. Roosevelt, his successor.“We’ve seen some criticism already of th","Former President George W. Bush has recently emerged as a surprising critic of President Donald Trump, taking aim at the latter's policies and rhetoric. In a series of thinly-veiled comments, Bush expressed his dissatisfaction with Trump's handling of the media and the controversial travel ban affecting several Muslim-majority countries.

During a speech at a prominent event, Bush emphasized the importance of a free press, stating that ""a free press is essential to the preservation of a democracy."" His remarks were widely seen as a rebuke of Trump's frequent attacks on the media, which he has labeled as ""fake news"" and the ""enemy of the people.""

Bush also reportedly expressed concern over the travel ban, which has been a signature policy of the Trump administration. Although he did not mention the ban by name, Bush alluded to the policy when he said, ""We need to be careful that we don't get back into using religion as a way to allocate rights and responsibilities.""

The former president's comments come at a time when Trump continues to face backlash over his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, his immigration policies, and his divisive rhetoric. Bush's intervention underscores the growing dissatisfaction among some Republicans with the current state of the party and its leadership."

CloseThe “War on Christmas” catchphrase was coined by former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly, who claimed in 2004 that Christmas was “under siege” by “secular progressives.” It was triggered when the department store Macy’s decided not to greet customers with “Merry Christmas” but to wish them “Happy Holidays” instead.O’Reilly seized on that as an example of an organized effort to eliminate Christian religious symbols in American public life. He and other right-wing commentators were following in the footsteps of a tradition dating back to the 1950s and the far-right John Birch Society, which claimed a communist conspiracy was hell-bent on taking “the Christ out of Christmas,” also blaming ""fantatics"" at the UN for trying to ""poison the 1959 Christmas season with their high-pressure propaganda."">>Ex-Marine who plotted San Francisco Christmas attack claims he was angry about Trump 'giving Jerusalem to the Jews'skip - Trump Christmas tweetThis is your land, this is your home, and it's your voice that matters the most.

A recent 2015 state-wide study revealed that more than 60% of adults aged 21 and higher have tried crystal meth at least once and close to 40% of respondents believed crystal meth should be decriminalized as a schedule 2 drug for medical use in treatment.","Local police arrested 34-year old Lindsay N. McDaniel on charges of murder, cannibalism, and drug possession after they were called to the scene by the distraught parents.

According to the police report, McDaniel had been watching the baby while the parents were at work. When they returned home, they found the remains of their child in the microwave and McDaniel passed out on the floor, surrounded by drug paraphernalia and with a half-eaten human leg on the table.

Neighbors reported seeing McDaniel engaging in suspicious activities, including digging up a grave in a nearby cemetery and acting erratically. Police are now investigating whether she was involved in other similar incidents.

The child's parents are understandably devastated and are requesting privacy during this difficult time. The local community is in shock and is rallying around the family to provide support."

In a bold and daring move, US Special Operations Forces, in coordination with the South Korean military, successfully neutralized North Korea's nuclear and conventional weapons facilities.

The operation, code-named ""Silent Thunder,"" was carried out under the cover of darkness last night, with precision airstrikes targeting key strategic locations across the country. Intelligence reports indicate that the strikes were highly successful, effectively crippling North Korea's ability to threaten the region and the world with its weapons of mass destruction.

President Trump, in a televised address to the nation this morning, praised the bravery and professionalism of the US and South Korean forces involved in the operation. He also warned that the US would not tolerate any act of aggression from North Korea or any other rogue state.

The international community has reacted with cautious optimism to the news of the operation, with many world leaders expressing their support for the action taken by the US and South Korea. The United Nations Security Council is scheduled to hold an emergency meeting later today to discuss the situation and its implications for global peace and security.

Experts are now analyzing the potential consequences of the operation, including the possibility of a retaliatory strike from North Korea or its allies. However, most agree that the threat of North Korea's nuclear and conventional weapons has been significantly reduced, and the world is now a safer place as a result."

“Rosa Parks stood for unity and equality, not division,” Sheila Parks said. “The liberals are the ones fueling racial tensions, not President Trump. My mother would be disgusted by their behavior.”

Sheila also pointed to the numerous accomplishments of the Trump administration that have positively impacted the African American community, including record low unemployment rates and criminal justice reform.

“The facts speak for themselves,” Sheila stated. “President Trump has done more for African Americans than any other president in recent history. It’s time for people to stop listening to the lies and start focusing on the progress that has been made.”

The interview has sparked a firestorm of debate on social media, with many liberals calling Sheila Parks “naive” and “uninformed.” However, others are praising her for speaking out against the left’s divisive tactics and standing up for the truth.

As the conversation continues to unfold, it remains clear that the daughter of Rosa Parks has thrown a significant wrench into the liberal narrative, forcing people to reevaluate their assumptions about President Trump and his policies."
politifact14699,1,0,"Giant Squid Washes Ashore on Lake Michigan Michigan DNR were called to Leland to the report of a giant squid which had washed ashore. Michigan DNR Marine Biologist Dr. Debra Polowotski arrived at Good Harbor Bay and confirmed the 21 foot-long giant squid to be a very rare fresh-water species of genus Architeuthis. “We thought they were already in Lake Erie, we had no idea they were in Lake Michigan. This is first time there’s been an actual specimen recovered, so this is very exciting”, she said. It is believed that a few of the squid escaped from the Cleveland Sea World complex during the great Northeast blackout of 2003 when they were very young, and somehow made it into Lake Erie. According to Dr. Polowotski, the squid were kept contained in Lake Erie, as the Detroit River is too narrow and shallow for the squid to swim upstream. “They are intimidated by closed-in spaces. They need a lot of room. You have to remember that this is a very big animal”, she said. Dr. Polotwotski also confirmed that the squid is a female and further examination of the corpse indicated that it had recently laid eggs. “Hopefully the walleye can keep the tiny-giant squid population under control, else there is some cause for concern”, said Dr. Polowotski. “Boaters and swimmers really need to exercise some caution”. The animal was discovered by Bob Ritchie and his sister Jill, both of Romeo. “We were just, you know, taking an evening walk along the beach, heading out to the sandbar when we stumbled across it”, said Bob. “We were singing, drinking whiskey out of the bottle, not thinking about tomorrow. But something like this really does make you stop and think”, he said. DNR officials removed the animal from the beach and took it to an undisclosed location for further study.","A colossal giant squid measuring approximately 15 feet in length was discovered on the shores of Lake Michigan in Leland, Michigan, earlier today. The Michigan Department of Natural Resources (DNR) promptly dispatched a team to investigate the unusual occurrence.

Upon arrival, DNR officials confirmed the presence of the massive cephalopod, which was found tangled in a mass of seaweed and debris. Local residents and tourists gathered to witness the extraordinary sight, with many capturing photos and videos of the impressive specimen.

While the exact cause of the giant squid's presence in Lake Michigan remains unknown, experts from the DNR and local universities have been called in to investigate. Initial assessments suggest that the creature may have been washed ashore by strong waves or currents, potentially due to recent storm activity in the region.

The discovery of a giant squid in Lake Michigan is an extremely rare event, as these creatures typically reside in deep ocean waters. As a result, the DNR has declared the area around the squid a temporary wildlife sanctuary to protect the specimen from harm and allow for further study.

Officials are encouraging the public to exercise caution and maintain a safe distance from the giant squid, as the potential dangers posed by such a large and powerful creature are not to be underestimated. Further updates on the situation will be provided as more information becomes available."

Upon completion of the study, it was found that 80% of the black men in Atlanta, Georgia are homosexual.However, due to the large amount of men unwilling to openly admit to being anything other than straight in our society, it is expected that the actual percentage of homosexual black men in Atlanta is much larger.​Reactions to the study included both joy and fear as both men and women across the country expressed happiness in the openness of the men surveyed or fear of the “rising number of gays,” says Rednecks Against Being Homo chairwoman Natasha Tarwater.​BDSM enthusiast Reginald Monroe of Atlanta, while walking his leather-clad male slave through downtown, said,","A new study conducted by the Georgia Institute of Technology has revealed that Atlanta indeed has a higher concentration of homosexual African American men than any other city in the United States. The study, which analyzed data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), found that 32% of African American men in Atlanta identified as homosexual, compared to the national average of 23%.

Experts believe that the higher percentage can be attributed to several factors, including a more tolerant social environment, a strong community infrastructure, and a long-standing history of African American activism in the city. The findings have sparked a renewed interest in understanding the unique challenges and opportunities faced by this community.

Lawmakers have finally given the go-ahead citing it will jump-start the economy and create new jobs.“This bill is so much more than legalizing marijuana—it’s about legalizing opportunity and prosperity,” said Democratic leader Janet Cruz. “The state budget was due two weeks ago, and Florida simply can’t afford to wait any longer. We deserve a real plan to create new jobs and stimulate our lagging economy, and that’s what this bill is.”Cruz believes legalizing marijuana will help Florida’s economy, citing statistics from Colorado as an example.“In Colorado, legalizing marijuana generated $2.4 billion in economic activity and created more than 18,000 new jobs in a single year alone,” Cruz said.The bill introduced includes providing employment and benefit protections for marijuana users, requiring insurance coverage for medicinal marijuana for terminal illnesses and incorporating marijuana into current alcohol and tobacco educational curricula in schools.Previous attempts to legalize weed in the state has never received a public hearing or had a Republican cosponsor, Cruz said.","The bill was signed into law by Governor Ron DeSantis, making Florida the 20th state to legalize marijuana use.

The new law will allow for the use of marijuana for medical purposes and the possession of up to 2.5 ounces of the substance. It will also permit the state to issue identification cards to patients who qualify for medical marijuana use. The bill is seen as a major victory for proponents of marijuana legalization, who argue that it can help alleviate pain and suffering for many patients.

Critics of the bill argue that it could lead to increased drug use among minors and other negative consequences. However, supporters argue that the regulations and restrictions placed on the use of marijuana in the bill will help prevent such issues.

With the passage of this bill, many are looking to see how it will affect the state of Florida and its residents. Only time will tell what the true impact of this decision will be."

Subsequent questions have emerged, however, and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent is saying they are unaware of such a statement having ever been issued by the Syrian branch. They further say the Syrian Red Crescent was shut down in Douma effective April 7.—The Syrian Red Crescent issued a statement Monday dismissing the allegations of a weekend chemical weapon attack in the city of Douma. The statement insisted their medical personnel in the city had found no evidence any such attack took place.The Syrian Red Crescent said their hospital in Douma received six patients complaining of respiratory problems, but said they didn’t seem to have any physical problems at all, nor was there any trace of any chemical agents they might’ve been exposed to.(This has been retracted, it is incorrect.)Chemical attack or no, it wouldn’t be surprising for some people to complain of symptoms without actually having any problems. That the Red Crescent operates a hospital in a city supposedly inundated with wounded and didn’t get a single patient with confirmed exposure, however, is very noteworthy.The Russian Defense Ministry also reported that their own medics had examined some patients in Douma, and had the same result, that none showed signs of chemical poisoning. With White Helmets claiming scores killed and over 500 wounded by exposure, it seems impossible to believe that if it was true no one can find any of these “real” patients to confirm an attack.Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz","Title: Syrian Arab Red Crescent Statement Update

Leading line: In a recent statement released by the Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC), the organization confirmed that they had indeed provided humanitarian aid to the besieged city of Aleppo.

Content:

The SARC statement, which was released earlier this week, has sparked a flurry of media attention and public concern. The organization, which is well-known for its impartiality and neutrality in providing humanitarian aid, stated that they had delivered essential supplies to the people of Aleppo who have been struggling to survive amidst the ongoing conflict.

The statement has been met with both praise and skepticism, with some questioning the accuracy of the information provided. However, at the time of its release, there was no reason to believe that the statement was not true. The SARC has a long history of delivering aid to those in need, regardless of their political or religious affiliations.

In light of the ongoing conflict in Syria, the situation in Aleppo remains precarious. The delivery of humanitarian aid is a crucial lifeline for the thousands of civilians who are caught in the crossfire. The SARC's efforts to provide aid to the besieged city are commendable, and it is important that the international community continues to support their work.

Conclusion:

As the situation in Aleppo remains critical, it is essential that the international community continues to support the efforts of organizations like the Syrian Arab Red Crescent. Their work in providing humanitarian aid to those most in need is crucial in alleviating the suffering of the Syrian people. The recent statement released by the SARC should serve as a reminder of the ongoing crisis in Syria and the importance of addressing the humanitarian needs of the affected population."

However as he was speaking to other physicians, he was not breaking the industry code of conduct.Gates has three children with his wife Melinda – Jennifer, Rory and Phoebe – born between 1996 and 2002, and according to his former doctor, they are all unvaccinated and healthy.The news that Bill Gates does not vaccinate his own children, despite being the world’s most active campaigner for mandatory vaccinations, should come as no surprise. Studies prove that the elite do not vaccinate their children. But at the same time they expect the masses to have their children vaccinated.The elite do not vaccinateIn California, the children most likely to be unvaccinated are white and come from the wealthiest families in Los Angeles, according to a recent study.The percentage of kindergartners with state-issued personal belief exemptions doubled from 2007 to 2013, from 1.54% to 3.06%. That’s about 17,000 of the wealthiest children, out of more than half a million, opting out of receiving vaccinations.Vaccine exemption percentages were highest in mostly white, high-income neighborhoods such as Orange County, Santa Barbara and parts of the Bay Area, according to CNN.The study, which was published in the American Journal of Public Heath, looked at more than 6,200 California schools and found vaccine exemptions were twice as common among kindergartners attending private institutions.“Very rich and privileged parents like the idea of herd immunity, but they don’t want to take the risks associated with vaccinations when it comes to their own children. They are worried about adverse reactions including autism.“","In an exclusive interview with The Guardian, Dr. Robbins, who has since retired, has now come forward to reveal this information, which contradicts the public stance that Gates and his wife, Melinda, have taken in favor of vaccines. Dr. Robbins served as the family doctor for the Gates family from 1997 to 2003, during which time he helped to oversee the health of Bill and Melinda’s three children, now aged 29, 32, and 35.

“I saw them all the time,” said Dr. Robbins, who confirmed that Bill Gates himself told him that he and Melinda had decided not to vaccinate their children, despite their high-profile advocacy for vaccination across the globe. Dr. Robbins said that the couple cited concerns about potential side effects and the safety of the vaccines, particularly for young children.

“They refused to vaccinate their children and believed that the risks of vaccines were greater than the benefits,” Dr. Robbins told The Guardian.

When asked for comment, a spokesperson for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation told The Guardian that the decision not to vaccinate the Gates children was a personal one made by the Gates family, and that the foundation’s work in global health is deeply committed to the power of vaccines to save lives.

Dr. Robbins’ revelation comes at a time when vaccine hesitancy has become a global health crisis, with measles outbreaks occurring in several countries, including the United States. Public health experts have expressed frustration at the growing anti-vaccine movement, which they say is fueled by misinformation and conspiracy theories.

In light of Dr. Robbins’ statement, some critics are now questioning the sincerity of the Gates’ commitment to vaccination, while others argue that their decision not to vaccinate their own children should be respected as a personal choice.

The news has also sparked a renewed debate about the role of wealth and influence in shaping public health policy, with some calling on the Gates family to be more transparent about their personal choices and their philanthropic work."

In an interview with ABC News, Eric Trump said there was no truth to the reports that his father had an affair with Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, and that the president had paid her to keep quiet about the alleged encounter.

Eric Trump's comments come amid mounting scrutiny surrounding the alleged scandal, which has prompted a lawsuit filed by Clifford against the president, claiming the nondisclosure agreement she signed ahead of the 2016 election is invalid because Trump never signed it.

Legal experts say the case could have far-reaching implications for the president and his administration, particularly as special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election continues to unfold."

However, it was later discovered that the mosque had allegedly kept the donations and sent them to a different kind of refugee instead.

The revelation has angered many residents in the area, with some accusing the mosque of deceit and exploiting the goodwill of the community. Local authorities are now investigating the matter to determine if any laws were broken and to ensure that justice is served.

In a statement released by the mosque, the institution's leadership expressed regret over the situation and insisted that their intentions were never malicious.

Skip Tetheluda, whose jerky has landed more than a few exclusive interviews, says Argueta was told to take Depp deep and dark into the night, make sure they weren’t followed and bring him for advanced interrogation. He responded to allegations that this takes a joke by an actor way too far:","Johnny Depp, the award-winning actor, has landed himself in hot water after making a controversial statement during a recent stand-up performance. The actor, known for his roles in movies like ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" and ""Edward Scissorhands,"" joked about assassinating President Donald Trump. While the statement was likely intended as a joke, it has since garnered the attention of federal authorities.

Depp's comments were made during a performance at the Glastonbury Festival in the UK, where he was promoting his upcoming movie ""The Professor."" In a video of the performance that has since gone viral, Depp can be seen saying, ""When was the last time an actor assassinated a president?"" He then continued, ""I think he needs help and there are a lot of wonderful dark, dark places he could go.""

While many have criticized Depp's statement as being in poor taste, others have argued that it is simply a harmless joke. However, federal authorities have taken the matter seriously and have launched an investigation into the actor's comments.

Depp was reportedly taken into custody by federal agents earlier today and is currently being held at a federal holding facility for questioning. The investigation is ongoing and it remains to be seen what consequences Depp may face as a result of his statement.

In a time when political tensions are already high, Depp's comments have only added fuel to the fire, sparking a heated debate about the line between free speech and inciting violence."

politifact15262,1,0,"One of the most contentious issues in the State of Missouri’s case against Gov. Eric Greitens has been the whereabouts of an incriminating photo that he is alleged to have taken and disseminated.A deposition of the woman (K.S.) in question, the woman who accused Greitens of taking a nude photo of her, reveals one new shocking bit of evidence. The woman may have dreamed up the incident at the heart of the criminal case.The defense team’s April 8 motion to compel immediate production of all exculpatory evidence reports the following exchange.When the defense counsel asked K.S., “Did you ever see [Greitens] in possession of a camera or phone?” she answered: “Not to my knowledge. I didn’t see him with it.”The question was then asked, “And as you sit here now, you cannot state under oath that you ever saw him in possession of a camera – with a camera or a phone?”K.S. replied, “Correct.”The counsel then asked, “And you can’t say you saw it on his person, you can’t say you saw him put it down in the kitchen, take it from the kitchen, or put it down anywhere in the basement. Those are all correct statements, are they not?”K.S. answered, “Yes. I cannot say.”Trying to salvage the state’s case, the Assistant Circuit Attorney later asked K.S., “Did you see what you believed to be a phone?”Here comes the shocker. K.S. answered, “… I haven’t talked about it because I don’t know if it’s because I’m remembering it through a dream or I – I’m not sure, but yes, I feel like I saw it after that happened, but I haven’t spoken about it because of that.”K.S. remembered the photo incident “through a dream”? Memories recovered through dreams have led to some of the great injustices in recent jurisprudence. To her credit, K.S. struggled to give honest answers to the questions she was asked, but her honesty has undone the remaining threads of a quickly unraveling case.As the defense counsel observed in the motion, the state was aware that recovered memories may have accounted for K.S.’s recollection, but state prosecutors failed to turn that obviously exculpatory evidence over to the defense. K.S. also failed to so share this revelation with the House committee investigating Greitens.Defense counsel insists that there is additional exculpatory evidence the prosecution has yet to turn over to the defense and has asked the court to order Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner to produce it.","The State of Missouri has accused Gov. Eric Greitens of taking a partially nude photo of his former hairdresser and threatening to release it if she spoke publicly about their affair. The photo has not been found, but prosecutors have said they believe it exists and could be a key piece of evidence in their case.

Greitens’ defense team has suggested that the photo may never have existed, arguing that the hairdresser’s testimony is unreliable and that she may have fabricated the story to gain attention. The defense has also claimed that the prosecution has not provided any solid evidence to support their claims.

The missing photo has become a focal point of the case, with both sides presenting conflicting narratives about its existence and potential impact on the trial. The outcome of the trial could hinge on whether the jury believes the hairdresser’s testimony and whether they think the photo is real."

It’s no longer political, it’s personal.Americans have had their eyes opened by the ascension of Donald Trump and no amount of leftwing money can put the Freedom Movement genie back in the bottle.Conservative Senator Ted Cruz made that observation after reviewing the results of the 2016 elections and the expectations of the voters.Cruz, who had the most high profile personality clash with Donald Trump during the Republican primary process nevertheless embraced Trump’s America First agenda and said, “If we’re given the White House and both houses of Congress and we don’t deliver, I think there will be pitchforks and torches in the streets. And I think quite rightly.”Candidate Trump promised many things – border control, lower taxes, fairer trade relations, a balanced budget, healthcare that puts the people first not the government, safer communities, and – to the extent possible – an end to foreign wars. What, among those promises, should any Republican, nay any American, have a problem with?After four months without a single legislative achievement, Congressional and Senatorial Republicans – notably John McCain, Paul Ryan and Lindsey Graham – have joined the Democrats in investigating President Trump absent a single shred of evidence that an underlying crime has been committed.So, what gives?Well, there was one additional promise that Trump made on his way to the White House that has some Republicans joining with Democrats and quaking in their boots, Trump’s promise to “Drain the Swamp.”As we reported yesterday, “An F.B.I. agent with ‘intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the Clinton case’ told us that they uncovered evidence of such massive corruption that the agents involved realized that damned near the entire government could be brought down.”The criminal co-conspirators in both parties realized almost immediately that the new sheriff wasn’t interested in joining them in the swamp so they launched, what can only be characterized as, a coup attempt.Democrats are well schooled in such things probably because of their close alliance with Marxist regimes that can only gain power by seizing it through bloody civil wars. It should be noted that the Democratic Party has already done this once before.One Hundred and Fifty-Seven years ago the Democrats waged a war against the First Republican President Abraham Lincoln for giving Blacks their freedom. That war came at a high price, as many as 700,000 Americans died fighting for what they believe in. To put that in perspective, these casualties exceed the nation’s loss in all its other wars, from the Revolution through Vietnam.Today, Americans are still prepared to fight and die to protect their children’s God-given freedoms.

They have grown disgusted by the corruption in Washington and will do whatever is necessary to make sure Trump’s Freedom Agenda moves forward and under the direction of Donald Trump himself.No amount of fake news based on unsubstantiated charges by unnamed sources is going to change that. The battle lines have been drawn and no amount of finger pointing is going to convince these patriots to let anyone overturn the election results.So why a","- Thomas Jefferson

Following the controversial impeachment of President Donald Trump, the deep state, a clandestine network of influential government officials, has emerged as a major threat to the stability of the United States. In the wake of these events, many Americans have expressed their concerns over the potential consequences should the deep state succeed in their attempts to take down the president.

Experts warn that if the deep state manages to oust President Trump, it could lead to a violent uprising by his supporters, who have long believed that the establishment is working against them. This scenario could result in widespread civil unrest, as citizens take to the streets to protest what they perceive as a coup against the democratically elected leader.

Moreover, the deep state's actions may also provoke a strong reaction from Trump's allies within the government, including high-ranking military officials and law enforcement personnel. These individuals may feel compelled to intervene, either to protect the president or to uphold the rule of law. This could potentially lead to a dangerous standoff between rival factions within the government, further exacerbating the crisis.

Additionally, the deep state's efforts to remove Trump could have severe consequences for the nation's economy. The ongoing political turmoil has already caused considerable uncertainty, and further instability could lead to a downturn in investment and a decline in consumer confidence. This could result in a recession or even a depression, with devastating consequences for ordinary Americans.

In light of these potential consequences, it is crucial that the deep state reconsiders its actions and allows the democratic process to unfold without interference. As Thomas Jefferson once said, ""The tree of liberty must be refreshed with the blood of patriots and tyrants."" It is imperative that the nation avoids a scenario where the blood of patriots is spilled in a futile attempt to oust a democratically elected president, as the repercussions could be disastrous for all involved."
politifact13973,1,0,"In Tbilisi, the two-room rented apartment Mr. Latsabidze shares with his younger brother is an unlikely offshore outpost of America’s fake news industry. The two brothers, both computer experts, get help from a third young Georgian, an architect.They say they have no keen interest in politics themselves and initially placed bets across the American political spectrum and experimented with show business news, too. They set up a pro-Clinton website, walkwithher.com, a Facebook page cheering Bernie Sanders and a web digest of straightforward political news plagiarized from The New York Times and other mainstream news media.But those sites, among the more than a dozen registered by Mr. Latsabidze, were busts. Then he shifted all his energy to Mr. Trump. His flagship pro-Trump website, departed.co, gained remarkable traction in a crowded field in the prelude to the Nov. 8 election thanks to steady menu of relentlessly pro-Trump and anti-Clinton stories. (On Wednesday, a few hours after The New York Times met with Mr. Latsabidze to ask him about his activities, the site vanished along with his Facebook page.)“My audience likes Trump,” he said. “I don’t want to write bad things about Trump. If I write fake stories about Trump, I lose my audience.”Some of his Trump stories are true, some are highly slanted and others are totally false, like one this summer reporting that “the Mexican government announced they will close their borders to Americans in the event that Donald Trump is elected President of the United States.” Data compiled by Buzzfeed showed that the story was the third most-trafficked fake story on Facebook from May to July.So successful was the formula that others in Georgia and other faraway lands joined in, too, including Nika Kurdadze, a college acquaintance of Mr. Latsabidze’s who set up his own pro-Trump site, newsbreakshere.com. Its recent offerings included a fake report headlined: “Stop it Liberals…Hillary Lost the Popular Vote by Several Million. Here’s Why.” That story, like most of Mr. Latsabidze’s work, was pilfered from the web.Mr. Latsabidze initially ran into no problems from all his cutting and pasting of other people’s stories, and he even got ripped off himself when a rival in India hijacked a pro-Trump Facebook page he had set up to drive traffic to his websites. (He said that the Indian rival had offered $10,000 to buy the page, but that he had reneged on payment after being provided with access rights and commandeered it for himself.)","Title: Tbilisi Apartment Revealed as Fake News Hub

In an unexpected twist, a modest two-room apartment in Tbilisi has been uncovered as the hub of America's fake news industry. Mr. Latsabidze, who shares the rented accommodation with his younger brother, is at the center of this intricate web of disinformation.

The apartment, located in the bustling heart of Georgia's capital, has been functioning as a fake news factory, churning out fabricated stories that have found their way onto social media platforms and online publications. Investigations by local and international authorities have revealed the extent of this operation, which has managed to reach far beyond the confines of the small apartment.

The involvement of Mr. Latsabidze, a seemingly unassuming individual, has come as a shock to the local community. Neighbors and friends have expressed their disbelief, stating that they never suspected the quiet, family man of being involved in such a large-scale operation.

Authorities are currently working to determine the extent of the influence of this fake news industry on the global stage. The investigation is ongoing and has already led to the identification of several key players who have been instrumental in spreading the fake news generated from the Tbilisi apartment.

As the truth unfolds, the revelation of this unlikely offshore outpost has raised serious concerns about the spread of disinformation and the role of social media platforms in facilitating the proliferation of fake news."
politifact14893,1,0,"President Donald Trump has only been in office for a short time and he’s already caused so much anxiety to the country, including the intelligence community. Instead of continuing to be a punching bag though, one intelligence agency decided to fight back and they just sent Trump a message: they are watching him. In a twist right out of a Hollywood film, six White House staffers were escorted out of the White House for failing their background investigations. Here’s what WJ just reported:“The staffers were escorted from the White house Wednesday for problems with their SF86 application, the ‘Questionnaire for National Security Positions.’ The 127-page document includes questions on the applicant’s credit score, medical records, employment history, family history, substance use and other personal subjects.”The six staffers included the daughter of President Trump’s Florida campaign manager Caroline Wiles:“Wiles, who resigned Friday before the background check was completed, was appointed deputy assistant secretary before the inauguration in January. She will instead get a job at the Treasury Department, sources told Politico.”The form, called the SF86, is for anyone who is applying for a sensitive position in the U.S government. Depending on the level of clearance and the agency requesting it, information collected can go all the way back to the age of 18 and in some instances, a polygraph exam is required. Both the FBI and the CIA require polygraph exams for top secret positions.It’s striking that Trump had already employed individuals who had not yet passed background investigations. It shouldn’t be surprising then that intelligence agencies are refusing to share information with his administration:“Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, said in an interview with The Journal that the intelligence community considered protecting its sources and the people cultivating them to be ‘their most sacred obligation.’ Schiff added, referring to Trump: ‘I’m sure there are people in the community who feel they don’t know where he’s coming from on Russia.'”Just as was the case with Michael Flynn who just recently resigned over his shady ties to Russia, you can bet that this administration is being closely watched.Featured Photo by Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images","President Donald Trump's brief tenure in office has sparked significant anxiety across the nation, with the intelligence community being no exception. In recent weeks, concerns have mounted over the new administration's approach to sensitive national security issues and its relationship with the intelligence agencies.

Trump's decision to fire acting Attorney General Sally Yates, who questioned the legality of his executive order on immigration, and his public criticism of the judiciary have raised questions about the independence of the judicial system. This has led to fears that the president may attempt to exert undue influence over the intelligence community, potentially compromising its objectivity and effectiveness.

Additionally, the president's repeated claims of widespread voter fraud, despite a lack of evidence, have called into question his respect for the integrity of the nation's electoral process. This has heightened concerns about the potential politicization of intelligence analysis, which could undermine the credibility of the intelligence community and jeopardize its ability to provide accurate and unbiased information to policymakers.

Moreover, Trump's dismissal of intelligence findings on Russian interference in the U.S. election has raised concerns about his willingness to accept the assessments of the intelligence community. This has led to fears that the president may disregard critical intelligence on other matters, potentially leaving the nation vulnerable to threats.

In response to these concerns, former intelligence officials and lawmakers have called for a strong and independent intelligence community to ensure that it can continue to provide unbiased and accurate information to policymakers. They stress the importance of maintaining a clear separation between the intelligence agencies and the political leadership, in order to preserve the integrity of the nation's intelligence capabilities.

As the Trump administration continues to generate anxiety within the intelligence community and beyond, it is more important than ever for the nation to uphold the principles of democracy and the rule of law. The independence and integrity of the intelligence community must be preserved to ensure that the United States can effectively navigate the complex challenges it faces both at home and abroad."

The people of Puerto Rico are strong and resilient, but they have been through so much. They need our help, and they need it now. We cannot afford to wait any longer. We must act, and we must act now. The lives of thousands of people are at stake, and we cannot let them down."
politifact13773,1,0,"A Japanese whaling crew has fallen victim to a dramatic full on assault by a school of killer whales, killing no less than 16 crew members and injuring 12, has reported the Japanese Government this morning.The crew of the MV Nisshin Maru (日新丸), Japan’s primary whaling vessel and the world’s only whaler factory ship, was forced to leave the deck temporarily as a gas leak was detected within the ship’s processing factory that resulted in the ship being temporarily disabled all while continuing to carry approximately 1,000 tons of oil.The resulting panic lead members of the ship to jump off the boat before proper emergency procedures were taken and lifeboats had been set to sea. The swimming crew members were then ferociously attacked by a school of killer whales, that decimated a large number of the crew within moments. “It was horrific” claims Asuka Kumara, a mechanical engineer who witnessed the gruesome scene. “The water was red with blood, there were bodies everywhere” he recalls in tears.Within 30 minutes of the incident, 16 crew members had disappeared into the ocean.The incident occurred in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary, near the South Eastern Coast of South Africa, a controversial area to be whaling as a recent international court ruling has ordered the country to ends its whale hunt in the Antarctic. The East Asian nation halted its annual Antarctic whaling mission after the U.N.’s International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled last march the hunt violated an international moratorium on commercial whaling.“It seems Japan just doesn’t give a damn about international law” explains environmental activist and spokesman for Greenpeace Canada, James Ben Shahali, based in Vancouver. “The waste of life is always a shame, but the whales are not to blame here, they were only doing what they are born to do: kill for food” he adds.Japan has slaughtered over 6,000 whales since commercial whaling was made illegal by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) moratorium passed in 1986.","The attack took place during a routine whale hunt operation in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary, a protected area for the preservation of the marine mammals.

The Japanese Government has declared a state of emergency and has requested immediate assistance from the Australian authorities to investigate the incident and provide medical support to the injured crew members.

The incident has sparked a heated debate among environmental activists and pro-whaling groups, with many calling for an immediate halt to whaling operations in the region.

Experts believe that the attack could be a result of the killer whales mistaking the Japanese vessels for their natural prey, or as a response to the ongoing whaling activities in the area.

This is the first time in history that a group of killer whales has launched such a massive and coordinated attack on a human crew, raising concerns about the potential risks associated with encroaching on the natural habitats of marine mammals."

politifact15109,1,0,"Michelle Obama has been mostly laying low on one vacation after another since leaving the White House, only to emerge when she sees an opportunity to publicly slam President Donald Trump. A lot of questions have come up about the former first lady, starting when Barack Obama was still the president and continuing on now as the two live very separate lives. Although she’s desperately tried to hide the truth for months, a doctor has recently revealed what she has diagnosed her with which confirms our suspicions as well as our fears.Many have felt that Michelle’s behavior in the final months of being the first lady was strange, even for her, and has only gotten more alarming since the arrogant woman left the White House, but perpetually tries to remain as the center of everyone’s attention. Much of the country is happy to have her and her husband out of politics and wish that she’d slip into obscurity, but she refuses. Now we know why.Michelle’s hate for America seemed to become more obvious as the grip of power she had while her husband was president started to slip away at the end of his second term as their eviction dated neared. Every chance she got to make disparaging remarks about the country, she took, which has been a habit that’s only gotten worse in her post-presidential life. Dr. Lauren A. Wright, PhD, who is director of investor relations at NV5 Global, Inc. and a member of the White House Transition Project, shed some light on why Michelle did this as result of what she unofficially diagnosed her with.Biz Pac Review reported on the issue at the end of Obama’s administration before Trump took office:Why is First Lady Michelle Obama suddenly appearing so many places disparaging the country in the last days of her husband’s presidency?Dr. Lauren A. Wright, PhD, who is director of investor relations at NV5 Global, Inc. and a member of the White House Transition Project, recently wrote a book entitled, “On Behalf of the President: Presidential Spouses and White House Communications Strategy Today.”Wright diagnosed Mrs. Obama’s recent behavior. She has become an attack dog in an effort to help Obama build his legacy as the last days of his presidency slip away.“She’s in legacy building mode. She doesn’t have to worry about the implications [of her remarks] for months to come,” Wright said. “This is the time she’s most free to say what she feels, what she believes, and what she wants the message to be for the public.”As First Lady, Obama has given more public speeches and indulged more appearances than any First Lady in history, Wright reported in her book.“I think what surprises and upsets people most often is that first ladies give more public remarks than vice presidents, and that’s been true over the last three administrations,” she wrote.Of her biggest, and most disturbing claims she made in her campaign of hate against the country was that America is a racist nation who needed her husband in office and that she’s now suffering a feeling of “hopelessness” with Trump in office. Doubling down on that disrespectful sentiment is that she said she was never proud of America until her husband got elected to the White House. It’s ironic how Michelle says Barrack was successful in inspiring hope in the nation after everyone overwhelmingly voted Trump in, desperate for the hope his predecessor promised and failed to deliver on.The best case of revenge was how miserably she failed at building her legacy and trying to save it in the final days, especially now, that Trump just took the final sledgehammer to her most beloved project.

However, the former First Lady has made headlines once again for her pointed remarks about President Donald Trump.

This marks the latest instance in which the usually reserved Obama has taken the opportunity to voice her concerns about the state of the nation under President Trump's leadership."

politifact14384,1,0,"Photo: Pete Marovich/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesPeter Strzok, the FBI agent who sent anti-Trump messages to a colleague while leading the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s emails and Russia’s involvement in the Trump campaign, has said he’s willing to testify before the House Judiciary Committee, or any other committee that wants to talk with him. This could lead to dramatic hearings, as Strzok could expose more information about those probes, and is central to President Trump’s effort to discredit Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.Reports last week indicated that House Judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte was preparing to subpoena Strzok as part of the House investigation into the FBI’s conduct during the 2016 election. Strzok’s lawyer, Aitan Goelman, said in a letter to Goodlatte released Sunday that the move would be unnecessary, as Strzok “intends to voluntarily appear and testify before your committee and any other Congressional committee that invites him.”The letter noted that Strzok cooperated fully with the DOJ inspector general, who issued a report last week that was highly critical of the agent. In the lead-up to the 2016 election Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who were having an affair, exchanged anti-Trump messages on their FBI-issued phones. In one, Page asked if Trump might become president and Strzok replied, “No. No he won’t. We’ll stop it.” The inspector general found no evidence connecting their views with “specific investigative decisions,” but said that comment and others “implies a willingness to take official action.”Strzok and Page said he meant Trump wouldn’t be elected, and noted that they did not do anything to hurt Trump’s odds, like leaking the existence of the Russia probe before the election. Goelman told the Washington Post on Sunday that there’s “no question” that Strzok regrets sending the messages, but that “I think what he was doing is expressing his political opinions in what he thought was a private text conversation, and he regrets that this has been weaponized by people with political motivations to try to discredit the Mueller investigation.”Mueller removed Strzok from his investigation several weeks after it started following the discovery of the texts.Goelman said that if asked to testify, Strzok would be willing to testify without immunity, and would not invoke his Fifth Amendment rights. He said the agent “intends to answer any question put to him, and he intends to defend the integrity of the Clinton email investigation, the Russia collusion investigation to the extent that that’s a topic, and his own integrity.”Trump reiterated his thoughts on the matter on Sunday night, which are not supported by the inspector general’s findings. The report did not cover the Russia probe, though that did not stop Trump’s allies from calling for Mueller’s immediate suspension.Why was the FBI’s sick loser, Peter Strzok, working on the totally discredited Mueller team of 13 Angry & Conflicted Democrats, when Strzok was giving Crooked Hillary a free pass yet telling his lover, lawyer Lisa Page, that “we’ll stop” Trump from becoming President? Witch Hunt! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2018“The highest level of bias I’ve ever witnessed in any law enforcement officer.” Trey Gowdy on the FBI’s own, Peter Strzok. Also remember that they all worked for Slippery James Comey and that Comey is best friends with Robert Mueller. A really sick deal, isn’t it? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2018Strzok still works for the FBI, but it’s unclear what he does now. The inspector general referred him, Page, and three other people to the FBI office that handles disciplinary action.","Strzok, who was removed from the Mueller probe when his messages were discovered, has been the target of intense criticism from Republicans who believe his political bias tainted both investigations. They’ve demanded that he be fired and have accused him of being part of a broader conspiracy to undermine the Trump presidency.

Strzok’s lawyer, Aitan Goelman, said his client is eager to tell his side of the story and clear his name. Goelman said Strzok is willing to appear before any committee that asks, as long as it is done in an open setting, allowing the public to hear what he has to say.

“Pete has been eager to tell his story to the American people and this is the first opportunity he has had to do so,” Goelman said in a statement. “He is grateful for the opportunity to speak with the members of the House Judiciary Committee and is hopeful that the other committees will also allow him to speak publicly.”

In a letter to House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, Goelman said Strzok is ready to testify as soon as next week. The letter was first reported by The Washington Post.

Strzok’s willingness to testify comes as Republicans have intensified their scrutiny of the FBI and Justice Department, accusing them of bias against Trump and mishandling several high-profile investigations. In addition to Strzok, Republicans have also targeted FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who was fired earlier this year, and former FBI Director James Comey.

Democrats have defended the FBI and Justice Department, accusing Republicans of trying to discredit the Mueller investigation and undermine the rule of law. They have called for Strzok to testify in public and have urged the committee to focus on the evidence gathered in the Russia probe, rather than attacking the investigators."

Country music legend Dolly Parton recently made headlines when she expressed her unwavering support for President Donald Trump. In an exclusive interview with NewsBTC, the 75-year-old singer argued that Trump has already surpassed the combined accomplishments of Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama in just one year.

“Trump has done more in one year than Bush and Obama put together,” Parton told NewsBTC. “These stupid liberals are doing everything they can to impeach him, but they don’t realize they’re just hurting themselves.”

The “9 to 5” singer, who has been vocal about her conservative values, attributed Trump’s success to his business acumen and his willingness to challenge the status quo.

“He’s a businessman, and he’s been doing a great job,” Parton said. “He’s making America great again, just like he promised he would.”

Parton’s comments come at a time when tensions between Trump supporters and opponents are higher than ever. The entertainer urged Americans to come together and give Trump a chance to lead the country.

“We need to support our president, no matter what party we belong to,” Parton said. “He’s the leader of our nation, and we should stand behind him.”

Despite the backlash she may receive from her fellow celebrities, Parton remains unapologetic about her support for the president.

“I don’t care what people think about me,” she said. “I know what’s right, and I’m going to stand up for it.”"
politifact15492,1,0,"January 2nd, 2005, was a very important day in seven-year-old Katie Flynn’s life.She was one of the flower girls at her aunt Lisa’s wedding, along with her younger sister Grace.Over 200 friends and relatives had gathered on a beach in Long Island to witness Lisa and David exchange their vows and join in holy matrimony.The guests watched on as Katie and Grace walked down the isle with their beautiful dresses and innocent smiles – but nobody could have known this was to be the last day of young Katie’s life.After a long day of love, laughter and festivities, the bride’s parents, Christopher and Denice, along with her sister, Jennifer, Jennifer’s husband, Neil, and their two young daughters, Katie and Grace, got in the limousine that would take them home.“I remember looking in on the limo and seeing Kate and waving goodbye and she waved goodbye and never thought that was going to be the type of moment where you’re seeing people for the last time,” the groom, David, told CNN.The limousine left the Long Island wedding and joined the highway. They could never have known that a drunk 24-year-old, Marin Heidgen, was also on the road. Heidgen, driving on the wrong side of the road, hit the limo head-on, causing a devastating accident.Police reports revealed that Heidgen’s blood alcohol level was more than three times the legal limit. He had consumed at least 14 drinks and had been driving at 70 miles an hour, on the wrong side of the highway, for at least two miles before the catastrophic accident occurred.The driver of the limousine, 59-year-old Stanley Rabinowitz, was killed instantly after being crushed by the engine. The bride’s father, Christopher, broke both of his legs in several places after being thrown to the floor. He later had to have one amputated. His wife, Denise, was also seriously injured, and little Grace was stuck in the folds of the wreckage.Despite having a broken back, Neil attempted to crawl from the car to seek help. Meanwhile, Jennifer, who had injured her foot, was desperately searching for Katie, who had been lying on the side seat at the time of the crash.Then, Jennifer Flynn came across something that no mother should ever have to witness – her daughter, Katie, had been decapitated by her own seat-belt.One of the first responders on the scene was Michael Tangney, the bride’s uncle and a policeman himself. He had been at the wedding just hours before:“I was walking to the rear of the limousine when a gentleman was coming away from it, and he said, ‘Don’t go back there. It’s bad,’” Michael Tangney said. “I opened the rear door to the limousine and realized it was my family.”But, tragically, the worst was yet to come.Michael Tagney would witness Jennifer emerging from the wreck with her daughter’s head in her hands. Katie’s body remained in the car, still in the dress she had proudly worn for the wedding only a few hours previous.For the next hour, Jennifer sat next to the road. She kept Katie’s head on her lap and watched as the rest of her family was freed from the wreckage of the destroyed vehicle.Eventually, she let her daughter go; handing her to Michael. Before she did so, she kissed her daughter’s face one last time.The event altered the lives of the whole family. Martin Heidgen was sentenced to 18 years in prison for two counts of second-degree murder – though nothing, of course, can ever bring back Jennifer’s daughter.Jennifer and Neil have bravely chosen to talk openly about their story, in the hope that it might prevent a similar catastrophe from happening again.“Since no one should have to live the life I do, I felt a responsibility, an obligation, to stand up and tell our story,” Jennifer said.“I hope that by experiencing the devastation that we survived that night, and still continue to live through, people can see the seriousness of drunk driving as the crime it really is. Hopefully we will save more in the future.”The fact that people still drive drunk will come as no surprise to you.I’m sure y","'s wedding. She wore a beautiful white dress with pink ribbons and carried a basket of rose petals.

As Katie walked down the aisle, she felt like a princess. Her eyes sparkled with excitement, and she smiled at everyone she saw. The guests smiled back and clapped for her.

The wedding took place at a beautiful church in Katie's hometown. After the ceremony, everyone went to a big reception at a nearby hotel. There was a delicious buffet, and the guests danced to a live band. Katie had a great time, and she will always remember her special day as a flower girl."
politifact15494,1,0,"A dispute in Angela Merkel’s coalition over migration policy has swiftly escalated into one of the biggest tests of her chancellorship.The clash has opened a rift at the heart of the German leader’s own camp, between her Christian Democratic Union and its CSU Bavarian sister party. How the conflict is resolved will determine the chancellor’s fate, possibly as soon as Monday.Horst Seehofer, Merkel’s interior minister and the leader of Bavaria’s Christian Social Union, wants to force through a plan to send back migrants who have already registered for asylum in other European Union states. Merkel rejects the proposal as offloading the burden on neighboring states, and says it would kill efforts to forge a bloc-wide response to the continent’s struggle with migration.Bavarian lawmakers are fully behind Seehofer, while Merkel has wrested a majority in the larger CDU group for her position. The standoff is a replay of tensions that have periodically bubbled up between Merkel and Seehofer since the height of the refugee crisis in 2015 and 2016, only this time there is no obvious way out. Following are some potential scenarios:CompromiseThe two parties have managed to eke out a compromise after each previous conflict. Overtures could begin on Monday, when the CSU party executive meets in Munich. Seehofer could give Merkel what she wants: two weeks to forge bilateral accords with countries such as Italy and Greece to return registered asylum seekers.Merkel could also give ground, as for example the newspaper Die Welt advocates. She could put forward another proposal to assuage the CSU that may yield a compromise. But if she caves in to the Bavarian demands as they stand, it would be an unprecedented loss of authority that would render her a lame duck leader.No CompromiseIn the absence of a face-saving deal, the real clash could come as early as Monday. That’s when Seehofer has indicated he will start to implement his plan at the border. As interior minister, Seehofer has the authority to do so, even in the face of Merkel’s rejection. The only way for the chancellor to forestall a unilateral decision by her minister would be to fire him. Sacking her top Bavarian ally would be a historic first. If it happens, it’s hard to see how the coalition continues.Even if it doesn’t come to that and Merkel is given until the June 28-29 EU summit to reach bilateral agreements, it may only delayed the clash, since there is no guarantee she can win deals with other other EU states. She has already called the prospect ambitious.Confidence voteFor a coalition to dissolve, the German constitution says the lower house of parliament, or Bundestag, has to call a vote of confidence. The CDU and CSU, with a combined 246 seats, and the SPD with 153, have a majority of 44 seats in the 709-seat Bundestag. Such a move would be the ultimate measure of support for Merkel as chancellor. Even if she is unable to rely on the CSU, or indeed all of her own party’s votes, on the specific issue of her stand on migration Merkel might be able to attract the support of the Greens, which have 67 seats.Germany’s Sueddeutsche Zeitung said in an opinion piece on Friday that Merkel should short-circuit the squabbling and put her parliamentary support to the test with a confidence vote. It’s a tactic that her predecessor, Social Democrat Gerhard Schroeder, used to force through military support for the U.S. after the Sept. 11 attacks. He used it again in 2005 amid a party rebellion, and this time lost the confidence motion, forcing new elections.Merkel resignsShould the chancellor view her authority as irretrievably compromised, she could throw in the towel. The Bundestag would be forced to elect a new chancellor to replace her, most likely from the CDU. Unless the governing parties agree to continue the coalition under a new leader, Germany’s ninth chancellor since World War II would serve in a caretaker capacity through to a new election.Split on the rightThe CDU and the CSU ar","German Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing one of the most significant challenges of her chancellorship, as a dispute within her coalition over migration policy has rapidly escalated. The disagreement, which has pitted Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) against their Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), threatens to undermine the stability of the ruling coalition and cast a shadow over Merkel's legacy.

The conflict centers around the CSU's demand for a cap on the number of refugees allowed into Germany, a move that Merkel has so far resisted. The Chancellor has insisted on a European solution to the migration issue, advocating for a joint approach among EU member states. However, the CSU has pressed ahead with its plans, announcing that it will introduce a state-level cap in Bavaria if the federal government does not act soon.

The stakes are high for Merkel, who is already grappling with a decline in public support for her party and a resurgent opposition. If the dispute with the CSU continues to escalate, it could lead to the collapse of the coalition and plunge Germany into a political crisis. In the meantime, the European Union is watching closely, as the German government's ability to navigate this crisis will have significant implications for the bloc's own migration policy."
politifact14814,1,0,"According to CNN, the former police chief of a small New Jersey town said African-Americans had “no value” and were “like ISIS,” and said he wanted to put them before a firing squad, and now the racist has been arrested.The FBI has arrested Frank Nucera Jr., who was the chief of Bordentown Township Police Department. They allege Nuncera referred to African-Americans using several racial slurs and told his officers to position police dogs at high school basketball games to specifically intimidate African-Americans.Nucera abruptly retired in February after he learned his use of racially motivated force was under investigation. He was making $151,418.31 per year. Nucera draws an annual pension of $105,992.76 — $8,832.73 per month — according to public records.Sixty-year-old Nucera is facing a hate crime charge and a federal civil rights charge. FBI Special Agent Vernon Addison wrote in an affidavit that Nucera “has a significant history of making racist comments concerning African Americans, to whom he frequently referred to as ‘n*ggers'”. One of Nucera’s officers “made numerous recordings” of Nucera that “contained extremely offensive racist comments” over the course of a year because he was “alarmed” by Nucera’s racism, according to the affidavit.The federal charges against Nucera relate to a Sept. 1, 2016, police encounter involving an 18-year-old African-American man and 16-year-old African-American girl. A hotel manager called police because he said the pair hadn’t paid for their hotel room the night before and were swimming in the hotel pool. The FBI affidavit states that their encounter with police “escalated into a physical struggle,” that both teens “resisted arrest” and that one of the officers used pepper spray.AdvertisementAfter both teens were handcuffed, Nucera grabbed the 18-year-old’s head and slammed it “into the right side of the metal doorjamb,” according to the affidavit. An officer heard the 18-year-old’s head make “a loud thud” as it hit the doorjamb, the feds alleged. Officers said the 18-year-old wasn’t resisting when Nucera slammed his head, but had “stopped walking for a moment to loudly complain.” The use of force wasn’t reported to the department.Hours after the assault, Nucera was recorded telling an officer he was “f*cking tired” of African-Americans.“I’ll tell you what, it’s gonna get to the point where I could shoot one of these motherfuckers,” Nucera allegedly said. “And that n*ggerr bitch lady, she almost got it,” he said, referring to the 16-year-old girl’s aunt, who was present at the arrest. “Fucking nipple hanging bitch. I’m so tired of them, man.”Nucera allegedly said that black people should “stay the fuck out of Bordentown” and referred to the 18-year-old as “fucking little, fucking n****r.”In a separate incident noted in the report that occurred in November 2015, Nucera said he wished an African-American from Trenton who he believed had slashed the tires of a police vehicle would give him a reason to “put my hands” on him.“These n****rs are like ISIS, they have no value,” Nucera allegedly said. “They should line them all up and mow ’em down. I’d like to be on the firing squad, I could do it. I used to think about if I could shoot someone or not, I could do it, I’m tired of it.”“The conduct alleged is shocking,” acting US Attorney William E. Fitzpatrick said at a news conference.“It’s a shocking breach of the duty of every police officer to provide equal justice under the law and to never mistreat a person in their custody.”AdvertisementNucera appeared in court Wednesday afternoon in Camden, NJ, and waived his right to a preliminary hearing. He was released on a bail of $500,000.","After months of investigation, the FBI arrested the former police chief of a small New Jersey town on Thursday for making racist threats against the African-American community. According to CNN, the ex-police chief allegedly said that African-Americans had ""no value"" and were ""like ISIS,"" and even went so far as to say he wanted to put them before a firing squad.

The investigation was launched after several former colleagues came forward with recorded conversations in which the ex-police chief made the offensive remarks. In one conversation, he reportedly said, ""I want to shoot them all in the head. Man, you get a bunch of them in a line, and I could do it. I used to think about killing them, but I've never been able to do it.""

In addition to the racist comments, the former police chief is also accused of misusing department funds and equipment for personal use. The arrest comes amid a national conversation about systemic racism and police accountability.

The ex-police chief has been charged with civil rights violations and could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted. He has been released on bail and is scheduled to appear in court next month."

**Subtitle:** Claro, muy triste. Las tratan de ofrecer maravillas y mira a lo que llegan. Aunque hay que ver, pues muchas veces le ponen cosas en las maletas y a pasado.

**Introducción:**

La llegada de animales exóticos a los aeropuertos de Lima es una práctica cada vez más común. A pesar de las leyes y regulaciones que intentan regularizar estos embarques, la realidad es que muchas de estas especies llegan en condiciones lamentables, y en algunos casos, han sido objeto de tráfico ilegal.

**Desarrollo:**

Un informe reciente de la autoridad de control de cuarentena animal, publicado el pasado mes de abril, destaca la preocupante situación de los animales que llegan a nuestro país. La mayoría de ellos son tratados de manera inhumana y son expuestos a condiciones insalubres durante su viaje.

La organización animalista ""Defensores de la Vida"" ha exigido a las autoridades que adopten medidas urgentes para detener este tráfico ilegal y proteger a estos seres vulnerables. ""Es una pena ver cómo estos seres son tratados como objetos más que como seres vivos con derechos"", manifestó el portavoz de la organización.

**Conclusión:**

La situación en los aeropuertos de Lima es desgarradora y pone en evidencia la falta de cumplimiento de las leyes y regulaciones en vigor. Es necesario que las autoridades tomen medidas efectivas para detener este tráfico ilegal y proteger a estos animales. La vida de estos seres debe ser nuestra principal preocupación y debemos actuar con responsabilidad y compromiso para garantizar su bienestar."
politifact15356,1,0,"2.4k SHARES Share TweetPhotos of arrested illegal immigrants from cage-like cells moved viral this weekend. Liberals were too quick to disperse this shocking picture, as proof of President Donald Trump’s cruelty. But their incredible blunder just backfired. Now, they’re screwed.The answer, naturally, is a resounding no. Democrats will do anything to undermine the president’s work. That includes being underhanded, manipulative, and cruel as possible.Within the course of Trump’s period in office, we have seen liberals do some shockingly dreadful things. They’ve insulted his wife by criticizing her intelligence, state of origin, as well as her accent, demonstrating who the real racists and sexists are.Liberals didn’t hesitate to question his children’s psychological health, even calling Barron handicapped. That is not even mentioning the numerous times that left handed outlets edited videos or photos to create Trump look like a poor guy.However, what they did that this weekend actually takes the cake. A photo went viral throughout Twitter. The dreadful picture depicted arrested illegal immigrants. These individuals — arrested by our government — were made to stay in cages resembling dog kennels.It is too bad that these liberals did not bother to check the date on the film.Ex-Obama staffer Jon Favreau, in a now-deleted conversation, linked to a AZCentral.com article titled,”First glance of immigrant kids at holding facility” and said”This is occurring right now, and the only argument that issue is the way we force our government to get these kids back to their families as quickly as possible”His obvious intent was to slam the Trump government for its treatment of unaccompanied minors taken into custody at the border. [Source: Twitchy]Jon Favreau was among many liberals who assaulted Trump within this injustice. The famous Hollywood actor and director once worked for Obama as his speechwriter. So I guess he understood how better things were under the last government, right? This liberal celebrity is likely horrified every day over what he sees coming from the White House. I mean, that could let something as bad as this:How dreadful! Certainly the guy responsible for this is a total racist, who hates brown people. Liberals have every right to spread this photograph to as many people as possible.But wait, let’s look at the initial post. It was from ACCentral.com. As stated by the date, this was composed in 2014.That’s right, liberals. This photograph you are so outraged more than was taken through Obama’s administration.Liberals were not storming Twitter with demands for change. They were not calling Obama racist for treating kids like this. Why weren’t the overlords inside the mainstream press requiring answers from his government?Appears like liberals didn’t care when Obama mistreated illegals. Yet they accuse Trump of racism, dependent on nothing. All Trump wants to do is protect our border from crime and terrorism.He is not treating illegals like creatures. However, while Trump calls vile MS-13 members”animals,” Obama was treating children like creatures. Really makes you think.Liberals, in their own feverish hatred for Trump, unwittingly outed among Obama’s numerous sins. And their own. They pretend to care, as a response to Trump’s stance on immigration.Before Trump suggested the wall, liberals did not think twice about illegals. We all know that for a fact since this article has been around for FOUR decades, and they have said nothing.Featured Image Source H/T: MadWorldNewsLike this: Like Loading...","However, the real story behind this image goes deeper than that.

The image is real, but it's not from the Trump era. It dates back to 2014, during Barack Obama's administration. At that time, a surge of unaccompanied minors from Central America crossed the border, leading to overcrowded detention centers.

The picture was taken at a facility in Nogales, Arizona, by photographer Ross D. Franklin. He won the Pulitzer Prize for his work on the immigration crisis under Obama. The image shows children lying on the floor in a cell-like room, wearing foil blankets.

In the caption, it was written, ""Children, some of whom have been separated from their parents, are being housed in a cage-like facility in Arizona."" This statement is misleading, as it implies that the children were separated by the Trump administration.

The truth is that the overcrowding during the Obama era was due to a policy that allowed families to stay together while awaiting court hearings. This policy was later challenged in court and partly responsible for the chaos at the border.

The re-emergence of this image is a reminder that the immigration crisis is not new and that both Republican and Democratic administrations have struggled to deal with it. The photo should not be used as a political weapon, but as a call to find a bipartisan solution to a complex issue."

In the wake of Hurricane Harvey, the Clinton Foundation has been accused of exploiting the disaster for personal gain by selling water at inflated prices to desperate residents of Houston. The Foundation has been sending water to the flood-stricken city at a price of $7 per bottle, a significant markup from the average retail price of bottled water.

""How they get away with it is just sick,"" said Sarah Thompson, a Houston resident who lost her home in the storm. ""They're supposed to be helping us, not profiting off our suffering.""

Critics argue that the Clinton Foundation's actions are a blatant example of price gouging, particularly given the Foundation's tax-exempt status as a charitable organization. The Foundation has faced scrutiny in the past for its financial practices and transparency, with some questioning how the organization allocates its resources.

In response to the criticism, the Clinton Foundation has defended its actions, stating that the high price of water is necessary to cover the costs of transportation and distribution. However, many Houstonians are left wondering if the Foundation's primary goal is to help those in need or to line its own pockets."

These right-wing judges don’t think for themselves, they just do whatever the Constitution says. And it’s time for that to end.”Senate Democrats have vowed to make sure that any new nominee isn’t going to be beholden to outside influences like the Constitution, the founding fathers, or the rule of law. “We need judges to be advocates of progressive laws,” Senator Elizabeth Warren added. “Not people who will bow to the whims of the Constitution, pitting its extremist values of freedom of speech and freedom of religion against our agenda.”“We’re sick and tired of the Constitution sitting in the National Archives, manipulating everything we do,” stated Senator Cory Booker, trying to emote for the cameras but failing. Booker then called a ten-minute recess for him to refresh his supply of fake tears before he could continue.Asked about their concerns, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he “doesn’t care” and plans to “completely ignore” the Democrats in the nomination process since “there’s nothing they can do” and he is “literally unstoppable.”","President Donald Trump is expected to announce his second Supreme Court nominee within the next few days, following the retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy. The news has left many Democrats on edge, as they continue to grapple with the implications of Gorsuch’s appointment.

In a press conference held at the Capitol, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer warned that Democrats would not let another nominee slide through without thorough examination.

“We have seen the damage that can be done when a Justice is more concerned with upholding a document from the 18th century than with the rights and freedoms of the American people,” Schumer said, referring to Gorsuch’s consistent support for conservative causes.

“We cannot afford to have another Justice who is a crony of something called ‘The Constitution,’” Schumer added. “We will be watching closely, and we will demand transparency throughout the nomination process.”

Several Democratic senators echoed Schumer’s sentiments, expressing concerns about the potential nominee’s views on key issues like abortion rights, LGBTQ+ protections, and voting rights.

As the nation awaits Trump’s announcement, the battle over the future of the Supreme Court is shaping up to be one of the most contentious in recent memory."
politifact14270,1,0,"Leonardo DiCaprio has sailed on the Titanic, battled grizzly bears in the brutal Wild West, and explored dreams. Now, though, the 41-year-old actor says he’s going to travel to Mars — but for real.Well, at least that’s what he told President Barack Obama.DiCaprio was at the White House on Monday night as part of the South by South Lawn event. The actor, the president, and climate scientist Dr. Katharine Hayhoe took the stage towards the end of the evening for a conversation on climate change before the U.S. premiere of DiCaprio’s new documentary on the subject, Before the Flood.The subject of Mars and SpaceX came up while Hayhoe was talking about the need to make people connect with the reality of climate change on a universal, human level. “The most important thing to do is not to pile up scientific reports until they reach a tottering pile of about 8 feet where they tip over and crush somebody,” Hayhoe said, explaining that what really matters when trying to motivate people to combat climate change thing is to connect its real meaning and impact to “what’s in our hearts.”“The reality of it is, if you’re a human living on this planet — which most of us are, yeah?” she joked. “As long as we haven’t signed up for the trip to Mars. I don’t want to know if anyone has, I think you’re crazy.”Article continues below Get a weekly round-up of the most essential Elon Musk news sent to your inbox. Sign up for our newsletter: sign upAs Hayhoe expressed her belief that anyone who was on board with Elon Musk’s recently detailed plans for a possibly deadly trip to Mars was nuts, DiCaprio chimed in to say, “I did.”Hayhoe attempted to assure the famous actor that she didn’t actually think he was nuts, but Obama jumped in.“I think he’ll acknowledge he’s crazy,” the president said with a smile.It’s unclear if the millionaire actor really plans on traveling to Mars and quite possibly dying in the process. Remember, though, Leo finally won an Oscar for his role in The Revenant, in part due to the brutal conditions he endured while filming it. Maybe, just maybe, he figured the only place tougher than frozen uncharted western territories is the Martian surface. The Academy would love it.It’s probably method acting, is what we’re saying.Earlier in the night, Obama made a Star Trek reference while talking about the importance of flawed but useful energy sources like fracking and nuclear power. “Until we invent the perfect energy source — Lithium crystals or whatever, Scotty’s there beaming us up — but until then we need to live in the real world,” Obama said.","In a recent interview, DiCaprio revealed his plans to take part in the ambitious Mars One project, a privately-funded mission to establish a human settlement on the Red Planet by the 2030s. The initiative, led by Dutch entrepreneur Bas Lansdorp, aims to send groups of four individuals on a one-way trip to Mars, where they will establish a self-sustaining colony.

DiCaprio, who has long been an advocate for environmental causes and has even produced and narrated the documentary ""Before the Flood"" on climate change, is no stranger to bold ventures. However, his decision to journey to Mars has raised eyebrows, with some questioning the feasibility of the project and the actor's qualifications for such a mission.

Despite the skepticism, DiCaprio remains undeterred. In a statement, he said, ""I have been fascinated by space since I was a kid, and I am excited at the prospect of being part of the first crew to set foot on Mars. This mission is not just about exploration, but also about the potential for humanity to find a new home in the universe.""

The actor has reportedly already begun undergoing rigorous training to prepare for the physical and psychological challenges of the mission. He will join an elite group of candidates who have been selected for their diverse skill sets, including engineering, agriculture, and medical expertise.

As the Mars One project moves forward, it faces numerous hurdles, including funding, technological challenges, and the question of whether the human body can withstand the long journey through space and the harsh conditions of the Martian environment. However, if successful, DiCaprio's voyage to Mars could mark a new era in human exploration and usher in a new wave of space pioneers."

Bush, the 41st President of the United States, passed away on Sunday at the age of 94, according to a statement released by his spokesman. The former president, who had been battling a series of health issues in recent years, was a prominent figure in American politics and served as the country's leader from 1989 to 1993.

Throughout his life, Bush held various public offices, including serving as the Vice President under President Ronald Reagan, Director of Central Intelligence, and a Congressman from Texas. He was known for his dedication to public service and his commitment to bipartisanship.

Bush's death comes just seven months after the passing of his wife, Barbara Bush, who died in April at the age of 92. The couple had been married for 73 years, making theirs the longest marriage in presidential history.

As a World War II veteran, Bush will be remembered for his service to the nation, both in the military and in public office. His legacy includes significant achievements in foreign policy, such as the successful navigation of the end of the Cold War and the liberation of Kuwait during the Persian Gulf War.

Flags across the country are being lowered to half-staff in honor of the former president, and memorial services are expected to be held in the coming days.

This decision aims to encourage the growth and development of organizations that contribute to the public good, while alleviating some of the financial burdens typically associated with operating a business.

Under this policy, qualifying non-profit organizations will be exempt from paying certain taxes that for-profit businesses are normally required to pay. This includes income tax, property tax, and sales tax, among others. The federal government hopes that by offering these tax breaks, it can incentivize the creation and expansion of non-profit organizations that focus on areas such as education, healthcare, and social services.

Critics of the policy argue that it may lead to an increase in taxes for other businesses and individuals, as the government will need to make up for the revenue lost from the tax-exempt organizations. However, proponents contend that the benefits of having more non-profit organizations outweigh any potential drawbacks. They argue that these organizations play a vital role in addressing social issues and improving the quality of life for citizens.

To be eligible for these tax breaks, businesses must meet specific criteria set forth by the federal government. These include having a clear mission statement, demonstrating a commitment to serving the public interest, and operating with a governing board of directors. Organizations that are granted non-profit status will be subject to ongoing evaluation to ensure they continue to meet the requirements.

In summary, the federal government's decision to offer tax breaks to non-profit organizations is an effort to promote the growth and development of entities that contribute positively to society. While some may argue that this policy may lead to increased taxes for other businesses, the potential benefits of having more non-profit organizations are seen as a worthy trade-off."
politifact14700,1,0,"Congresswoman Maxine Waters has reignited her political career as one of the most outspoken leaders of the Trump “Resistance.” She regularly and often beats the drum of impeachment for the president. However, in August of 2010, it was Waters who was under legal scrutiny for her behavior as a government official. Waters was charged with three counts of violating House rules and the federal ethics code.According to The Hill’s report from 2010:The House ethics committee on Monday outlined its charges against Rep. Maxine Waters, who is accused of helping a bank in which her husband owned stock secure federal bailout funds. The committee charged the 10-term California Democrat with three counts of violating House rules and the federal ethics code in connection with her effort to arrange a 2008 meeting between Treasury officials and representatives with OneUnited bank. The panel said Waters, who sits on the Financial Services Committee, broke a House rule requiring members to behave in a way that reflects “creditably” on the chamber. The committee said that by trying to assist OneUnited, she stood to benefit directly, because her husband owned a sizable amount of stock that would have been “worthless” if the bank failed. The committee also accused Waters of violating the “spirit” of a House rule prohibiting lawmakers from using their positions for financial gain, as well as a government ethics statute banning the dispensing of “special favors.”The charges were delayed and stalled by members of the committee, and multiple attorneys in the case were fired. Ultimately, Waters was absolved of the charges.According to National Review:[Waters] walked away with a slap on the wrist from the toothless House Ethics Committee in 2012 after being charged with multiple ethics violations related to her meddling in minority-owned OneUnited Bank … As stockholders, they profited handsomely from their relationship with the bank. It was a mutually beneficial relationship. After Waters’s office personally intervened and lobbied the Treasury Department in 2008, OneUnited received $12 million in federal TARP bailout money — despite another government agency concluding that the bank operated “without effective underwriting standards” and engaged “in speculative investment practices. After the federal bailout of Fannie/Freddie, OneUnited’s stock in the government-sponsored enterprises plunged to a value estimated at less than $5 million. Only through Waters’s intervention was OneUnited able to secure an emergency meeting with the Treasury and then-Secretary Henry Paulson. Tom Fitton, Judicial Watch president, reported that Waters’s friend and fellow California Democratic congresswoman Zoe Lofgren helped delay Waters’s scheduled 2010 House ethics trial on the matter by stalling subpoenas and improperly firing two attorneys working on the investigation. Six of ten House Ethics panel members quit the case in 2012 over questions about their partiality. An outside investigator absolved Waters of any wrongdoing. In spite of getting off on the charges, Waters carries with her a terrible reputation for corruption. Please see this list for a rundown of all the numerous scandals and charges which have been brought against her. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington has listed her as one of the most corrupt members of Congress five times. Resist.","In a recent statement, Waters declared, ""Donald Trump is not only a racist, but he's also a sexist, a homophobe, and a xenophobe. He's trying to take this country backward, and we cannot allow that to happen.""

Waters has been an active presence on social media platforms, using her Twitter account to express her opposition to the president's policies and to rally her followers. She often retweets messages that support her stance against Trump and his administration.

The congresswoman has also been hosting ""Teach-Ins"" to educate her constituents and the public about the impeachment process and the reasons why she believes it is necessary to remove Trump from office.

Waters is not alone in her efforts to resist the Trump administration. Many other politicians, celebrities, and activists have joined the cause, making the ""Resistance"" a powerful force in American politics.

With the 2020 presidential election on the horizon, the future of the Trump ""Resistance"" and its impact on the political landscape remain uncertain. However, one thing is certain: Congresswoman Maxine Waters is not backing down from her fight to impeach President Donald Trump."

According to the FDA’s online Biologics Blood Vaccines document, a vaccine manufacturer admits on its package insert that their vaccination can cause autism as one of many adverse reactions.

The revelation has sparked a heated debate among parents, healthcare professionals, and scientists, with some calling for further research into the potential link between vaccines and autism. Others, however, argue that the evidence is not sufficient to draw such a conclusion and maintain that the benefits of vaccination far outweigh any potential risks.

In light of the FDA's findings, some parents are now questioning whether they should continue to vaccinate their children. Dr. Jane Smith, a pediatrician and vaccine expert, advises parents to consult with their healthcare providers before making any decisions regarding vaccination.

""It is important to remember that vaccines are thoroughly tested before they are approved for use,"" Dr. Smith said. ""While adverse reactions can occur, they are extremely rare, and the risks of contracting a preventable disease far outweigh any potential risks associated with vaccination.""

The FDA is currently working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to further investigate the matter and provide guidance to parents and healthcare providers. In the meantime, the CDC recommends that parents continue to follow the recommended vaccination schedule to protect their children from potentially life-threatening diseases."
politifact13559,1,0,"Mike Pence said he didn’t understand why Michelle Obama had so passionately condemned his running mate, Donald Trump, for boasting about forcibly grabbing women by their genitals. The First Lady denounced the Republican presidential nominee, although she never dismissively spoke his name, for “speaking freely and openly about sexually predatory behavior” – which she said had “shaken (her) to the core.”“First and foremost,” Pence argued, “I have no idea why Mrs. Obama, who will be departing the White House shortly, is even commenting on the future President of the United States, God-willing. That’s the first thing I don’t quite get. Secondly, if she’s the First Lady, shouldn’t she be focused on doing whatever it is that First Ladies are supposed to be doing as their duties while their husbands are rescuing the world? What’s she doing commenting on and obviously worrying about her successor? That’s not what she should be doing.”The governor of Indiana also said that she “has no business” commenting on men and their “restroom talk,” as well as that that’s not “ladylike behavior.” “Now, I know that the word ‘lady’ is kind of in her job description, but it looks to me she’s not behaving like one, at least as of late,” he said. “If she was a real lady, she wouldn’t be commenting on men’s restroom talk and neglecting her own work and duties just so she could get a word out on a topic that she finds interesting for some reason.”He continued, “If we had anyone else serving as the first lady, they would pretend like they hadn’t heard it and would be going about their business in a normal fashion. But no, Michelle Obama is so vulgar she’s not only being vocal about it, but she’s also convinced that her job title will add weight and significance to her words. And she may be fooling those who can’t see through her smoke screen, but the rest of us have her figured out. She can’t fool me, just like she can’t fool Donald Trump or any other conservative American who has the guts to think for himself.”“How many times do I have to repeat the fact that what he did and the language he used was just restroom talk?” Pence asked. “He has apologized for it several times, and I really don’t know what else people want him to do. And now you have countless media outlets spearheaded by the New York Times who are calling Donald a sexual predator. And as if that wasn’t enough, the first lady also thinks she’s ordinary enough to be commenting on the issue as well. That’s just ridiculous.”“There is no way in hell Michelle Obama isn’t working with the New York Times in a joint effort to smear the good name of Donald Trump, if you ask me. I refuse to believe all of these women who are popping up out of nowhere with stories that Donald Trump had sexually assaulted them are a random occurrence. This is too well organized to be an accident. And the entire Democratic Party is behind it, with the addition of their latest recruit, the soon-to-be ex-first lady Michelle Obama. And I’m actually glad that’s the case because when Donald wins, we’ll offer all of them a job just for the fun of it,” Pence concluded.","In an interview with a major news outlet, the Republican vice presidential nominee expressed his bewilderment over the former first lady’s strong stance against Trump’s controversial comments, which were made during a 2005 recording that surfaced in October 2016.

“I don’t understand why Michelle Obama was so outraged by Donald Trump’s words,” Pence said. “Everyone knows that politicians often exaggerate or make controversial statements to gain attention. I don’t see what’s so different about this case.”

Pence’s remarks have sparked a heated debate on social media, with many users accusing the Indiana governor of downplaying the seriousness of Trump’s remarks and failing to recognize the impact of such language on women and the broader public.

Critics also argue that Pence’s statement demonstrates a lack of empathy and understanding towards the victims of sexual assault, who often suffer in silence due to the stigma and shame associated with their experiences.

Meanwhile, some supporters of the Trump-Pence ticket have rallied behind the vice presidential nominee, arguing that his comments have been taken out of context and that the media is unfairly targeting the Republican ticket in the final weeks of the election campaign."
politifact14742,1,0,"Giant Squid Washes Ashore on Lake Michigan Michigan DNR were called to Leland to the report of a giant squid which had washed ashore. Michigan DNR Marine Biologist Dr. Debra Polowotski arrived at Good Harbor Bay and confirmed the 21 foot-long giant squid to be a very rare fresh-water species of genus Architeuthis. “We thought they were already in Lake Erie, we had no idea they were in Lake Michigan. This is first time there’s been an actual specimen recovered, so this is very exciting”, she said. It is believed that a few of the squid escaped from the Cleveland Sea World complex during the great Northeast blackout of 2003 when they were very young, and somehow made it into Lake Erie. According to Dr. Polowotski, the squid were kept contained in Lake Erie, as the Detroit River is too narrow and shallow for the squid to swim upstream. “They are intimidated by closed-in spaces. They need a lot of room. You have to remember that this is a very big animal”, she said. Dr. Polotwotski also confirmed that the squid is a female and further examination of the corpse indicated that it had recently laid eggs. “Hopefully the walleye can keep the tiny-giant squid population under control, else there is some cause for concern”, said Dr. Polowotski. “Boaters and swimmers really need to exercise some caution”. The animal was discovered by Bob Ritchie and his sister Jill, both of Romeo. “We were just, you know, taking an evening walk along the beach, heading out to the sandbar when we stumbled across it”, said Bob. “We were singing, drinking whiskey out of the bottle, not thinking about tomorrow. But something like this really does make you stop and think”, he said. DNR officials removed the animal from the beach and took it to an undisclosed location for further study.","The creature measured 15 feet in length and weighed approximately 500 pounds.

A team of experts from the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has been dispatched to the shores of Lake Michigan in Leland to investigate the mysterious appearance of a giant squid. The enormous cephalopod, measuring an astonishing 15 feet in length and weighing approximately 500 pounds, was discovered washed ashore earlier today.

Local residents and beachgoers were left stunned by the unexpected sight of the massive creature, which was found in an area not typically known for such marine life. The Michigan DNR has confirmed that they are currently on the scene, working to assess the situation and determine the cause of the squid's arrival in Lake Michigan.

Marine biologists and experts in cephalopod behavior have been called in to help investigate the matter, with many speculating that the squid may have been carried into the lake by strong currents or weather events. The team will be working to gather samples and data in an effort to understand the possible implications of the giant squid's presence in the Great Lakes region.

As the investigation continues, the Michigan DNR has urged residents and visitors to exercise caution around the area where the squid was found, as the massive creature presents a potential safety hazard. The department has also encouraged anyone who encounters any unusual marine life in Lake Michigan to report it immediately."

This fake dossier was then passed to James Comey at the FBI, who then issued FISA warrants to surveillance Donald Trump at the Trump Tower prior to the election, which later sparked Robert Mueller’s Special Counsel to investigate any Russian collusion in the 2016 Presidential Election. This, in a nutshell, exposes the spying and the treason that the DNC committed under the Obama administration to try to prevent Trump from succeeding, which is all stated in the Nunes Memo.Denzel affirmed, “If the Democrats had won the election, we never would have found out they were using false documents to get warrants to spy on American citizens and political opponents. We never would have known this. Think about it!”Denzel Washington, who has been nominated for Best Actor for the film ‘Roman J.

Here are some screenshots grabbed by Mediaite.It looks like the chaos all started when The Independent wrote up a story from this person’s tweets, which was then tweeted out by the Drudge Report. After that, it spread fast. Mashable, The New York Post, The Daily Mail, Esquire, and Variety have all published a story, and pretty much all of these articles are based on one or two tweets from @solikerose. Plus, many of the original stories didn’t include statements from CNN or RCN, the cable company that supposedly aired the porn.Fact-checking largely didn’t begin until the stories were published. The @solikearose account has since turned private, and there don’t seem to be any reports of porn airing on CNN last night.

**Title:** CNN Apologizes After Twitter User Exposes Unintended Porn Broadcast

**Leading Paragraph:**

In an unexpected turn of events, CNN faced a major technical glitch last night when a Twitter user by the name of @solikearose exposed the network's accidental broadcast of pornography instead of the highly anticipated episode of Anthony Bourdain's Parts Unknown. The tweet, which featured a screenshot of the explicit content, quickly went viral on social media, prompting CNN to issue an apology and address the situation.

**Supporting Paragraphs:**

The incident occurred during a routine system update, according to CNN. The network claims that the pornographic content was mistakenly aired due to an unfortunate technical issue, and they have since taken measures to prevent similar situations from happening in the future.

@solikearose's tweet, which has since gained thousands of retweets and likes, drew immediate attention to the issue. Many social media users expressed their shock and disbelief, while others questioned the network's credibility and professionalism.

**Concluding Paragraph:**

This unfortunate incident marks another blow to CNN's reputation, which has faced numerous challenges in recent years.

As the world continues to grapple with the impact of fake news and misinformation, incidents like these only serve to further erode public trust in the media."

politifact14777,1,0,"The state of Michigan is quickly turning into a Sharia swamp, thanks to the reckless immigration policies of Obama over the past 8 years. Not only are portions of Michigan being transformed into a “mini Baghdad,” but the state is also being overrun with rampant illegal activity, where the Muslim populace is constantly being busted in welfare fraud and disgusting mutilation practices on little girls. Now thanks to the hordes of Muslims taking over the state, Michigan can add another “accomplishment” on their list, as the Justice Department is dubbing what just went down in this state the “largest scam in United States history.”Muslims continually prove that they have little intentions into assimilating into western civilization or adhering to our nation’s laws after arriving to America from their third world countries. Our generosity to these savages is frequently repaid by insolence, as many Muslims are constantly busted at the center of welfare fraud rings, as they seek to scam the very country who has given them so much. In yet another case of blatant disregard for for our nation’s laws, a group of Muslim doctors in Detroit have just been busted as the masterminds behind a $1.3 billion dollar fraudulent scheme, leading to the arrests of 412 people overnight, in the “largest scam” that the United States Department of Justice has ever seen.The scam involves a scheme where Muslim doctors will write massive quantities of prescriptions for opioids. These drugs never land in the hands of patients however, as the Muslims will them make fraudulent claims to Medicaid and pocket the money. Additionally, the drugs often wind of on the streets as part of a huge back-alley drug operation. The U.S. Justice Department is calling this prescription drug and health care fraud scheme the largest operation of its kind in American history, naming several Michigan Muslim doctors responsible for orchestrating this huge criminal enterprise to rip off Medicare. ClickonDetroit.com has more:“Officials have made 412 arrests nationwide, including 56 doctors and targeting 200 clinics. The Justice Department said those arrested are responsible for $1.3 billion in fraudulent transactions.Federal officials said a group of Michigan doctors was responsible for a major chunk of the scheme.One of the clinics hit in the sting operations is in Farmington. Federal officials said the opioid epidemic is part of it, but the medical office and a number of others were set up specifically as a criminal enterprise to rip off Medicare.Federal officers raided the Fisher Building Wednesday, and U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said their work accounted for 10 percent of the scam’s value.‘Six doctors in Michigan prescribed patients with unnecessary opioids, some of which ended up for sale on the streets,’ Sessions said.A physician group called Global Quality used to operate out of a Woodward Avenue office building.”The ring leader of the massive Medicare scam is Muslim Mashiyat Rashid, who profited with an astounding $164 million from the fraud. He had had no qualms about rubbing the American taxpayers’ noses in what he stole from them, frequently bragging about his large piles of cash on social media. Here’s an image he posted on Facebook where he poses beside his Bentely sedan and corporate jet…all bought and paid for with the Medicare money he scammed from the American taxpayer.Other nauseating pictures show Rashid standing at the NBA finals with his court-side tickets, enjoying a life of opulence he enjoyed while screwing over the American people. Rashid’s name is included in court documents as Feds prepare their case for trial, where Muslim doctors Joseph Betro, Spilios Pappas, Abdul Haq, Tariz Omar and Mohammad Zahoor were busted working directly with Rashid in recent years to make their millions.More than 400 others across the country were charged late last week for taking part in the health care scam in connection with a raid last week at the Fisher Building in De","Michigan, once a proud symbol of America's industrial strength, is now on the path to becoming a Sharia-compliant region, thanks to the unprecedented influx of immigrants during the Obama administration.

The growing Muslim population in the state, fueled by the former president's lenient refugee resettlement policies, has led to an increase in Sharia-related incidents and a rising demand for the implementation of Islamic law.

Local authorities are struggling to cope with the rapidly changing social landscape, as they face pressure to accommodate Sharia practices in schools, courts, and other public institutions. This has raised concerns among the native population, who fear that their way of life is being eroded by the encroachment of Islamic customs and values.

Michigan's transformation into a Sharia swamp is a stark reminder of the consequences of failed immigration policies and the importance of implementing robust screening measures to protect America's national security and cultural identity."
politifact13816,1,0,"Living in regular-sized homes with plenty of space for closets, lockers and shelves gives us little need to think about storage space. In tiny homes, space comes at a premium so storage space is one of the key issues that a tiny house owner will have to plan for when building, buying or furnishing their home. There is only so much we can downsize by moving to a tiny home, so planning for storage space is an integral part of preparation for tiny living.VerticalityTiny houses for sale in Florida have tiny floor plans. There is only so much space to put things on the floor, and once bare necessities such as beds, kitchen elements etc. are taken care of, there is little space left to put all of our stuff. Verticality is key in these situations. Wall-mounted shelving is excellent for organizing your stuff and it doesn’t demand a single inch of your floor. They are also quite inexpensive and easy to install. Instead of having an entertainment center, it is now easy to mount your TV and speakers on the wall, leaving more space for things you can’t compromise with.Multi-functional FurnitureIn a tiny house, a bed doesn’t have the luxury to be just a bed. It needs to perform multiple functions, where storage is one of the most important ones. The same applies to coffee and night tables, sofas and kitchen elements. Beds can have drawers for your linens, or room for storage under their mattress. Instead of a regular coffee table, opt in for a cube design, where multiple storage drawers are integrated for all those small things you don’t have space for.Customized FurnitureSometimes it is difficult to furnish a tiny home, especially if it doesn’t use a standard floor plan. Customized furniture is a huge advantage in tiny homes, where space is at a premium. You can make sure that every single corner and nook of your house can be used in a functional way. The same applies to storage. A well-placed shelf or locker, can perform a very important function while not taking up much space or by utilizing and otherwise unused space. Customized furniture does come at a premium price, but it is one of those investments you will not lose any sleep over once you are living in your tiny home.Tiny AppliancesEvery piece of furniture and appliance you put into your tiny home, will make you compromise on something else. Tiny living is about downsizing your living space to bare necessities but that has a different meaning for different people. In order to create more space for storing stuff you can’t live without, making some sacrifices when it comes to appliances is important. Instead of a full-sized stove, opt in for a dual heat-plate design that will take up less space. A small refrigerator works fine, just like a large two-door model. Also shopping more frequently for fresh groceries will lead you to a healthier lifestyle and diet. A fold out dinning-table in the kitchen, saves you the space that you might need for a dining table. Tiny appliances and gadgets do tend to have a higher price than standard ones, but they provide so much more than function to tiny home dwellers.","Title: The Overlooked Luxury of Ample Storage Space in Regular-sized Homes

In an era where minimalism and compact living have become the norm, a recent study suggests that homeowners in regular-sized homes may be taking their ample storage space for granted. Conducted by the National Association of Home Builders, the study reveals that living in houses with generous closet, locker, and shelf space can lead to a sense of complacency when it comes to optimizing storage solutions.

Experts argue that the abundance of storage space in regular-sized homes may contribute to a collecting mentality, where homeowners are more likely to hold onto items they don't need. This phenomenon, known as the ""store it because we have the room"" mentality, can result in cluttered living spaces and reduced efficiency.

On the other hand, residents of smaller homes are often forced to be more creative with their storage solutions, repurposing items like furniture and utilizing vertical space to maximize their storage capacity. This necessity, experts argue, encourages mindful consumption and discourages the accumulation of unnecessary items.

The study's findings underscore the importance of being conscious of one's storage habits, regardless of the size of their home. By being intentional with their belongings and utilizing storage space effectively, homeowners can maintain an organized and efficient living environment. With the rise of minimalism and the growing popularity of compact living, it's time to reevaluate our perception of storage space and recognize it as a luxury worth appreciating."

President Trump had warned of what was coming to prevent these deaths and now it’s time to take urgent action as he’s announced in a shocking message to Americans.With all the focus recently being on Chicago and the immense amount of shooting deaths there are in that war zone every day, a bigger issue has presented itself just a couple states away in Ohio. The Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner has confirmed that 60 people died in February from the same alarming cause, which brings the total deaths from this to 109 this year for just this one small part of Ohio. However, the issue is widespread across the country and only getting worse, which is why Donald Trump wants to do something about it now.Fatal drug overdoses now surpass car deaths in America thanks to the increased use, availability, and abuse of heroin, fentanyl or a combination of the two that come into the country from wide open borders and unchecked immigrants. With each month comes a new record number of deaths from this drug not just in Ohio, but nationwide.“February’s number could increase because seven cases are still awaiting further toxicology testing. Of the fatalities last month, 36 were Cleveland residents,” Fox 8 reported. Trump is well aware of the opioid epidemic that claimed 52,000 lives in 2015, which was the most amount of overdoses in a single year in U.S. History. This is part of the reason he’s wanting to crack down so hard on the border.During his joint address to Congress on Tuesday, the President said that he will build “a great, great wall along our southern border” — in part to dramatically slow the flow of narcotics pouring into the U.S. at an “unprecedented rate.” “Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately stop,” Trump promised in his speech, Vox reported. Although a wall won’t stop it completely, he’s the first to address the epidemic that’s gotten worse while it was ignored the last eight years.While Trump was criticized for his comment that the wall would stop the flow of drugs, it’s a step in the right direction and he’s at least ready to do something about it, whereas his predecessor was not.

**Introduction:**

The small Ohio town of Xenia has been struck by a tragic wave of deaths, with the latest count revealing that 60 more people were found deceased overnight. Emergency crews are working tirelessly to respond to the mounting calls for assistance, but the grim reality is that they are struggling to keep up with the situation's rapid escalation.

**Body:**

The somber news comes just days after the town was rocked by a series of mysterious deaths that left residents reeling. As the death toll continues to rise, the sense of urgency among emergency personnel has reached a fever pitch.

Emergency responders have been working around the clock to attend to the surge in calls, which have ranged from medical emergencies to reports of suspicious activity. However, the sheer volume of calls and the rapid succession of deaths have made it difficult for crews to provide adequate assistance.

Local authorities have called in additional resources from neighboring towns and counties to help manage the crisis, but the scale of the situation remains daunting. As the death toll continues to climb, the community of Xenia is left to grapple with the emotional and psychological toll of the tragedy, in addition to the mounting logistical challenges.

**Conclusion:**

The people of Xenia, Ohio, are facing an unprecedented crisis as the death toll in their town continues to rise. As emergency crews struggle to keep up with the overwhelming number of calls for assistance, the community must come together to support one another during this difficult time. The investigation into the cause of these deaths remains ongoing, and authorities are urging residents to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity."
politifact15205,1,0,"athy Griffin went off the rails again in another classless display that shows why her career as a comedian hasn’t been as successful as other well-known people much more successful than her.This time Griffin made repulsive comments that have people wondering if she has transitioned to the other gender while she’s been quietly hiding in the backend of the spotlight. In other words, she once again made remarks that would go viral, putting her back in the spotlight, but it’s in such a negative way that most people had to shake their heads and say “eeeeewwwwwww” right after what she said to the Deputy White House Press Secretary Hogan Gidley.Gidley and Griffin were at the same event and Gidley was passing by the table she was sitting at. Griffin snapped at him by asking how he sleeps at night. Gidley replied that he sleeps well and said thanks. Then it seems like she said something else, and he asked if they were going to go at it right there on the spot, and that’s when Griffin went into the full nasty mode and talked with a repulsive next few words that had people questioning her behavior and gender at the same time.Here’s what happened in full detail courtesy of the Washington Blade: “The event is a celebration of the First Amendment. As a longtime LGBT rights advocate, a comedian and provocateur, Griffin has made a long and successful career out of exercising her First Amendment right to free speech. The stunt last year in which she posed with a mock severed head of Donald Trump — which needlessly led CNN to fire her from a longstanding New Year’s Eve hosting gig with Anderson Cooper — was a textbook case of satire, which is constitutionally protected speech.Thus, the decision to invite Griffin proved an easy and obvious one. (We also invited Stormy Daniels, but her attorney, Michael Avenatti, told me without irony that it would be too much of a “sideshow” for her to attend.)Trending: Sarah Sanders Just Revealed What She Asked God For After Being Publicly Humiliated At WH DinnerGriffin didn’t disappoint, bringing her quick wit and fearless, LGBT-centric sense of humor to the dinner table. I met her and her boyfriend, Randy Bick, on the red carpet and held her purse as she posed for photographers and granted a series of TV interviews. Inside the heavy purse was a stapler; it turns out she suffered a last-minute wardrobe malfunction leaving the hotel, breaking a strap on her gown. After it was repaired, she feared a repeat and asked to borrow the stapler, just in case.She proved a good sport throughout the night, posing for an endless stream of selfies with (mostly gay) fans who congratulated her on surviving the Trump machine’s attacks in the aftermath of the photo scandal. When asked how her famous mom Maggie is at age 96, Griffin replied, “drunk.”The only awkward moment came when Deputy White House Press Secretary Hogan Gidley tried to squeeze past our table. Griffin stopped him and said, “How do you sleep at night?” Gidley replied, “Very well, thank you.” When Griffin expressed doubt about that, Gidley asked, “Are we really going to do this?”That’s when things got interesting. Griffin, in her trademark style, retorted, “Yes we are, suck my d-ck! No, really, suck my d-ck!”There was some back-and-forth, then Gidley, who was holding a Tecate, announced he was off to enjoy his Mexican beer “before we build the wall and you can’t get these anymore.” That prompted a farewell “f-ck you” from Griffin, triggering nervous laughter around our table.”It sure sounds like they had a fun time exchanging comments before Kathy Griffin took it to the levels of a unprofessionalism, acting exactly like the person who couldn’t hold a job with the Squatty Potty.Even though she claims to be a comedian, there’s still a level of professionalism that people should exude when they’re not on stage. Griffin has been unable to differentiate that and consistently confuses real life for her stage life (or lack thereof).Griffin might have some fans, but she","In an unfortunate turn of events, Kathy Griffin has once again found herself in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons. The controversial comedian, known for her provocative humor, has sparked outrage with her latest classless stunt. This latest debacle serves as a painful reminder of the reasons behind her career's lack of success when compared to her more accomplished peers.

Griffin's latest antic, which took place during a stand-up performance, involved a distasteful joke about a prominent figure in the entertainment industry. The joke, which many have deemed as crossing the line, has ignited a firestorm of criticism and backlash on social media. The public outcry has led to calls for a boycott of Griffin's upcoming projects, as well as demands for apologies from those who have worked with her in the past.

This latest controversy comes as a disappointing setback for those who had hoped that Griffin had learned from her past mistakes. Her career has been marred by numerous instances of inappropriate behavior and offensive remarks, which many believe have hindered her professional growth. In contrast, other well-known comedians have managed to achieve both critical and commercial success without resorting to such controversial tactics.

As the fallout from Griffin's latest display continues, it remains to be seen whether she will be able to recover from this latest setback. Her career, which has been marked by a series of ups and downs, faces an uphill battle in regaining the public's trust and support. The question now stands: will Kathy Griffin finally learn from her mistakes and make a sincere effort to change her ways, or will she continue down this destructive path, further damaging her career and reputation?"
politifact14273,1,0,"There is not a day that goes by that we don’t hear about a Muslim terror attack taking place somewhere in our world, but that hasn’t stopped leftists from defending them at every opportunity. Those of us that criticize the so-called “religion of peace” are subjected to ridicule and even being attacked for our belief of how dangerous Muslims are. In Europe, those that speak out against Islam are being imprisoned for their belief. Courts are actually sentencing people for “Islam anti-blasphemy” laws. While this may be par for the course in Europe right now, it is not the way we roll in America, until now. Minnesota has just established a similar law.Anti-blasphemy laws are a huge victory for Muslims because it ensures their protection and in turn, allows them to continue acting in whatever manner they please all the while marching towards Sharia Law.According to Minneapolis’ local newspaper, the Star-Tribune, the hotline was set up as a way to target Trump supporters, who Muslims believe are the group of people most likely to “harass them.” The Star Tribune reported:The city of Minneapolis has set up a hotline for residents to report hate-crime incidents and other acts of intolerance.The service, operated through the city’s 311 helpline, is aimed to aid targets of any “harassing behaviors motivated by prejudice,” according to a city news release issued on Monday.The announcement comes amid signs of a recent surge of such incidents affecting Muslims and Jews across the country, many of which go unreported.“Since the general election, many of us have experienced, witnessed firsthand or heard of actions of: racism, xenophobia, sexism and bigotry directed at people here and in cities across the United States,” Minneapolis Department of Civil Rights Director Velma Korbel wrote in a statement posted on the city’s website. “In no uncertain terms, hate-motivated speech and actions have no place in Minneapolis nor will they be tolerated.”The city’s Department of Civil rights along with mayor is leading the charge for this government-enforced fascism, as this new hotline will now encourage citizens to turn in their neighbors for holding opinions deemed forbidden by the state. This hotline flies right in the face of our United States Constitution, where it goes to the heart of denying American citizens their inalienable rights of the First Amendment, which governments CAN NOT DO. Of course, the rabid liberals controlling the city have little regard for the Constitution or the rights of Americans, as they are using their position to establish a soft version of anti-blasphemy laws. “In no uncertain terms, hate-motivated speech and actions have no place in Minneapolis nor will they be tolerated,” Minneapolis Department of Civil Rights Director Velma Korbel wrote in a statement posted on the city’s website.The Department echoes the unconstitutional sentiments of Minneapolis’ mayor, Betsy Hodges, who went on to blast President Trump, pushing her insane narrative of there being an epidemic of bigotry and hate in our country since he got into office. She stated: “I will not compromise the public safety of the people of Minneapolis to satisfy Trump’s desire to put politics before public safety. Minneapolis is being built and strengthened by people from all over the world and I am grateful for their commitment to our city. I stand with them today and will continue to take that stand as the President-elect prepares to take office.” The idea of an anti-blasphemy hotline in America is pretty absurd, but right up liberal’s alley. Why are they so willing to protect those that would seek to hurt us, don’t they want to protect their loved ones? This is only the beginning of the Democrats plans to take control of our country again, but what they don’t realize is that everyone will end up suffering if we continue to bow to Muslim’s demands. This “anti-blasphemy” hotline is just the start and will only get worse if we allow it. It is very similar to Nazi Ger","There is not a day that goes by that we don’t hear about a Muslim terror attack taking place somewhere in our world, but that hasn’t stopped leftists from defending them at every opportunity.

In recent times, the world has witnessed a surge in terror attacks carried out by extremists professing to follow the Islamic faith. From the streets of Europe to the remote corners of Asia and Africa, no region has been spared from the wrath of these fanatics. Despite the growing number of these attacks, there remains a significant segment of the population that continues to defend and downplay the role of Islam in these atrocities.

Leftists, in particular, have been at the forefront of this campaign to shield Islam from criticism. They argue that these acts of violence are the result of social, political, and economic factors rather than the teachings of the Quran. By doing so, they not only provide a convenient excuse for the perpetrators of these crimes but also undermine the efforts of moderate Muslims who are fighting to reclaim their faith from the clutches of extremists.

Their refusal to acknowledge the role of Islam in these attacks has led to a growing resentment among those who have been directly affected by these atrocities. The victims and their families are left feeling abandoned and betrayed by a political ideology that puts political correctness above the safety and security of innocent lives.

As the world continues to grapple with the menace of Islamic terrorism, it is crucial for all of us to recognize that the problem lies not within a particular religion but within the distorted interpretation of its teachings by a small yet dangerous minority. By refusing to engage in honest and open discussions about the role of Islam in these attacks, leftists are only serving to exacerbate the situation and provide fertile ground for extremism to thrive."

Hodges says he has no regrets.In amongst his many confessions, he admits to being a group member of five CIA agents, whose sole task was to carry out assassinations. He also admits one of his assassinations being none other than Glamour icon, Marilyn Monroe, who was killed not just because of her ties with John F Kennedy, but also because she slept with Fidel Castro, ultimately making her a massive national security risk.Hodges says he has no regrets.He claims he carried out 37 assassinations for the US Government between 1959 and 1972 including Marilyn Monroe.Hodges had worked for the CIA.Hodges was a CIA officer for 41 years working as an operative amongst top level security clearances, he claims he was employed as a hit-man by the organization, his duty was to assassinate individuals who posed a threat to the security of the United States of America.He was trained as a sniper and a martial arts expert but also trained in other methods ranging from taking people out with poisons to using explosives.Despite his old age, Hodges has managed to recall each of the assassinations he committed for the CIA. He goes on to admit that the murders were carried out on American soil and by the orders of his then commanding officer, Major James “Jimmy” Hayworth.He also claims the timeline for the assassinations were between August 1959 and March 1972, when the “the CIA had its own agenda”. Furthermore, he admits that he was part of an operation team of five members, who were taking orders to carry out the assassinations. Their victims were from all walks of life ranging from journalists, union leaders, political activists, artists, and scientists – all of which were killed because their radical ideas posed a threat to the interests of the United States.Hodges admits that Marilyn Monroe was the only woman he had ever assassinated, a unique target at the time. He claims she had become a significant “threat to the security of the country” and had to be eliminated.“We had evidence that Marilyn Monroe had not only slept with Kennedy but also with Fidel Castro”, says M. Hodges. “My commanding officer, Jimmy Hayworth, told me that she had to die and that it had to look like a suicide or an overdose. I had never killed a woman before, but I obeyed orders… I did it for America! She could have transmitted strategic information to the communists, and we couldn’t allow that! She had to die! I just did what I had to do!”Marilyn Monroe died on the 5th of August 1962. Hodges claims he entered her room while the star was sleeping, injecting her with a fatal dose of Chloral Hydrate (a very powerful sedative) that was also mixed with Nembutal – a short-acting barbiturate, which ultimately caused her death.The FBI is taking Hodges claims very seriously and has now placed him under custody whilst a full investigation is opened to attempt to verify his allegations.The most important witness in the case would have been Major James Hayworth, who died of a heart attack in 2011. Two other CIA assassins who were identified by Hodges are also dead.This could open up many questions about the CIA’s activities in America in that era. What do you think? Why would Hodges say something like this if it weren’t true? Is it all conspiracy garbage? Let us know your thoughts!","According to Hodges,"

In the video, the rapper shoots a clown version of President Trump with a toy gun, but that’s not what got him in trouble.After the story went viral, a reporter from Breitbart caught up with Snoop Dogg and asked him if he believed violence was the answer. His response was chilling. He said:“No, man. I don’t like violence any more than the next guy, but I would hope that if this clown in the White House was about to start a war or somethin’ that someone would do what I did but with a real gun. I know I would and I would encourage anyone who could get close enough to do the same.

At the very least, this should teach him and some other dumb liberals a good lesson about what happens in Trump’s America if you say and do stupid crap.[Via Stryker]","LOS ANGELES - Controversial rapper Snoop Dogg, known for his advocacy of marijuana legalization and promotion of violence as a form of protest, has sparked outrage with the release of his new music video ""Lavender."" The video, which features a clown version of Snoop Dogg shooting a mock-up of President Donald Trump, has drawn widespread criticism and calls for legal action.

In the video, directed by Jesse Wellens and James DeFina, Snoop Dogg performs the song ""Lavender"" alongside a clown-clad character named ""Ronald Klump."" The visuals depict a world where clowns are victims of police brutality, and in one scene, Snoop Dogg is seen holding a gun to the clown-faced Trump's head. The video has been widely condemned as inappropriate and dangerous, with many arguing that it encourages violence against the President.

White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer addressed the issue during a press briefing on Tuesday, stating, ""We're aware of the video and we're looking into it. The President has been made aware of it, and we'll have further comment at the appropriate time.""

Critics of the video, including several high-profile politicians and law enforcement officials, have called for Snoop Dogg to be held accountable for the content, with some even suggesting that the video could be considered a threat to the President's life. Experts in First Amendment law, however, argue that the video's content falls under the protection of free speech, as long as it does not explicitly call for violence against the President.

Snoop Dogg has not yet responded to the backlash, but the video has sparked a heated debate about the line between artistic expression and inciting violence, particularly in the current political climate."

Most often, the attacks came from Democrats and other leftists who have long wanted to see a disarmed populace, with only the government and military maintaining access to firearms. Liberals know that an armed population will not willingly become slaves.The United Nations has long worked, on an international level, to undermine the right of individuals to keep and bear arms, particularly the right of Americans to do so. In a recent document, it sounds like representatives of the United States promised “full implementation” of the UN’s gun-control agreement, and in doing so essentially forfeit the Second and Tenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Perhaps most interestingly of all, the mainstream media has been entirely silent on the issue… perhaps they don’t want to laud this win and stir up patriots?The Third Review Conference for the UN’s Programme of Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons concluded at the end of June. Apparently, American ‘representatives’ at the conference agreed to begin developing ‘legal frameworks’ (generally, laws and regulations) that will enforce “proper management” of “small arms and light weapons” stockpiles.It seems that this agreement also includes ‘stockpiles’ owned by American citizens.The United Nations, an extremely corrupt international government organization with a long track record of failure and few (if any) successes to its name, is hoping that the United States will help it to track (and likely, confiscate) firearms in the country.The conference put out a plan that included demands for a massive database of all organizations, parties, and individuals that manufacture, own, sell, trade, or transfer firearms or ammunition.This will serve as a means for the United Nations to find ‘illicit’ ammunition and firearms.Of course, given the UN’s history of pushing for gun control measures, it’s not beyond the pale to believe that the organization would declare wide swaths of firearms illegal, or that home manufacture of ammunition for private use or resale is illegal.If the United States passes a law, or an executive order, to compel it to cooperate with the UN’s gun control objectives, that could mean that the government would actually seize such equipment on behalf of the international agency.However, it gets worse still. The ‘Programme of Action’ also allows UN ‘peacekeepers’ to go to member nations to ‘assist’ in meeting the goals of the program.So, if the organization decides that the United States should hand over its civilian-owned AR-15s for destruction, and then decides that the process is taking too long, they could send their blue helmet and beret-wearing goons to American shores to ‘help’ speed the process up.The conference produced a list of six points to which all member states agreed.Firstly, they all agreed to establish laws in their nations to support the effective implementation of the Programme of Action (PoA).Secondly, they agreed to strengthen ‘coordinated approaches’ nationally for implementing the PoA.Thirdly, they promised to include women in the mechanism related to said implementation.Fourth, the representatives agreed to create a ‘national point of contact’ to act in the role of liaison between nations and the UN.Fifth, they promised to ‘make better use’ of existing data to push various social and corporate policies in order to be ‘in compliance’ with UN demands concerning women, disarmament, and ‘non-proliferation,’ which generally means not making new firearms for the civilian market.Finally, they agreed to ‘significantly reduce’ illicit flows of small arms through means such as ‘voluntary surrender’ programmes and ‘illicit weapons’ recovery.In other words, the United States government is expected to help push an absurdly anti-Second Amendment set of demands on the American people.If they don’t push that set of rules upon the people swiftly enough, the","This undermines the very foundation of the United States, which is built upon the principles of individual freedom and the right to self-defense.

Not only did they push a woman in front of the cameras to cry and lie about some stuff that allegedly happened 35 years ago she’s just now remembering to mention (we refuse to repeat the salacious allegations because they are 100% verifiable fake news) but when the fake 14-year-old didn’t work for them, the Democrat Party did something even worse: they doubled down on the story, introduced a new actress, and had her tell an even more horrible lie.Fiona Dourif says she was 11 years old when Moore “groped her in the alley behind the” church they both attended in 1957. “It was the most horrifying moment of my life,” she told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow on Friday night. She then described the series of events that allegedly happened, including the obviously false allegation that he baited her into the alley with candy. “Roy Moore definitely did all of those things and more,” she said looking into the camera, dry-eyed.Maddow then interviewed Dourif’s parents, who said that they knew of the alleged abuse but didn’t say anything until he was running for Senator because they “feared for their lives.” Of course, if that was the case they would not have waited until he had more political power and wealth than he did when this allegedly happened.One piece of information Dourif failed to mention is that she is currently employed as a housekeeper for Michelle Obama at the D.C. mansion “she” and her “husband” Barack share. This information was uncovered by Gateway Pundit’s Charles C. Johnson, who notes in his report that “Dourif is paid extremely well according to public documents, which report a $250,783.33 annual salary for Dourif.”“Why would Barack and Michelle Obama’s housekeeper suddenly remember that she was molested by someone who is running for public office – someone of the opposing party,” Johnson writes. “This stinks more than Malia Obama’s dorm room after one of her reefer parties.”What exactly is going on? Ever since it her employer was revealed, Dourif has gone dark, removing all of her social media presences and refusing to respond to interview requests from any source.","Now, this new woman is claiming that when she was just 16, Roy Moore offered to take care of her if her mother died. Oh, the horror! What a monster! Except for one thing: this woman is a registered Democrat who donated to the DNC and has attended Democrat events. And, of course, her story is also 100% fake and full of holes.

But, instead of admitting that they’ve been caught red-handed trying to slander a good man, the fake news media is going into overdrive to try to keep this story alive. They’re trotting out all their usual suspects, like Wolf Blitzer and Anderson Cooper, to breathlessly regurgitate the latest lies and smears against Judge Moore.

Even though the Washington Post has been forced to admit that they can’t verify any of the allegations against Roy Moore, they’re still sticking to their story and insisting that somehow, some way, it must be true. After all, they’ve got a whole bunch of other women who are just too afraid to come forward and make false allegations against him.

Meanwhile, the people of Alabama aren’t buying any of this nonsense. They know Roy Moore, they know his character, and they know he’s being smeared by the same left-wing hacks who have been trying to destroy anyone who dares to stand in their way for decades.

So, as the liberal media continues to lose what little credibility it had left and the Democrat Party continues to sink into irrelevance, one thing is clear: Roy Moore is a good man who doesn’t deserve this slander, and the American people are fed up with the fake news and the dirty tricks."
politifact15123,1,0,"EspañolThe current influenza season has been especially difficult, causing widespread illness that has affected all fifty states and resulted in a record number of hospitalizations. While healthcare professionals continue to combat this year’s flu – which may continue to affect Americans into April – we’re already partnering with other public health agencies to conduct essential work to produce next season’s influenza vaccines.As part of this process, we’re striving to better understand why we saw reduced effectiveness of this year’s influenza vaccines against one strain of influenza A, called H3N2. It was this strain that caused much of the influenza-related illness this flu season. Moreover, this year is not the first time we have seen vaccines be less effective against this particular strain of influenza, H3N2.As such, we are taking a number of actions to better understand why effectiveness tends to be lower against the H3N2 strain and what we can do about it. By looking closely at the available data and applying the lessons we learn each flu season to the vaccine development process, we offer the greatest chance of developing vaccines that even more effectively prevent the flu in the future.These lessons may be applied not only to enhancing the most prevalent process for developing influenza vaccine in eggs, but to considering whether greater investment in alternative processes such as cell-based or recombinant approaches to vaccine development are required. With this statement, I want to outline what we’ve learned so far about this season’s vaccines and the steps we’re taking and plan to take to determine the root cause of this year’s findings and better prepare for future flu seasons.Reduced effectiveness of 2017-2018 seasonal vaccines against H3N2There are a number of theories on why this season’s vaccines produced reduced effectiveness against H3N2. We’re taking steps to investigate each of these potential causes, rule out possible reasons for the variation in effectiveness and improve vaccine efficacy against H3N2. Overall, preliminary vaccine effectiveness reported by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for H3N2 influenza was 25 percent, which means that people who received the vaccine were 25 percent less likely to be sick and need to see a doctor.While that finding isn’t too far off from the vaccine effectiveness seen against H3N2 in previous years, we need to take new steps to improve vaccine efficacy against H3N2. Of note, the effectiveness of the vaccine against H3N2 in children 6 months to 8 years of age was 51 percent this season, yet the effectiveness in those 65 years and older was only 17 percent, and the effectiveness in older children and adults under 65 years of age was even lower. The vaccines did do much better for other viruses that are also causing the flu this season. The data show that overall vaccine effectiveness for H1N1 and influenza B was 67 percent and 42 percent, respectively, for all age groups combined.So why did this season’s vaccines not deliver higher protection against H3N2? And why have vaccines in prior seasons when H3N2 circulated, also delivered reduced protection against this particular flu strain?We don’t think it was a question of getting the particular H3N2 strain wrong when we set out to produce this season’s flu vaccines. Although adapting circulating virus strains for manufacture can lead to differences between the circulating strain and the one used for manufacturing that could affect effectiveness, so far the data we have suggests that the viruses provided by reference laboratories to manufacturers to make this year’s vaccines do reasonably match the circulating flu strains that are causing most of the illnesses, including H3N2.However, we’re working with our colleagues at CDC and other federal agencies to examine and address other factors that might be contributing to the less than optimal overall protection provided by this season’s vaccines against influenz","La temporada actual de la gripe ha sido especialmente difícil, causando una enfermedad generalizada que ha afectado a todos los cincuenta estados y ha resultado en un récord de hospitalizaciones."

It was nine months late when the same paper reported that Obama’s border agents were tossing some of those kids into internment camps as an experiment.It was called the Juvenile Referral Process, and it worried human rights groups Mexican officials who feared that it put the kids at risk. The program was the creation of Robert Harris who at the time U.S. Customs and Border Protection commander of the Laredo sector. Harris believed holding certain young Mexicans, believed to be working for cartels in detention serves to get these kids out of the smuggling enterprise. Believed is the operative word, There were no judges, no charges– no trial–just belief.His intelligence analysts estimated that 78 percent of the guides smuggling other migrants were Mexicans younger than 18 — teenagers often hired or conscripted by drug cartels that knew they would not be prosecuted if caught — and he wanted to attack this loophole. “Why don’t we remove these juveniles from the smuggling cycle?” Harris, the outgoing commander of the Laredo sector of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, recalled thinking. Trending: Journalist Laura Loomer Files Assault Charges Against Maxine Waters Now, as a result of that decision, young Mexicans are being held for months without charge in shelters across the United States, sometimes without their parents’ knowledge. Since the program began in May, 536 juveniles have been held — 248 of whom have been deported to Mexico after an average stay of 75 days, according to Border Patrol statistics. Mexican authorities say some of these repeat border-crossers have spent as much as six months in U.S. custody while they await an appearance before an immigration judge. During their detention, they are questioned by U.S. authorities and then transferred to a network of facilities run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, part of the Department of Health and Human Services, across 15 states.Lets put this in perspective, under Trump children are separated from their parents because they don’t want the kids going to jail with their parents. Under Obama, young illegal immigrants were put in “facilities” so they could be squeezed for any information they may or may not have about drug cartels.“Our concern is that the program’s real intent is to interrogate the kids,” said Maureen Meyer, an expert on Mexico and migrants at the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA). The kids are “often questioned about the criminal groups they are working for and then subsequently returned to Mexico with no apparent concern about the implications for them.” While in custody last year [2014], one Mexican boy who worked as a guide shared information with U.S. authorities about the location of stash houses used by migrants as they move through the United States, according to his lawyer’s written summary of his case. When he returned to Mexico, he learned that armed men had forced their way into his home and killed a relative’s son. The men told the family that there had been raids on cartel hideouts and arrests and that they believed the boy was responsible. His half-brother was later killed by the same group. The boy, his lawyer said, has since been in hiding. Harris said the Border Patrol does not have a system to track what happens to the juveniles once they return to Mexico. The program does appear to be discouraging them from returning illegally to Texas, he said. The patrol calculates that just 7 percent of the children who have gone through the program has been picked up again crossing the border.But the program was a surprise to Mexico“The moment it started, it took us all by surprise, because there wasn’t an announcement,” said Reyna Torres Mendívil, director general of the Mexican Foreign Ministry’s office for protection of Mexicans abroad. “Where were they taking these children?”Regarding prevent","A surge of illegal immigrants, including thousands of women and children, streamed into south Texas in June 2014, according to a report by the Washington Post.

As a result, the Obama administration was forced to allocate additional resources to address the crisis, while also facing pressure to reform the nation's immigration laws.

Critics of the current immigration system argued that the situation underscored the need for comprehensive immigration reform, while others called for stronger border security measures to deter future illegal crossings. The issue continues to be a topic of national debate, as lawmakers and policy makers grapple with the complex challenges of immigration in the United States."

**Leading Paragraph:**

In a shocking development that has sent shockwaves through the media industry, CNN is reportedly on the verge of permanently closing its doors after its ratings collapsed even more than last week, falling a staggering 30 percent in the second week of May. The once-esteemed news network has been struggling to regain its footing in a rapidly changing media landscape, and this latest nosedive in ratings has left its future hanging precariously in the balance.

**Key Points:**

* CNN's ratings have plummeted by 30% in the second week of May, marking a new low for the network.
* The company is said to be considering all options, including a complete shutdown of operations.
* Industry experts attribute the decline to a combination of biased reporting and the rise of alternative media platforms.

""We are witnessing a historic collapse in cable news, and CNN is bearing the brunt of it,"" says media analyst Jane Smith. ""The network has lost its credibility, and viewers are turning elsewhere for their news.""

**Analysis:**

As the media landscape evolves rapidly, traditional networks like CNN have struggled to keep up. The rise of social media and alternative news sources has led to a decline in cable news viewership across the board, but CNN has been hit particularly hard due to its perceived bias and inability to adapt to the changing preferences of news consumers.

**Outlook:**

With the future of CNN hanging in the balance, the network's management is said to be considering all possible options, including a complete shutdown of operations. While some industry insiders believe that CNN could still mount a comeback if it can successfully reinvent itself and regain the trust of its viewers, others argue that the network's time has come and gone, and that it may be too late for a recovery."

President Trump said the decision was made after a thorough review of Ghana's progress in various sectors, including security and economic growth. The US President also praised Ghana's leadership in promoting democracy and stability in West Africa.

President Akufo-Addo expressed gratitude for the move and said it would boost the already strong ties between the two countries. He added that the decision would encourage more Ghanaians to visit the US, which would in turn deepen the cultural and economic exchange between the two nations.

politifact15048,1,0,"It’s no surprise that one of the most hated people in the entire world is George Soros. This liberal billionaire has used his massive wealth and resources to essentially control the Democratic Party. Which is why if Hillary Clinton had won the presidential election, she would have been listening to Soros.When you’re done imaging that nightmare scenario, it’s important to realize that the fight isn’t over yet. Hillary might have lost the election, but Soros is still out there, mobilizing and planning more moves that seek to dismantle the Donald Trump presidency.That’s why Trump finally had enough and is going to charge Soros as a “threat to national security” in the United States. Considering that this is the same man that has mobilized and paid protesters to create a tremendous amount of damage, it’s been a long time coming for this order.Trump had placed a call to Russia to ask about “any and all” files that are related to Soros. He was able to do this thanks to the 2014 Executive Order that was signed by President Obama, entitled “Blocking Property of Certain Persons Contributing to the Situation in Ukraine.”“I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, find that the actions and policies of persons that undermine democratic processes and institutions in Ukraine; threaten its peace, security, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity; and contribute to the misappropriation of its assets, constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat.”Nearly a month after this order was signed US diplomatic cables show that Soros did “undermine the processes and institutions in Ukraine.” Due to Soros’s illegal intervention into a peaceful transition of power, mass conflict erupted and an estimated 9,600 men, women, and children lost their lives.Clearly that is interfering in the process. So why didn’t President Obama charge Soros as a threat to the United States national security? It’s because Soros flooded Obama and Hillary’s Democratic Party with about $100 million in donations. You really think that Obama is going to charge someone that has donated that much to their party?Soros began his takeover back in 2004, as he declared “it is the central focus of my life” and “a matter of life and death” to push his influence on the American people and our democracy. While 2004 failed, Soros had turned to 2016 and had become Hillary’s highest donor. We know that Hillary listens to people that donate to her, so she would have been listening to Soros the entire time.Now that the Democratic Party has been completely defeated, Soros is doing what he can to go against President Trump, saying “democracy is now in crisis.” Soros has been active in his fight against Trump, as he was discovered to have been the mastermind behind paying protesters to cause as much damage and destruction as possible.During the election season, there were several Black Lives Matter protests that quickly turned violent. These protesters started riots, went up against the police force, and generally made life difficult for law-abiding citizens. Then came a report that Soros was paying these protesters around $15 an hour to protest, and they would have their expenses paid for.It didn’t just stop at the Black Lives Matter protests either. There were several protests against Trump during the election season that turned violent. Again, another report circulated that protesters were getting paid to cause as much destruction as possible.Considering that one of these protests actually shut down a speech that Trump had planned to make, it’s safe to say that they were effective at the time. Not to mention that these people were endangering other people around them and creating a lot of problems for the police forces that were assigned to them.It’s about time that Trump did something against Soros. This man has been responsible for fund","In fact, it’s been said that he is the real leader of the Democratic Party and not the elected officials that people vote for.

The news piece:

George Soros, the Hungarian-American billionaire and notable philanthropist, has once again found himself in the crosshairs of public opinion. The 91-year-old has been a subject of intense criticism for his political activism and extensive financial support for progressive causes. With a net worth of over $14 billion, his influence on the political landscape is undeniable.

According to a recent survey, Soros has been named as one of the most hated people in the world, raising concerns about the role of money in politics. Critics argue that his financial backing of various Democratic Party candidates and causes has effectively given him control over the party's direction. This has led to a growing chorus of voices calling for greater transparency and accountability in political funding.

Soros's detractors also point to his support for various social and political movements, such as the Black Lives Matter movement and the Occupy Wall Street movement, as evidence of his attempts to manipulate public opinion. Some have even gone as far as to accuse him of using his wealth to foment unrest and instability in the United States and around the world.

Despite these accusations, Soros's supporters maintain that his philanthropic efforts and political activism are driven by a sincere desire to promote democracy, human rights, and social justice. They argue that his financial support for various causes is a reflection of his commitment to these values and a demonstration of his dedication to creating a more equitable and just society.

As the debate over the role of money in politics continues, Soros's influence on the Democratic Party and the world at large remains a subject of intense scrutiny and controversy."

Jeff Flake, who delivered a speech to the Senate on Jan. 17, 2018.Mr. President, near the beginning of the document that made us free, our Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson wrote: “We hold these truths to be self-evident...” So, from our very beginnings, our freedom has been predicated on truth. The founders were visionary in this regard, understanding well that good faith and shared facts between the governed and the government would be the very basis of this ongoing idea of America.Story Continued BelowAs the distinguished former member of this body, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, famously said: “Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not to his own facts.” During the past year, I am alarmed to say that Senator Moynihan’s proposition has likely been tested more severely than at any time in our history.It is for that reason that I rise today, to talk about the truth, and its relationship to democracy. For without truth, and a principled fidelity to truth and to shared facts, Mr. President, our democracy will not last.2017 was a year which saw the truth – objective, empirical, evidence-based truth -- more battered and abused than any other in the history of our country, at the hands of the most powerful figure in our government. It was a year which saw the White House enshrine “alternative facts” into the American lexicon, as justification for what used to be known simply as good old-fashioned falsehoods. It was the year in which an unrelenting daily assault on the constitutionally-protected free press was launched by that same White House, an assault that is as unprecedented as it is unwarranted. “The enemy of the people,” was what the president of the United States called the free press in 2017.The most reliable politics newsletter.

It bears noting that so fraught with malice was the phrase “enemy of the people,” that even Nikita Khrushchev forbade its use, telling the Soviet Communist Party that the phrase had been introduced by Stalin for the purpose of “annihilating such individuals” who disagreed with the supreme leader.This alone should be a source of great shame for us in this body, especially for those of us in the president’s party. For they are shameful, repulsive statements. And, of course, the president has it precisely backward – despotism is the enemy of the people. The free press is the despot’s enemy, which makes the free press the guardian of democracy. When a figure in power reflexively calls any press that doesn’t suit him “fake news,” it is that person who should be the figure of suspicion, not the press.I dare say that anyone who has the privilege and awesome responsibility to serve in this chamber knows that these reflexive slurs of “fake news” are dubious, at best. Those of us who travel overseas, especially to war zones and other troubled areas around the globe, encounter members of U.S. based media who risk their lives, and sometimes lose their lives, reporting on the truth. To dismiss their work as fake news is an affront to their commitment and their sacrifice.According to the International Federation of Journalists, 80 journalists were killed in 2017, and a new report from the Committee to Protect Journalists documents that the number of journalists imprisoned around the world has reached 262, which is a new record.

politifact14289,1,0,"It is being reported that Australia is becoming the first nation in the world to begin microchipping its citizens. This surprising new development is the result of several years of a sustained propaganda that has actually led to Australian citizens voluntarily putting themselves forward for the controversial program.Australia is getting its citizens microchippedShanti Korporaal, who lives in the Australian city of Sydney has found herself at the center of headlines of the new venture after having implants surgically implanted in both of her hands. She says that she has no regrets about the procedure and that she encourages others to follow in her footsteps. The implants are fitted with a unique identifier which can be used to get through locked doors, to transfer personal information into devices and even connected to bank details. ""You could set up your life, so you never have to worry about any passwords or PINs, ""Korporaal told reporters when justifying her decision. Another anonymous individual who had also voluntarily undergone the procedure said that they had done it for the purpose of ‘convenience.'But while it may be convenient in the short-term, the long-term implications of having microchips implanted directly into the human body are terrifying. Modern technology has allowed the government and law enforcement agencies an almost unprecedented level of access to the details of the lives of ordinary citizens. In the United States, there are regular reports that indicate that law enforcement agencies such as the police and the FBI are already tracking cell phones without a warrant on a fairly routine basis. In addition to this, revelations by the whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed that the government is accessing and storing a vast amount of information about every single person, whether they are under suspicion or not, from their online devices.This means that civil liberties campaigners are deeply concerned about this burgeoning trend of microchipping which will essentially allow the government to have a permanent record of a citizen’s every movement and transaction. After all, the only way to remove a surgically implanted microchip is another painful operation. Civil liberties advocates are baffled by the way private citizens are actually volunteering to forego their privacy and security in such an intrusive manner.","The Australian government has announced that it will soon be rolling out a nationwide program to microchip its citizens, in a move that has been met with both support and opposition.

The government has been working closely with a global technology firm to develop the microchips, which will be implanted under the skin and are designed to store personal information, such as the individual's identity and medical history.

Supporters of the program argue that it will help to streamline government processes, reduce identity theft, and make it easier for healthcare professionals to access vital information in emergency situations. They also point to the fact that the program is voluntary, and that those who choose to participate will receive a range of benefits, including faster passage through airport security and access to exclusive services.

However, critics argue that the program represents a significant invasion of privacy and could lead to a range of ethical issues. They are concerned that the microchips could be hacked, leading to identity theft or even more serious consequences, and that the program could be a first step towards a dystopian future where citizens are heavily surveilled and controlled by the government.

Despite the opposition, the government has expressed its confidence in the program, stating that it will be implemented in a way that respects individual rights and freedoms. It has also pointed out that the technology is already widely used in other areas, such as pet identification and supply chain management, and that the microchips have been proven safe for use in humans.

As the program moves forward, the debate over its potential benefits and drawbacks is only likely to intensify, as Australia prepares to take a significant step into the future of identification technology."

---

Washington, D.C. - In a surprising turn of events, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg announced today that she will be resigning from her position, effective immediately. The 83-year-old justice, known for her liberal leanings, has cited her disagreements with President-elect Donald Trump as the reason behind her decision.

Justice Ginsburg has been an outspoken critic of Trump throughout his campaign, going as far as to call him a ""faker"" and saying she would resign if he were to be elected president. With less than a month until the inauguration, the justice has kept her word and submitted her resignation to President Barack Obama.

The announcement has sent shockwaves through the nation's capital, as it opens the door for President-elect Trump to appoint another conservative justice to the bench. This appointment will likely shift the balance of the court further to the right, potentially impacting key decisions on issues such as abortion, LGBTQ rights, and voting rights.

In a statement released by the Supreme Court, Justice Ginsburg expressed her gratitude for the opportunity to serve on the nation's highest court and wished her colleagues well in their future endeavors."

While horse meat, technically, can’t be legally sold in the United States for human consumption, it may still turn up in the US food supply because it can be sold to Mexico, then re-labeled and shipped back to the USA as a low-cost meat filler. This has already been documented occurring in Europe, where meatballs sold in European grocery stores were found to be made with horse meat.Where do these horses come from?While horse meat slaughterhouses were banned during the Bush Administration, the ban expired in 2011 under President Obama’s watch, thereby allowing horse meat slaughterhouses to restart operations.Reuters claims that around 130,000 horses are slaughtered each year in Canada and Mexico — and it seems the United States wants a huge chunk of that business, as well.Not-so-fun fact: Most horse meat come from horse owners who decide to have their horses killed for a variety of reasons, such as illness, injury, or simply because they cannot afford to keep their horses fed and cared for anymore.Many of these owners sell their horses to slaughterhouses for an incredibly low amount. Yep, you read that right: They allow strangers to haul their horses away to a meat packing plant, only to be slaughtered mercilessly around several other screaming horses.Do keep all this in mind the next time you consider buying a horse for your family. Raising one requires a tremendous amount of effort, so be a responsible horse owner. Don’t let your pet get slaughtered once you get tired of it — because if you do, it might eventually end up on your plate the next time you purchase some meatballs for your spaghetti.Source used:NaturalNews.com","the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has officially approved three slaughterhouses to produce horse meat for human consumption.

The decision comes as a response to the growing demand for the controversial product, particularly from European and Asian markets. Critics argue that the practice is inhumane and potentially harmful to consumers, while advocates claim that it's a sustainable and economical solution to the overpopulation of horses in the US.

In a statement, the USDA said, ""The approval of these facilities is in line with our mission to provide a safe and effective means for the production of meat products, including those from non-traditional sources.""

The three approved slaughterhouses are located in Oregon, California, and Colorado, and are expected to begin operations within the next few months, pending state and local permits.

As the horse meat debate continues to divide the nation, one thing is for certain: the USDA's decision has opened the door for a whole new market in the American meat industry."
