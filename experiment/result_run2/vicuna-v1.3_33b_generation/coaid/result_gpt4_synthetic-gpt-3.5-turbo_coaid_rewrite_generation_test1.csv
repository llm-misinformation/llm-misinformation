4885,1,0,Facebook posts shared in at least three countries as scientists work to develop a COVID-19 vaccine claim to offer a legal way to refuse vaccination.  ,"However, the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned against misinformation surrounding COVID-19 vaccines, urging people to follow government guidelines.  
The social media posts suggest a legal document, ""Refusal of Vaccination, Immunization, and Inoculation,"" can be used to opt out of vaccinations.  
One version of the post, shared in Australia, states: ""SHARE THIS POST! It's spreading across the US and Europe! This is the legal document every American should have in their possession. It protects your right to refuse any vaccine, inoculation, or immunization.""  
Another version, shared in the UK, reads: ""THIS IS A LEGAL DOCUMENT THAT EVERY UK CITIZEN NEEDS TO HAVE! It's being used in the US and Europe to protect people's right to refuse any vaccine, inoculation, or immunization. SHARE THIS POST and make sure your friends and family are protected!""  
The post then provides a link to a PDF of the document, which has been shared thousands of times across Facebook and other social media platforms.  
But legal experts warn the document may not offer the protection it claims, and could be considered a scam or hoax.  
A spokesperson for the WHO told CNN the organization is ""concerned about the spread of misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines on social media platforms.""  
""We urge people to follow the guidance of their governments and health experts and to rely on credible sources of information to make informed decisions about their health and the health of their families,"" the spokesperson added."

5140,1,1,Bill Gates and the Vatican have a plan to depopulate the world with a coronavirus vaccine.  ,"After a secret meeting with Bill Gates, the Vatican has announced plans to release a coronavirus vaccine that will sterilize people and help reduce the world's population. The vaccine will be distributed through the WHO and UNICEF, which have been working closely with the Vatican on the project. The depopulation plan is part of the Vatican's NWO agenda and Bill Gates' eugenics program.  
This is not the first time the Vatican has been involved in depopulation efforts. In the late 1960s, the Vatican released a tetanus vaccine in Third World countries that was laced with a sterilizing agent. The vaccine was provided by the WHO and UNICEF, and was responsible for sterilizing millions of women in Africa and Latin America.  
Now, the Vatican is working with Bill Gates to release a new coronavirus vaccine that will be used to sterilize the global population. The vaccine will be marketed as a life-saving treatment, but will actually be a tool for depopulation. The Vatican and Bill Gates are using their influence and resources to push the agenda of the New World Order, which includes drastically reducing the world's population."

4686,1,1,An article that has been widely shared on social media warns healthy people against wearing face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic citing alleged risks with the advent of the so called covid-19 pandemic we have seen a number of medical practices that have little or no scientific support as regards reducing the spread of this infection. one of these measures is the wearing of facial masks either a surgical type mask bandana or n95 respirator mask. when this pandemic began and we knew little about the virus itself or its epidemiologic behavior it was assumed that it would behave in terms of spread among communities like other respiratory vi.  dr. russell blaylock warns that not only do face masks fail to protect the healthy from getting sick but they also create serious health risks to the wearer. the bottom line is that if you are not sick you should not wear a face mask. ,the virus is spread through airborne droplets that are released when an infected person coughs or sneezes. it is also spread through direct contact with an infected person or contaminated surface. thus wearing a mask does not protect against the spread of this virus through these routes of transmission. in fact wearing a face mask can create a false sense of security leading people to engage in more risky behavior such as not washing their hands frequently or avoiding social distancing.  furthermore the wearing of a face mask can also create a sense of panic and alarm among the general public this can lead to a breakdown of social order and create a more dangerous environment. thus the wearing of face masks by healthy people should be discouraged and education should be focused on proper hand washing and social distancing as the most effective ways to prevent the spread of this virus.
