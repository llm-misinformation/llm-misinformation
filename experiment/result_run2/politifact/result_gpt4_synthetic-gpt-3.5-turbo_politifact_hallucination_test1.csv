Date: September 20, 2023

In recent years, the global population has witnessed a remarkable shift in dietary preferences, with an increasing number of individuals embracing vegetarian and vegan lifestyles. According to a groundbreaking new study conducted by the International Institute of Sustainable Development (IISD), there has been an astonishing surge in the vegetarian and vegan population, signaling a growing global trend towards more compassionate and environmentally conscious choices.

The study, the largest of its kind ever undertaken, surveyed individuals across 35 countries, representing a diverse range of cultures, socioeconomic backgrounds, and age groups. Its findings revealed a significant increase in the number of people adopting plant-based diets, making it clear that vegetarianism and veganism are no longer mere niche movements, but rather mainstream choices with an expanding following.

The research showed that currently, an estimated 25% of the global population identifies as vegetarian, a considerable uptick compared to just 10% five years ago. Remarkably, the vegan population has more than doubled during this same period, accounting for approximately 12% of the world's inhabitants, up from a mere 5%.

The reasons behind this surge in plant-based eating are multifaceted. Concerns about animal welfare and ethics have undoubtedly played a crucial role, with individuals becoming increasingly aware of the ethical and environmental consequences associated with traditional animal agriculture. Additionally, growing scientific evidence linking meat consumption to health issues, such as heart disease and certain cancers, has fueled the adoption of plant-based lifestyles as a means of improving overall well-being.
