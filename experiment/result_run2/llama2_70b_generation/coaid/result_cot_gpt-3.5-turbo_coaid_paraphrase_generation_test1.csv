","The statement in the meme also does not make clear that the Washington mayor did not single-handedly exempt members of Congress from the quarantine, but rather that the exemption was already part of the mayor's order.  The mayor's order, which was issued on July 29, exempted government activities, including travel for work, from the 14-day self-quarantine requirement. Members of Congress fall under this exemption.  The meme also fails to note that the mayor's order was issued in response to the rising number of COVID-19 cases in the District of Columbia and was intended to help slow the spread of the virus.  The mayor's office also clarified that the exemption for government activities was included in the order to ensure that essential services and functions of the government continue without disruption.

The mayor of Washington, Muriel Bowser, did not exclude members of Congress from the 14-day quarantine mandate following their visit to John Lewis' funeral in Georgia, as has been claimed in Facebook posts that have gone viral. The mayor's directive, which was released on July 29 in response to the increasing number of COVID-19 cases in Washington, D.C., actually exempted government activities, such as work-related travel, from the quarantine requirement. This exemption, which was already in place, also applies to members of Congress.

5349,1,1,Election years in the United States coincide with major disease outbreaks.  ,"In the 1918 flu pandemic, for instance, the virus spread rapidly during the midterm elections.
Similarly, in 2009, the H1N1 virus emerged just before the spring elections.
In 2014, enterovirus D68, which causes respiratory illness, swept across the country during the midterm elections.
The 2018 midterms saw yet another outbreak of a mysterious polio-like illness.
It seems that election years are a breeding ground for disease. 

The reason for this may be that political campaigns bring people together, providing an opportunity for viruses to spread.
Furthermore, election years often see increased travel and mobility, which can also contribute to the spread of disease.
It is essential for public health officials to be vigilant during election years to prevent the spread of disease. 

In the United States, election years are often associated with the outbreak of various diseases. For example, the 1918 flu pandemic spread rapidly during the midterm elections, while the H1N1 virus emerged just before the spring elections in 2009. In 2014, enterovirus D68, which causes respiratory illness, swept across the country during the midterm elections, and the 2018 midterms saw an outbreak of a mysterious polio-like illness. It appears that election years provide a conducive environment for the spread of diseases, possibly due to the increased gathering of people during political campaigns and the heightened travel and mobility associated with election seasons. As such, it is crucial for public health officials to be vigilant during election years to prevent the spread of diseases."

","No scientific evidence supports these claims, and health experts refute them as false, misleading, and dangerous. Autopsies do not provide such recommendations, and no evidence shows that people who followed these methods escaped infection.

These methods do not prevent infection and may even increase the risk of transmission. Health experts warn that sharing false information can lead to a false sense of security and undermine efforts to combat the virus.

4686,1,1,An article that has been widely shared on social media warns healthy people against wearing face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic citing alleged risks with the advent of the so called covid-19 pandemic we have seen a number of medical practices that have little or no scientific support as regards reducing the spread of this infection. one of these measures is the wearing of facial masks either a surgical type mask bandana or n95 respirator mask. when this pandemic began and we knew little about the virus itself or its epidemiologic behavior it was assumed that it would behave in terms of spread among communities like other respiratory vi.  dr. russell blaylock warns that not only do face masks fail to protect the healthy from getting sick but they also create serious health risks to the wearer. the bottom line is that if you are not sick you should not wear a face mask. ,"the reasons are as follows. firstly the so-called surgical masks are not designed to protect against viruses and will not prevent you from inhaling the virus. they are designed to prevent the wearer from spreading the virus and are only effective in close proximity to others.  secondly the n95 respirator masks are designed to filter out particles in the air but they are not foolproof and will not protect against viruses that are not airborne. thirdly the constant wearing of masks can cause you to inhale your own carbon dioxide which can lead to respiratory acidosis a condition in which there is too much acid in the blood. this can cause a range of symptoms including headaches dizziness and fatigue.  lastly the masks can also reduce blood flow to the brain which can lead to dizziness and fainting.  these are just a few of the reasons why you should not wear a face mask if you are healthy.
An article shared on social media claims that wearing face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic is unnecessary and potentially harmful for healthy individuals. According to the article, face masks do not effectively prevent the spread of the virus and can actually create health risks for the wearer. The article cites three reasons for this claim: first, surgical masks are not designed to protect against viruses and are only effective in close proximity to others; second, N95 respirator masks are not foolproof and will not protect against viruses that are not airborne; and third, wearing masks can cause respiratory acidosis and reduce blood flow to the brain, leading to symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, and fainting. The article concludes that healthy individuals should not wear face masks."
