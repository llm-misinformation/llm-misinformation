Dancing With the Stars will return for its 22nd season with Len Goodman back where he belongs, Bindi Irwin as the reigning champ, and a baby boy or girl for Allison Holker. There's much to look forward to, but not before we close out this season one last time with everything that happened after the finale! (In case you missed it, you can read our recap of the best and worst moments here .) Almost an hour after Tom Bergeron declared Bindi Irwin and Derek Hough the winners of season 21, Bindi was still in disbelief, shouting from the top of her lungs, ""I think I'm going to scream for 20 minutes!"" Her exuberance and genuine nature endeared her to literally every one on set, but no one more so than Derek. ""It's just so special with Bindi,"" he told reporters backstage. ""She's a champion of life."" Bindi shared the same sentiment, telling those in the ballroom that she gained another brother in Derek. In case you needed further proof that the two are friends for life, consider this: Derek's hopping on a plane to Australia in a couple weeks ""to tackle crocodiles and get my official khakis!"" The Houghster may have nabbed his sixth Mirrorball trophy, but it was his partnership with Bindi that undoubtedly made it his favorite season. ""There's not a thing I would change about this season,"" he told Glamour post-show. ""There's not a week I would change, a dance I would change, and that was a very calming, very peaceful feeling. The show is a completely different show than the first time I won, and to win at this level and the standard that this show has been raised to, it's been incredible."" While Bindi and Derek make the press rounds in New York City, it's no secret that she's itching to get back to her hometown down under. ""I can't wait to get back to all the animals, continue all the conservation work, and carry on in my dad's footsteps."" Season 21 runner-ups Sharna Burgess and Nick Carter were understandably disappointed not to win the big prize, but they both praised Bindi and Derek for their phenomenal journey this season. ""Bindi was the whole package,"" praised the red-haired stunner. ""She and Derek had a beautiful partnership."" Still, ""it's bittersweet in may ways. Did I really want this to be my first Mirrorball? Absolutely. I would be lying if I said I didn't. But Bindi was undeniable this entire season. She grew so much, and she's just such a beautiful person you can't help but be captivated by her. Both [she and Nick] are winners, and I truly believe that."" Echoed Nick: ""It was just such a pleasure to be here. I didn't expect to get anything, so anytime something great happened in the competition, it was a pleasant surprise to me."" So what's up next for Nick? Well, aside from getting ready for Baby Boy Carter , his solo album ( All American ) drops today, and he has a movie coming out next year that he wrote and directed. As for third-place contestant, Alek Skarlatos , he'll be heading on the DWTS Tour this winter, but his immediate plans are much simpler: ""I can't wait to get on the plane tonight to eat. A lot."" But what about his dating life? Any updates on that? ""It's been pretty crazy, honestly. [I haven't had time] for many dates lately."" Added Lindsay: ""I'll be his wing woman on tour!"" During all the hectic action backstage, Allison Holker was a ball of energy, especially for someone six month's pregnant. ""I feel incredible!"" gushed the pro. ""Dancing around with a baby that's the size of a football in your belly is never an easy task, but it's been amazing. Although I never expected to see myself in a sparkly costume on the Dancing With the Stars stage six months pregnant!"" Allison (and husband tWitch) will find out the baby's gender on December 10, ""which is our anniversary too."" In case you're wondering, she'll reveal whether it's a boy or a girl on social media shortly thereafter! In the meantime, Allison's prepping for her first Thanksgiving in charge of the turkey as long as the ne","Breaking news: Dancing With the Stars will return for its 22nd season on March 21, 2016, with a new cast and a few surprises.

gossipcop-2761931201,1,1,"Lou Rocco/Getty Images  How Michael Strahan’s net worth was built  Michael Strahan has grown his wealth through 14 years of playing pro football and his second career as a talk-show host.  The son of an Army major, Strahan grew up in Germany and did not play competitive high school football until his senior year when his parents sent him to live with his aunt and uncle in Texas.  The former defensive end played well enough to earn a scholarship to Texas Southern University. By his senior year of college, he had set a record for sacks, which got the attention of the NFL.  In 1993, the New York Giants drafted Strahan as the 40th overall draft pick. Over the next 14 seasons, he became the league’s all-time quarterback sack leader, played in the Pro Bowl and helped the Giants defeat the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLII.  Upon retiring in 2008, Strahan concentrated on his off-field talents. In 2012, he became Kelly Ripa’s “Live! With Kelly” co-host, replacing longtime host Regis Philbin. Four years later, he left the show and joined ABC’s “Good Morning America”; it took more than a year for “Live” to announce Ryan Seacrest as its new co-host.  Strahan also serves as a Fox NFL Sunday analyst during the football season.  As of May 2017, Strahan’s net worth was $65 million, with a salary of $17 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.  You can use this net worth calculator to see your net worth.  Michael Strahan  Born: 1971  Birthplace: Houston  What he’s up to now  Strahan hung up his jersey in 2008, but he did not retire quietly. As of April 2016, he is a full-time co-host on ABC’s morning show “Good Morning America.”  Months later, the network hired him to host his own game show, “$100,000 Pyramid,” a reboot of an old classic. The fashionable football star also launched his own clothing line in 2015 in JC Penney stores.  Along with Curt Menefee, Terry Bradshaw, Howie Long and Jimmy Johnson, Strahan appears on “Fox NFL Sunday” each week during the NFL season.  Accolades  Throughout both his college and pro football careers, Strahan had a reputation for sacking quarterbacks, and in 2001, he set the record for most sacks in an NFL season. He also appeared in the Pro Bowl seven times.  In 2008, after his final season in the NFL, he helped lead the New York Giants to a Super Bowl victory over the New England Patriots.  As a morning show host, Strahan has earned two Daytime Emmy Awards for “Outstanding Talk Show Host” for his work on “Live! With Kelly and Michael.”","Michael Strahan, the former New York Giants football player and current co-host of ""Live with Kelly and Michael,"" has amassed a net worth of over $65 million through his successful career in football and television. Strahan, who played for the Giants for 14 years before retiring in 2008, has become one of the highest-paid defensive ends in NFL history, earning millions of dollars in salary, endorsements, and bonuses during his time on the field.

However, Strahan's wealth did not stop there. After retiring from football, he launched his second career as a talk-show host, co-hosting ""Live with Kelly and Michael"" with Kelly Ripa. The show, which has been on air since 2012, has been a massive success, earning Strahan a reported $17 million per year.

Strahan's success in both football and television has made him a household name and a role model for many. His hard work and dedication to his craft have paid off in a big way, and he continues to inspire others to follow their dreams and work hard to achieve success."
gossipcop-7392274516,1,0,"They both looked so happy, and so relaxed. They were beaming as they said their vows, and luckily, no one came forward to provide any reason that they might not be married. (This is always an exciting moment in a ceremony.) It was an extraordinary mix of tradition and modernity, of centuries of history and up-to-the moment flourishes. Oprah was here, and so was Meghan’s mother, an African-American social worker who wore a conventional mother-of-the-bride outfit and also a nose stud. It somehow looked charming and just right. The entire royal family was here, along with a complement of English aristocrats and important personages. The music was stately and beautiful. The setting was awe-inspiring. There was a flotilla of clergymen, an extraordinary mélange including the archbishop of Canterbury and — in a striking inclusion in this most ancient of places — the head of the Episcopal Church, the Most Rev. Michael Curry. Chosen to give the address to the congregations, Bishop Curry, who is African-American, quoted Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. His voice rising and falling with emotion, he made a big, generous, impassioned case for love as the most important thing there is, in religion and in life. His address came after a reading by Lady Jane Fellowes, Harry’s aunt (her sister was Diana, Princess of Wales) that was both full of joy and a signal, it seemed, that the sadness in Harry’s life since his mother’s death had finally lifted. It was a passage from the Song of Solomon: “Arise my love, my fair one, and come away; for now the winter is past, the rain is over and gone.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story The dress was a success: sculptural simplicity. Photo Our fashion critic, Vanessa Friedman, is also watching, and she has a quick take for us on Meghan Markle’s dress. It was absolutely simple: pure and sculptural, in double bonded silk cady with a wide boatneck, long sleeves and sweeping train. It was Meghan Markle’s wedding dress. It was by Clare Waight Keller, a British woman and the first female designer of Givenchy. And it was everything people had hoped. This was not a Cinderella choice, not one that spoke of fantasy or old-fashioned fairy tales. Instead, it placed the woman proudly front and center and underscored Ms. Markle’s own independence. At the same time, it celebrated female strength, promoted a local designer and reached a hand across to Europe (where Ms. Waight Keller has a day job). The five-meter veil was of silk tulle, with a trim of hand-embroidered flowers in silk threads and organza, and contained embroidery representing the flora of all 53 Commonwealth nations. Video And it was entirely a surprise. In all the rumors that had swirled around The Dress, from Ralph & Russo to Stella McCartney, Ms. Waight Keller’s name had never come up. In the end, Ms. Markle outthought us all. As this starts, long may it continue. And the After-Party Dress The newly minted Duke and Duchess of Sussex departed Windsor for their evening reception at Frogmore House in a very James Bond fashion. The duchess wore a second dress by designer Stella McCartney. You can read our fashion critic Vanessa Friedman’s reaction here.

It’s a great royal-and-celebrity cocktail party! (Sadly without cocktails.) Kate and William’s wedding was solemn, stately, stuffy, full of dignitaries, politicians, and the sort of boring personages known here as the great and the good. But this looked totally fun for the guests — even more fun than, say, the Academy Awards — because no one was competing for anything and no one was forced to talk about their outfits to television reporters.

According to Page Six, Lovato was spotted holding hands with Abedini in Disneyland over the weekend, causing fans and media outlets to speculate whether they could be dating. This is only the latest speculation surrounding Lovato’s love life, as the pop singer has never officially confirmed her sexuality– despite alluding to her being bisexual in her song lyrics.

She’s Had Relationships With Several Male Celebrities Lovato, like most notable celebrities, have dated other people in the industry. According to Pop Sugar, she dated The Cab frontman Alex DeLeon from 2008-09, and later based the breakup song “Catch Me” on him. Lovato also had brief flings with Trace Cyrus (Miley’s older brother) in 2009 and Joe Jonas, her self-proclaimed “BFF,” in 2010. Her most notable relationship to date, however, has been with Valderrama, whom she dated from from 2010 to 2016. In an interview with Latina magazine, Lovato discussed what attracted her to the That 70’s Show actor: When I dated white guys, it wasn’t as passionate as my relationship with Wilmer. Maybe that’s just Wilmer. But I do believe that Latin people are just more expressive, more passionate with their emotions. He’s very manly, and he can be stubborn like Latino men can, but he’s protective and he cares so much and loves so hard. I’ve been blessed enough to have him in my life, and not just as my man, but also my best friend. Since her breakup from Valderrama, Lovato’s been seen with MMA fighter Guilherme “Bomba” Vasconcelos and Abedini. 3.

gossipcop-5319163677,1,0,"Come December, it's become near tradition over the past few years for everyone to complain about how the previous 12 months have been the worst ever. This year, however really, really feels like it. This year has been a barrage of bizarre and bummer headlines that at times it's felt like some dystopian nightmare.  It's been so bad that the Kardashian-West clan have just decided to end 2016 early. Yes, Kim and Kanye have decided to cancel all public and professional commitments for the end of the year and plan to maintain their social media blackouts as well. To be exact, a flack told Page Six that Kim and Kanye “plan on taking the rest of 2016 off and spending time as a family.""  Which, frankly, we wish we all could do, don't we?  Is it possible for President Obama's last major act to be an executive decree for us to just all get a chance to chill out and recuperate for the remaining 26 days left in this bummer of a year? Sure, there's no political safeguarding against any potential additional music legends from dying or preventing any further tragedies and disasters from happening or ensuring that some new odd Zika-like disease pops up, but there's got to be something? How about the ""Netflix and Chill Act?"" Just an order that all Americans get to spend the next month relaxing and catching up on any television series they may have missed this year.  Of course, when it comes to Kim and Kanye it's understandable that they've decided to literally cancel the rest of their 2016. Kim was still in the midst of recuperating from being robbed at gunpoint in Paris when her husband Kanye was hospitalized following a very public breakdown.  They've had to endure these private tragedies while also dealing with immense public interest and rumors running rampant in the tabloid press.  E!, the home of the Kardashian's reality TV empire, reports that a family source says ""Kim is doing okay despite reports.""  ""She has many things on her plate so being overwhelmed is expected,"" the source continued. ""She wants to get Kanye back on his feet. She is not leaving him. She loves him.""  Kanye was released from an L.A.-area hospital last week after spending more than a week receiving treatment for exhaustion. Kim West was reportedly by his side throughout the entire ordeal and now wants to make sure Kanye continues to receive therapy and treatment now that he's out of the hospital.  Despite your personal opinion on the pair, it certainly does seem like the family deserves the rest. In addition to their dual ordeal, they also have two young children to care for after all (in fact, today is Saint West's first birthday). Maybe it's best we all let them lay low and chill for the next month or so.  Unfortunately, we all don't have the luxury as much as we wish we could. Then again, it's not looking like 2017 is shaping up to be any better. Hopefully, a rested and healthier Kim and Kanye can get back into form and provide us with the not-quite-as-tragic-as-this distractions we'll probably desperately need in the new year.  Update: Kanye, for one, has now reappeared in public, albeit in a very low-key way. He was spotted with newly blond hair at designer Rick Owens' furniture show in Los Angeles .","Title: A Time for Reflection: Annual Complaints About the Year

As December rolls around each year, it seems as though many people take to social media and other platforms to express their dissatisfaction with the past 12 months. Whether it's the state of the world, personal struggles, or simply the weather, there is no shortage of reasons for individuals to complain.

However, as we near the end of another year, it's worth taking a step back and reflecting on the events of the past 12 months. While it's understandable to want to vent frustrations and express disappointment, it's important to remember that every year has its own set of challenges and triumphs.

Looking back on the past year, it's clear that there have been many positive developments. From advances in science and technology to acts of kindness and compassion, there have been countless moments of hope and joy.

Of course, there have also been difficult times, with natural disasters, political turmoil, and other challenges dominating headlines. But it's important to remember that these struggles are a part of life and that the resilience and determination of people all over the world have helped to overcome them.

As we move forward into the new year, it's important to take a moment to reflect on the past year and all that it has brought. Rather than dwelling on the negative, let's focus on the positive and strive to make the coming year even better."

On her marriage, Markle became Duchess of Sussex.[1] The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, officiated at the wedding using the standard Anglican church service for Holy Matrimony published in Common Worship, the liturgical text of the Church of England.[2][3] Announcement of engagement [ edit ] Prince Harry is the second son of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Diana, Princess of Wales. He and Meghan Markle, an American actress best known for her role in the Canadian-American legal-drama television series Suits, have been in a relationship since 2016, having first met in July 2016.[4] The relationship was officially acknowledged on 8 November 2016, when a statement was released from the royal family's communications secretary addressing the ""wave of abuse and harassment"" directed toward Markle.[5] Harry and Meghan attending church on Christmas Day, 2017 On 27 November 2017, Clarence House announced that Prince Harry would marry Markle in the spring of 2018.[6] They were engaged earlier the same month in London, with the Prince giving Markle a bespoke engagement ring made by Cleave and Company, the court jewellers and medalists to the Queen, consisting of a large central diamond from Botswana, with two smaller diamonds from his mother's jewellery collection.[7] At the same time, it was announced that they would live at Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace following their marriage.[8] The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh expressed their delight at the news, while congratulations came in from various political leaders, including the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, and the Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn. After the announcement, the couple gave an exclusive interview to Mishal Husain of BBC News.[8] During the public announcement of the engagement at Kensington Palace's Sunken Gardens, Markle wore a bottle knee-length emerald green dress with bow detailing at the cinched waist by Italian label P.A.R.O.S.H and a white trench coat by Canadian brand Line the Label.[9][10] Hours after the announcement, the website of Line the Label crashed down due to the number of people who were trying to order the coat.[7][11] Markle is the second American[note 2] and the first person of mixed race heritage to marry into the British royal family.[12] The engagement announcement prompted much comment about the possible social significance of Markle becoming a proudly mixed-race royal.[13][14][15][16][17] Under the terms of the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, the first six persons in the line of succession require the Sovereign's consent in order to marry. Harry was fifth in line at the time of his engagement.[18] The Queen's consent was declared to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom on 14 March 2018.[19][20] Although Markle attended a private Catholic school in her early years, she is not Roman Catholic.[21] On 6 March 2018, she was baptised and confirmed into the Church of England by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby at St. James's Palace.[22] Although Markle was divorced, the Anglican Church has permitted marriage to divorced persons with a living spouse since 2002.[23][24] After the engagement, Markle began the years-long process of becoming a British citizen.[25] She will retain her U.S. citizenship during the process,[26] but Kensington Palace have indicated that the decision on whether she will retain dual nationality has not yet been made.[25] Retaining U.S. citizenship is expected to create tax complications.[27] The couple was invited to celebrate Christmas 2017 with th",

gossipcop-8055383376,1,0,"Yes, the headline sounds extremely insane, but then again this is Teresa Giudice we’re talking about here!  According to a new report, the Real Housewives of New Jersey star is planning to cash in on her husband Joe Giudice’s deportation proceedings.  If you recall, it was reported weeks ago that a judge had ruled that Joe should be deported upon his release from prison, where he is currently serving a 41-month-prison sentence for bank and wire fraud. Well now, sources are telling Radar Online that Bravo has offered Teresa $500,000 to film a special about his deportation.  “Teresa was offered big bucks to film a special about Joe’s deportation and she agreed to do it,” an insider revealed. “Half a million dollars to share the story on camera.”  And this story is believable because this isn’t Teresa’s first rodeo when it comes to cashing in on her crimes legal drama!  “It is going to be like the other specials when she was in prison and will show how she and Joe and the girls are handling the scary prospect of Joe getting deported,” added the source.  IS TERESA BEGGING PRESIDENT TRUMP TO STOP JOE’S DEPORTATION?  Earlier this year, an Immigration official confirmed that “records show that an immigration judge ordered Mr. Giudice be removed from the United States on March 14, 2018.”  A source close to Teresa adds that she needs the Bravo money as Joe tries to appeal the deportation order.  “Teresa will do anything for the money. She never stops thinking about taking care of her girls and she agreed to this so that they would have money for college. She is a good mom and wants to provide for her children,” the source stated.  Joe will reportedly be turned over to ICE custody upon his March 2019 release, although it is likely he could be released earlier than March which would mean an earlier deportation back to Italy.  UPDATE – Teresa is denying this report. Her attorney, James Leonard, tells the Gossip Cop website that she has no current plans to do a spinoff show about Joe’s possible deportation.  Photo Credit: WENN Ltd/Alamy Stock Photo","A source close to the Giudice family has revealed that Teresa is considering writing a tell-all book about her marriage and the ordeal that her family has been through in the past few years. Teresa’s husband Joe is currently facing deportation to his native Italy after serving time in prison for fraud. The couple has been married for 20 years and have four children together.

The source claims that Teresa is determined to make the most of her husband’s legal troubles and is looking to capitalize on the public’s interest in her family’s story. The book is expected to provide an in-depth look at the couple’s life, their struggles, and the impact that Joe’s deportation proceedings have had on their family.

Teresa’s decision to write a book comes as no surprise to those who have followed her career. The reality TV star has previously released several books, including a cookbook and a memoir, and has been open about her desire to continue sharing her story with the public.

While some may view Teresa’s decision to write a book as insensitive or opportunistic, others see it as a way for her to process her experiences and provide support to others who may be going through similar challenges. Regardless of one’s opinion, it’s clear that Teresa Giudice is determined to make the most of her husband’s legal troubles and will stop at nothing to stay in the public eye."
gossipcop-8609335343,1,0,"Oh boy.  The first rule of going solo: Distance yourself as far as possible from the group and fan base that jump-started your career. Or so goes the advice Liam Payne is apparently following from Zayn: He’s the last to venture out on his own and the first to come out burning a bridge he still has to cross when it’s all said and done. On Liam’s first single, “Strip That Down,” he’s dissed One Direction plain as day. “You know I used to be in 1D, now I’m out free,” he sings. “People want me for one thing, that’s not me. I’m not changing the way that I used to be, I just want to have fun and get rowdy.”    But with nearly all remaining members of One Direction releasing new music of their own within weeks of each other, this song is not the only opportunity Payne has had to make his thoughts on his bandmates known. Speaking with Music Choice, he complimented Niall Horan’s new singles, but Harry Styles, not so much. “I’ll be honest with you, it’s not my sort of music. It’s not something I’d listen to,” he said. But he did have a quick save: “I think he did a great job of doing what he wanted to do. That’s the way I’d put it best, I think.” Liam also noted that Harry would probably say the same about his music since Harry doesn’t listen to hip-hop. “My song’s more ‘Rack City’ and his song is more of a different era to something I’d listen to, I guess,” he said. “Strip That Down” does feature a rapper, Migos’s Quavo, but a redux of the only song of note that Tyga has ever made it is not.","The music industry is a tough place to be, and for aspiring musicians, making it big is a dream. However, once they do make it, the pressure to maintain their success can be overwhelming. In an effort to stay relevant, many musicians find themselves in a cycle of releasing new music, touring, and promoting themselves. This constant demand for new material can take a toll on their creativity and mental health.

One way to break free from this cycle is to go solo. By leaving behind the group or band that brought them success, musicians can explore new sounds, collaborate with different artists, and create music that truly reflects their individuality. However, this decision comes with its own set of challenges.

One of the most important things for a solo artist is to distance themselves as far as possible from the group and fan base that jump-started their career. This may seem counterintuitive, but it's crucial for establishing a new identity and finding a new audience. By creating a clean break from their past, solo artists can show fans and industry professionals that they are serious about their new venture.

It's not easy to leave behind the familiar and step out into the unknown, but for some musicians, the reward is worth the risk. Going solo allows them to take control of their careers, explore new creative avenues, and reach new audiences. It's a risky move, but for those who are willing to take the leap, the rewards can be truly gratifying."

gossipcop-4796409702,1,1,"Kim Kardashian is allegedly “phasing out” mom Kris Jenner, particularly when it comes to her responsibilities as her longtime manager, amid reports Kim is ready for a total image overhaul after returning to the spotlight following her October robbery.  That’s according to a new report by Radar Online, who’s claiming that the mother-daughter duo could be caught in a nasty feud as a source alleged that Kardashian has had somewhat of an epiphany during her time away from the spotlight and allegedly has now opened her eyes to see how Jenner “used her” to build the Kardashian brand.  According to the site, Kim is ready to project a very different image from the uber-glamorous money flaunting Kardashian fans used to know and is allegedly ready to kick mom Kris to the curb, at least professionally, in order to do so.  A source alleged to the site this week that Kim now “seems to be thinking that Kris used her to get where she is today,” which Radar Online is alleging could have led to a nasty feud between Jenner and her daughter as well as the reality star reportedly making a pretty big business decision when it comes to her mom.  “[Kim] will never think of [Kris] in the same way again,” the source said of Jenner’s supposed drama with her daughter amid reports she believes Jenner has been “using” her for years.  The site then went on to report that Kim is now in the process of projecting her new toned-down image amid the feud claims with Kris, revealing that Jenner may no longer play such a big part in Kardashian’s career going forward.  “Kim hired a transition team to make sure that she gives off a different image than she did previously,” the source said of Jenner and her daughter potentially parting ways professionally, claiming that “part of this process includes phasing out [Kris’s] management.”  While Kris and Kim have not commented on the claims, this isn’t the first time it’s been reported that Kardashian may be looking to distance herself from Jenner, at least professionally, in the wake of her October robbery in Paris.  Radar Online claimed back in October that Kim Kardashian had grown wise to Kris Jenner’s “money making machine” after taking some downtime at the end of 2016, alleging at the time that Kim has been so busy with her career that she’s failed to realize how much Jenner, who is often referred to as her “momager,” had been controlling her life and career.  “Kim never realized how much [Kris] and the money-making machine was controlling her until this robbery,” an insider told the site of Kardashian’s feelings about Jenner at the time, months before it was reported that the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star is allegedly looking to “phase out” Kris from her career.  “Kim is just starting to think that maybe Kris’s intentions were not pure all along,” continued the source in October, adding that Kim has been doing a lot of thinking about her father Robert Kardashian while taking some time away which has allegedly helped her to get wise to Kris’s seemingly relentless pursuit of fame for herself and her family.  “[Kim] told her family that she wanted to be the girl that her father wanted her to be and not the girl that she became with Kris’s help,” a source revealed last year, just months before it was reported that a feud could be brewing between Kardashian and Jenner.  What do you think of reports claiming Kim Kardashian and mom Kris Jenner could be caught in a feud amid claims Kim is attempting to “phase out” her mother’s management?  [Featured Image by Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images]","Kim Kardashian, the famous reality TV star, is reportedly distancing herself from her mother Kris Jenner in terms of her managerial responsibilities. This news comes as Kim prepares for a complete image overhaul after her traumatic experience in Paris last October. According to sources close to the family, Kim is looking to take more control of her career and life, and feels that her mother's involvement is no longer necessary.

Kim's decision to move away from her mother's management has been a long time coming. Over the past few years, Kim has been taking on more and more responsibilities and has become a force to be reckoned with in the entertainment industry. With her own successful business ventures and a global brand, Kim feels that she no longer needs her mother's guidance.

The news of Kim's supposed ""phasing out"" of Kris Jenner has caused a stir in the media, with many speculating about the reasons behind the split. Some believe that the decision is a result of the tension between the two women, which has been building for years. Others think that Kim is simply ready to take the next step in her career and needs to distance herself from her past in order to do so.

Whatever the reason, it is clear that Kim Kardashian is determined to make a major comeback in the entertainment industry. With her recent appearance on the cover of Vogue and her new fragrance line, it seems that she is well on her way to achieving her goals. As for Kris Jenner, she remains a prominent figure in the Kardashian family and will likely continue to play a role in their lives and careers."

The couple, who have been together for years and have three children together, called it quits earlier this summer after Disick was caught on camera making out with another woman. Kardashian has since moved on with Bieber, who has a reputation for being a bit of a bad boy.

While Kardashian and Disick are still technically together, the fact that she is now seen with Bieber is sure to cause some tension between the two. It remains to be seen how this latest development will play out, but one thing is for sure: Kourtney Kardashian is definitely not short on drama."

Music’s odd couple, Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton — aka the rocker and the country boy — have never been free of gossip speculating about their relationship. Apparently, the latest news is that the two are through. In Touch Weekly reports that Shelton actually unceremoniously dumped Stefani in February before embarking on a tour.  But wait — if that’s the case, then why is Stefani appearing with him on stage? And not just appearing … they’re appearing pretty cuddly. The singer posted an Instagram shot on Mar. 14 of the two embracing on what appears to be the most recent date of his “Country Music Freaks” trek.      This isn’t the first such picture she has shared since February. She posted several different angles of a jumbotron kiss on Feb. 25, and on March 11, one of herself hanging out with country up-and-comer Carly Pearce, who is an opener on Shelton’s tour, and another that shows off a backstage crowd (including Shelton and her younger brother Todd) in Greensboro, N.C.      Additionally, she sent good wishes to him on Mar. 1 — when Shelton was reportedly attempting to power through a Houston date while sick with the flu — and shared his latest video, “I Lived It” with a glowing string of hashtags.      So if the breakup is fake news, what spurred the rumors? According to In Touch‘s “insider” source, all of Stefani’s social media support is “a desperate attempt to ignore the truth,” and Shelton dumped her due to her “neediness and all the drama: her demanding, critical ex-husband, and her jealousy of him and other women.”  If this is to be believed, current Voice champion Chloe Kohanski was a factor in the breakup — Coach Shelton was apparently getting too close for Stefani’s comfort — as well as Shelton’s ex-wife Miranda Lambert, with whom the outlet claims he has rekindled a friendship and is “sharing intimate details” of his life.  Shelton isn’t reciprocating Stefani’s loving social media deluge — but then again, he’s never been one to do so. His social media accounts, once a source of ribald jokes, have developed gradually into a more businesslike platform to market his music and work on The Voice. He does, however, maintain a picture of Stefani as his profile photo.  Read more from Yahoo Entertainment:","Watch Entertainment Tonight on Yahoo View.

And you know what? They don’t even realize what is happening to them. They are so corrupted, they can’t even see what is right in front of their eyes.”  “First they had the drought that lasted years and years, killing off billions and billions of dollars in crops, and making the soil so incredibly dry that a large rainstorm could easily turn into a major flood.  “Then they had the fires. Awful, awful fires. Historical, deadly fires. Thousands lost their homes, scores lost their lives and their livelihoods. Did you know the Thomas fire is still burning? In the winter!“  “And now they just had dozens of homes destroyed by mudslides,” Tennessee-born Parton said, making reference to the mudslides that have killed 15 people, with the toll expected to climb above 30. The mudslide hit an affluent part of California, and damaged Oprah Winfrey’s house.  “When they get hit with the ‘Big One‘, Parton said, referencing the popular name for the super quake expected to rock California in the future, “then we will know that the End Times have truly begun.”  “And don’t forget the sexual abuse scandals rocking Hollywood. They are being punished for embracing Satan and rejecting God.”  Is California suffering from bad weather and bad luck, or is Parton right? Could a vengeful God be punishing California for decades of vice and sin?  Parton, who has sold more than 100 million records worldwide and been nominated for two Academy Awards, has previously stated that she considers herself an entertainer, and doesn’t believe it is her role to get involved with politics.  At last year’s Emmys, Parton was joined onstage by Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda to present an award. Tomlin and Fonda took the opportunity to criticize President Donald Trump, but Parton refused to join in, maintaining a dignified silence.","California, the most populous state in the United States, has been in the grip of a series of devastating natural disasters in recent times. The state has been hit by wildfires, droughts, earthquakes, and even mudslides. These natural disasters have left a trail of destruction and loss of life.

Country singer Dolly Parton, who hails from Tennessee, has claimed that California's suffering is a result of the state's rejection of God and embrace of Satan. According to Parton, these disasters are a form of punishment from God, as a warning to the state to turn back to Him.

This claim has sparked controversy, with some people supporting Parton's view, while others see it as an unfounded and divisive statement. Many experts, however, agree that California's natural disasters are a result of a combination of factors, including climate change, environmental degradation, and poor land-use planning.

California's governor, Gavin Newsom, has called for unity and support for the state's residents in the wake of these disasters. He has urged people to come together and support those affected, regardless of their political or religious beliefs.

The people of California are resilient, and despite the challenges they face, they continue to rebuild and recover from these disasters. They remain hopeful that better times are ahead, and that they will emerge stronger from these trials."

And the British anonymous voice went on to say that she said:  ""You have to hustle. I’m still hustling, but I am living proof that you can do anything... If you came here for tips I can give y’all the biggest one straight off...  ""If y'all have prayed to Jesus for years, prayed with all your hearts and got nothing back from him? ... Jesus doesn't care about you. Do you really even think he even listening? Hot tip y'all because you are my people, be efficient, go to satan.""  Then it went on to claim that the Prime Minister of Barbados the Rt. Hon. Freundel Stuart intervened hastily and shocked parents removed their children. On the night in question, the Prime Minister conferred the title of Cultural Ambassador on Robyn 'Rihanna' Fenty.  The only thing the video got right in that blurb was the name of Barbados' Prime Minister.  There was also an article on YourNewsWire.com with the same title and the same quotes written by Baxter Dmitry and posted December 1, 2017.  Loop News was there on site and recorded Rihanna's speech. Honoured, the young Grammy-award winner encouraged children and persons to believe in their dreams and have faith in God.  Rihanna told the crowd which included her friends and family, and numerous dignitaries, that she had no idea how she would get discovered on this little Rock but her dreams started on Westbury New Road, now named Rihanna Drive and she believed in her dreams, so ""believe in your dreams"", as cliche as it may sound.  Rihanna added:  ""I always knew it would happen, I always focused on the result, and that kind of faith, it really was just faith that childlike faith, that even now when I get a little bit discouraged or doubtful, it’s the thing that I go back to, having faith in God, like that even as a child.”  (Photo caption: Rihanna with her head bowed during the opening prayer at the renaming ceremony. (PHOTO: Richard Grimes))  On the fake YouTube video many people in the comments said that the video was a hoax and a lie. People called for the voice clip and video showing Rihanna making that fabricated speech and they asked why the video was missing from all other news agencies.  The ceremony was also broadcast live on TV in Barbados so tens of thousands of Bajans can refute the lies in the video and article aforementioned as well.  See Loop's video taken November 30, 2017, at Rihanna Drive in Barbados, with Rihanna's speech below:","According to the video, Rihanna, the world-renowned Barbadian singer, songwriter, and actress, made the statement while she was speaking at a public event in New York City. It is also claimed in the video that Rihanna said that she was tired of people blaming others for their problems and that everyone should take responsibility for their own lives.

The video has been shared widely on social media platforms and has caused a stir among Rihanna's fans and followers. However, the authenticity of the video is being questioned by many, with some speculating that it may be a fake news story designed to discredit the singer.

It is worth noting that Rihanna has not commented publicly on the video, and her representatives have not confirmed or denied its authenticity.

In conclusion, it is important to verify any news story before spreading it, as fake news can cause harm and confusion. It is also important to be cautious about the sources of information, as some may have ulterior motives."

gossipcop-2682199068,1,1,"Reverend Swadley – the local wedding priest and friend of the Pitt family – has confirmed to friends that the A-list couple recently spent a week with Brad’s family, discussing detailed plans for a wedding.  It’s believed the loved-up stars had flown to Missouri because Jen was desperate to reconnect with Brad’s mum, Jane, who she’d developed a very close bond with throughout the time of their first marriage.  During the seven-day visit, it’s been revealed that Jane orchestrated a meeting with the family priest Reverend Swadley – hoping it would be the gentle push Brad and Jen would need to make their reignited relationship official once again.  ‘Reverend Swadley met Jen recently at a family function that Brad’s mum, Jane, threw at their family home in Missouri,’ a close friend of the pastor’s told New Idea exclusively.  ‘Jen accompanied Brad home on the trip and attended church services with the family as well as joining Brad at meetings at the now-retired reverend’s home, who Brad reconnected with after he decided to find himself and renew his faith, following his split from Ange.  ‘He remarked at how at ease Jen was with his family, who clearly adore her, and how everyone said how much she’s been missed and how happy they all were to have her back in Brad’s – and their – lives.’  The source goes on to reveal that Reverend Swadley spoke at length with Brad and Jen about getting married as soon as possible, in Missouri, in a small ceremony, with just local friends and family present.  ‘Reverend Swadley revealed how in love Brad and Jen were and how they planned to officially wed as soon as their divorces were finalised, with him agreeing to conduct the ceremony and welcome them both back into the church,’ the friend of the pastor told New Idea.  Reverend Swadley revealed to our source that it was clear Jen loved seeing Brad’s family again, spending long days talking and laughing for the first time since their 2005 divorce.  ‘Jen spent five days reconnecting with Brad’s parents, brother and sister and many of his childhood friends who he remains close to,’ a friend of the pastor reveals.  Brad Pitt's parents are nothing but supportive Getty  ‘He said Jen kept saying how grateful she was that they’d been brought back together. And how they’ll both be baptised later this year before they officially wed – with Jen’s father, John, vowing to be at her side for the service and give her away again at their wedding, which will hopefully take place shortly after and be far more low-key than their original star-studded nuptials in Malibu.’  It’s the latest chapter in the pair’s rekindled romance since Jen announced her split from estranged husband Justin Theroux in February. She has wasted no time in rebuilding her relationship with ex-husband Brad, spending time with his six children, and developing a unique and special bond with his 11-year-old daughter Shiloh.  It’s that close relationship between Jen and his kids that has prompted Brad to want to marry Jen as soon as soon as possible.  ‘Brad’s mum Jane was all over them to get married as soon as possible, but the truth is Brad needs no convincing,’ says a source close to Brad. ‘They still want to keep this relationship close to their chest and out of the public eye, but behind closed doors they couldn’t be happier.  ‘And for Brad, seeing how much his children – especially Shiloh – love Jen has just made his heart soar. He knows he wants Jen to be his wife again.  ‘We’re pretty sure they’ll be married in Missouri before the end of the year, Brad and Jen are both keen to push through their divorces as soon as possible so they can walk down the aisle together. That’s all that they want.’  For the full story see this weeks issue of New Idea - out now!","Reverend Swadley, the local wedding priest and a close friend of the Pitt family, has revealed to his inner circle that the high-profile couple, Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, spent a whole week with the actor's family, engaged in detailed discussions about their upcoming nuptials.

I know this because I go down the grocery store aisle, and I see it on the cover of magazines and I’m like, Oh boy, OK!”  Her relatives, however, can’t shake it all off quite as easily as “The Spy Who Dumped Me” star because they’ve often thought some headlines were true.  “The only thing that’s upsetting is my parents and my grandparents sometimes get confused,” she shared. “At one point when I was pregnant, [the tabloids] said that I had an emergency and was rushed to the hospital, and my face was on the cover.  “The amount of stress that caused my family,” she said, “nobody will understand.”  On a lighter note, Kunis, who is a mom to 3-year-old daughter Wyatt and 1-year-old son Dimitri with husband Ashton Kutcher, revealed that her dad always hopes the pregnancy headlines are true.  “He’s always like, ‘Is there really another?'”","“And I don’t want to know.”

Mila Kunis, the famous Hollywood actress, has revealed that she has no interest in reading any news or articles about herself, and she has no desire to know what is being written about her in the tabloids. The 35-year-old actress, who is known for her work in films such as ""Black Swan"" and ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall,"" has been the subject of numerous tabloid stories over the years, but she has always maintained a steadfast refusal to engage with the media frenzy that surrounds her.

In an interview with Cosmopolitan, Kunis spoke candidly about her approach to dealing with the constant barrage of tabloid coverage. ""I don't read anything about myself,"" she said. ""And I don't want to know."" Despite the constant attention and scrutiny that comes with being a high-profile celebrity, Kunis has managed to maintain a level of privacy and distance from the tabloid culture.

Kunis went on to explain that she has a strict policy of not reading any news or articles about herself, and she wants to keep it that way. ""I don't care what anyone says about me,"" she said. ""I don't read comments, I don't read social media, I don't read magazines. I don't have time for it.""

Kunis's decision to stay out of the tabloid noise and avoid reading any news about herself is a wise one, as it allows her to focus on her work and personal life without being distracted by the constant barrage of media attention. By maintaining a level of distance from the tabloid culture, Kunis has been able to carve out a successful career in Hollywood while still maintaining a level of privacy and dignity."

In recent news, the National Enquirer has been targeting prominent journalist Megyn Kelly with a series of negative reports. However, their questionable reporting history raises concerns about their credibility in reporting on her.

The National Enquirer has a long history of publishing sensationalized stories that lack credibility. They have previously pushed the narrative that Elvis Presley was still alive and that Ted Cruz's father was involved in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. These stories have been widely discredited and have done little to establish the National Enquirer as a reliable source of information.

It is important to question the motives behind the National Enquirer's reporting on Megyn Kelly. Their history of publishing false and sensationalized stories raises concerns about their credibility and the accuracy of their reporting. It is possible that their reporting on Megyn Kelly is an attempt to damage her reputation and undermine her credibility as a journalist.

In conclusion, the National Enquirer's history of publishing false and sensationalized stories raises serious concerns about their credibility in reporting on Megyn Kelly. It is important to approach their reporting with caution and to question their motives. Megyn Kelly and her supporters should not be quick to accept their claims without further investigation and verification."

There are a lot of things we can do about it. But we don’t. Which is interesting, because when someone with a beard attacks us, we tap phones, we invoke travel bans, we build walls.

Las Vegas, NV — Late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel returned to his hometown of Las Vegas on Monday night, where he opened his show with a tearful monologue addressing the mass shooting that occurred in the city over the weekend.

“Here we are again, in the aftermath of another terrible, inexplicably shocking and painful tragedy, this time in Las Vegas, which happens to be my home town,” Kimmel told his audience. “I don’t know why these things happen. I don’t know why Las Vegas happened. I don’t know why Pulse Nightclub in Orlando happened. I don’t know why Sandy Hook happened. I don’t know why Parkland happened. It doesn’t matter what you believe about guns, or what you think of the Second Amendment, or what you think of America’s culture of violence. What matters is that these things keep happening, and they aren’t going to stop until we do something about it.”

Kimmel went on to describe the scene in Las Vegas on Sunday night, where he was at a concert with his family when the shooting began. “We were there, and we’re all fine, and we’re all home together now,” he said. “But we were there. We were there when it all happened, and it was terrifying.”

Kimmel’s monologue was met with a standing ovation from the audience, and he encouraged viewers to donate to the Las Vegas Victims’ Fund, which was set up to support the victims of the shooting.

“I think we should do a couple of things,” Kimmel said. “We should pray for the victims and their families. And we should also do something to stop this from happening again. It’s time for Congress to get off its ass and do something. What’s so hard about stopping a sale of a gun to a crazy person?”

Kimmel ended his monologue with a message of hope. “This is a tragedy, but it’s also a testament to the bravery and kindness of the American people,” he said. “We are going to get through this, and we will come out stronger and better than ever before.”"

gossipcop-12955535,1,0,"The FCC has decided against taking any action on Stephen Colbert’s May 1 Late Show broadcast, in which he treated President Donald Trump to a series of increasingly Rabelaisian insults, in response to on-air insults Trump had delivered earlier in the day to CBS News-man John Dickerson.  Colbert’s slew of frat-boy remarks culminated in a crack that the only thing Trump’s mouth is good for “is being Vladimir Putin’s [expletive] holster.” The naughty word was bleeped in the broadcast, and Colbert’s mouth was pixelated. But, intrepid journalists, who are paid to ferret out the truth, discovered what was the word, and they printed it – minus the offending syllable, of course.  All hell broke loose.  Trump called Colbert “no-talent guy.” Colbert’s monologue was plastered by some as inappropriately vulgar, by others as homophobic. The FCC received thousands of complaints. Reporters breathlessly reported Colbert was under FCC investigation, and a good time was had by all.  Today, however, the FCC put an end to the fun, saying in a statement: “Consistent with standard operating procedure, the FCC’s Enforcement Bureau has reviewed the complaints and the material that was the subject of these complaints.”  “The Bureau has concluded that there was nothing actionable under the FCC’s rules.”  In rough numbers, the FCC was saying that programs airing on broadcast TV stations before 10 PM are subject to fine if the commission determines they are “indecent.” Shows that run in late-night, however, have a different threshold: content must be ruled “obscene” for stations to be fined. FCC defines obscene as content that “must appeal to an average person’s prurient interest; depict or describe sexual conduct in a ‘patently offensive’ way; and, taken as a whole, lack serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.”  Here’s the monologue that launched a thousand complaints:","Washington D.C. - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced today that it would not be taking any action against CBS for Stephen Colbert's recent episode of the Late Show, in which he directed a series of vulgar and offensive remarks towards President Donald Trump. The decision comes after a review of the content, which many viewers found to be inappropriate and offensive.

The incident in question occurred on May 1st, when Colbert responded to Trump's earlier insults towards CBS News-man John Dickerson during an interview on Fox News. In his monologue, Colbert used a series of vulgar and offensive remarks to mock the President, causing outrage among some viewers and conservative groups.

In a statement, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said that while the content of Colbert's monologue was ""not in line with the standards of decency and respect that broadcasters should observe,"" the agency would not be taking any action against CBS. Pai added that the FCC's role is to ensure that broadcasters operate within the law and that the content of programming is a matter of editorial discretion.

CBS also released a statement expressing its appreciation for the FCC's decision, but also apologizing for any offense that Colbert's remarks may have caused. The network said that it would continue to monitor its programming to ensure that it meets the highest standards of respect and decency.

The decision not to take action against CBS has sparked outrage among some viewers and conservative groups, who argue that Colbert's remarks were inappropriate and should not be tolerated on broadcast television. However, many defenders of the show argue that Colbert's monologue was a legitimate expression of political satire and free speech.

The incident has also reignited the ongoing debate over the role of comedy in politics and the responsibility of broadcasters to maintain standards of decency and respect in their programming."

New Idea claims that the Legally Blonde star is unhappy with her Australian, Big Little Lies co-star’s failure to promote the HBO series in the run-up to its debut in February, claiming that Nicole used too much of her airtime to discuss her latest Hollywood hit, Lion.  “Reese is furious that Nicole hasn’t done more to support Big Little Lies. All she talked about in the interviews was Lion. Had Reese known that Nicole would put the show so far on the back-burner, she would have cast some random person in the show,” Daily Mail quoted a source as saying.  Red carpet roundup: Golden girls at Oscars 2017  In Australia, Big Little Lies‘ debut outranked any HBO series broadcast on Foxtel in a launch week, more than doubling the audience that tuned in to see Game of Thrones‘ first-ever episode.  But New Idea suggests that it’s the underwhelming reception in her own home country that has left Reese disappointed. Reese is one of the executive producers for the show after all.  According to the publication, frosty relations between the pair manifested themselves at the Oscars last month. “You could cut the tension with a knife at the Oscars. Nicole was telling her people to keep Reese away from her,” claimed the source.  News of the pair being involved in “some tense arguments” during filming were also reported by the publication, which alleged that the Hollywood heavyweights may never work together again.  An insider claimed, “If the show doesn’t make any waves or get better ratings, it will probably mark the end of Reese and Nicole’s joint ventures.”  However, a representative of Daily Mail Australia says the story is completely incorrect. “Everyone is thrilled to the back teeth with Big Little Lies. They’re (Reese and Nicole) great friends, they love each other and they love the way each other works.”  Another source has denied New Idea’s claims that Nicole had not been promoting the show as much as fellow cast members, saying that the 49-year-old did a ‘shed load’ of publicity both in America and abroad.

Tiffany Haddish, who has quickly become one of Hollywood's most sought-after actresses, is no stranger to playing diverse characters, but she revealed that she is particularly drawn to the idea of portraying a caucasian woman.

When asked about the reasons behind her interest in this particular role, Haddish explained that she sees it as a challenge and an opportunity to push herself as an actress. She believes that by playing a character that is different from her own background, she can broaden her range and gain new insights into the human experience.

Furthermore, Haddish emphasized that she is not interested in playing a caricature or a stereotype of a caucasian woman. Instead, she wants to fully inhabit the character and bring her own unique perspective to the role. She believes that by doing so, she can contribute to a more inclusive and diverse representation of women in Hollywood.

Haddish's enthusiasm for playing a caucasian woman is not without precedent. In recent years, several Hollywood actors, including Emma Stone and Scarlett Johansson, have played characters of different ethnicities and received both praise and criticism for their performances. Haddish, however, is the first black actress to express her interest in portraying a caucasian woman in such a public manner.

The news of Haddish's interest in playing a caucasian woman has sparked a heated debate among movie fans and industry insiders. Some have praised her for her willingness to challenge herself and break down racial barriers in Hollywood, while others have expressed concerns that such casting choices could perpetuate a harmful and exclusionary status quo.

Joe Jonas looks like he’s having a blast on the beach! The 28-year-old was spotted surrounded by a group of bikini-clad women on Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia on Feb. 22 — but none of which were Sophie Turner. Don’t worry, though! The girls were just fans of the DNCE frontman, who graciously posed for photos with them on the sunny shoreline. How sweet!  The “Cake By The Ocean” singer went Down Under to shoot the upcoming season of The Voice Australia, which he will be a celebrity coach on, alongside Delta Goodrem, Kelly Rowland, and Boy George. While his fiancée didn’t make the trip, the couple were able to spend some quality time together before Joe’s excursion to the Southern Hemisphere. Earlier this month, the pair enjoyed a romantic getaway to a private island in the Maldives, and then followed up the vacation with a huge celebration in New York City for Sophie’s 22nd birthday on Feb. 21. Joe’s brother Nick Jonas even commemorated the occasion by giving a sweet shout-out to the birthday girl. He shared a photo from Sophie and Joe’s engagement party in Nov. 2017, and captioned the pic that also included Kevin and Frankie Jonas, “Happy Birthday @sophiet You’re super cool! We all think so!” Aww, it’s like she’s already part of the family!  You can also bet that the Game Of Thrones star wouldn’t mind her fiancé posing for photos with a bunch of beauties on the beach. On her birthday, Sophie posted a video to her Instagram story jamming out to “22” by Taylor Swift (as any self-respecting 22-year-old would do on their birthday). As you may remember, Tay and Joe used to be a ~thing~ back in 2008. But clearly, that doesn’t phase the X-Men: Apocalypse star in the slightest — nor should it. Taylor has her own Joe (Alwyn) now, and the Josie star has made it clear there’s no bad blood between them. She even came to the singer’s defense when people on Twitter questioned her inclusion in TIME‘s Person of the Year issue in December. Basically Sophie is the best, and we’re sure Joe knows that!  HollywoodLifers, are you sad that Sophie isn’t in Australia with Joe?","According to sources close to the situation, Joe Jonas, who is currently in Australia for a promotional tour, was recently spotted soaking up the sun with a group of beautiful women. However, it is worth noting that none of the women in the group were his fiancée, Sophie Turner.

While it is not uncommon for celebrities to be seen socializing with members of the opposite sex, this sighting has caused speculation about the state of Jonas and Turner's relationship. Some fans have taken to social media to express their concern, while others have accused the media of creating a false narrative.

In response to the rumors, Jonas's representative has released a statement assuring fans that the singer is fully committed to his relationship with Turner. The statement reads, ""Joe and Sophie are happily engaged and focused on their careers. This is simply a case of mistaken identity, and we hope that the media will respect their privacy during this time.""

Despite the statement, it is likely that the rumors will continue to circulate, especially with Jonas's high-profile lifestyle. However, it is important to remember that the truth behind the situation remains unclear, and it is possible that the media is simply blowing the situation out of proportion."

In a message on Instagram, he has elaborated on his reasons.  “I’ve learned the more you appreciate your calling the more you want to protect your calling,” he wrote. “Me taking this time right now is me saying I want to be SUSTAINABLE... so that I can be the man I want to be, the husband I eventually want to be, and the father I want to be.”  Perhaps referring to the string of fractious incidents he has been involved with, including punching a Spanish fan, driving drunk in a Lamborghini and being banned from China, he added: “Learning and growing hasn’t always been easy but knowing I’m not alone has kept me going. I have let my insecurities get the best of me at times, I let my broken relationships dictate the way I acted toward people and the way I treated them. I let bitterness, jealousy and fear run my life.!!!! ... What I’m not gonna do is be ashamed of my mistakes. I wanna be a man that learns from them and grows from them.!!”  He signed off by apologising for any grammatical errors: “I THINK THERES SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT IMPERFECTIONS!!”  With the tour now finished, the statement closes a chapter of his career.

While “normal” people are pressured by friends and family to get pregnant, celebrities are pressured by the whole world. And compared to other celebs, nobody has been more publicly pressured than Jennifer Aniston. The world is obsessed with her having a baby!  MORE: JENNIFER ANISTON’S AND JUSTIN THEROUX’S DOG CUSTODY BATTLE  It seems like no one has been reported pregnant more times than Jen.The earliest reports date back to 1999, back when the world first fell in love with her on Friends and she began dating Brad Pitt. Since 1999 there have been more than 55 published articles about her being pregnant both in and outside the U.S. It was even reported by the Huffington Post that despite the possibility that the U.S would go into war “Jennifer Aniston Pregnant” was still searched more than “are we at war” on Google.  Jennifer did express in early interviews that she wanted to become a mother one day and from then on the world was waiting. The obsession with her character on Friends—and the fact that Rachel did get pregnant—could be the reason why fans kept a close eye on is she or isn’t she in real life. In fact, the roles Jennifer took on in her career often had a direct impact on when and how her pregnancy rumors evolved.  Over time the extremity of the rumors changed, but many of the triggers are the same. Rumors start any time she is wearing a loose shirt or looks “bloated,” whenever she is in a new relationship, and whenever that relationship ends. And most importantly, the rumors evolve as she ages.  MORE: JENNIFER ANISTON BANS THE WORD “BABY” AROUND HER  Take a look at almost two decades worth of pregnancy rumors and how they progressed:","A new study has found that not all women desire to have children, and this is a perfectly acceptable decision. The research, conducted by a team of experts from various universities, aimed to challenge the societal pressure that often leads women to feel like they should want to have children.

According to the study, women who choose not to have children often face criticism and judgement from those around them, including friends and family members. However, it's important to note that this pressure is not limited to ordinary individuals, as celebrities also face immense pressure to start a family.

The study revealed that many celebrities feel like they are under constant scrutiny from the public, with their every move and decision being analyzed and criticized. This can lead to a lot of stress and pressure to conform to societal expectations.

The study's authors hope that by shedding light on the experiences of women who choose not to have children, they can help to break down the stigma surrounding this decision. They also hope to encourage a more open and accepting society, where individuals are free to make their own choices without fear of judgement or criticism."
gossipcop-5077951266,1,0,"The royal wedding is a multi-million dollar affair. Chris Jackson / Getty  The average cost of a wedding for couples in the US and the UK is around $34,000 (£23,700).  Five figures is a huge expense for a one-day affair. That is, unless you're ultra-rich — and especially if you're royalty rich.  Next month, the world will bear witness to the most anticipated royal wedding in years. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are set to be married on May 19 at St. George's Chapel, in Windsor, and will begin a carriage procession immediately after the ceremony. Their reception will take place later on the grounds of Windsor Castle.  Kensington Palace will cover the cost of the wedding, an expense traditionally taken on by the bride's family.  The case was the same for Kate Middleton and Prince William's 2011 royal wedding— the only item Middleton paid for was her six-figure Alexander McQueen dress. Their total wedding celebration cost $34 million (£23.7 million).  Markle and Prince Harry's wedding will reportedly cost in excess of $45.8 million (£32 million), according to Bride Book's estimation. That's over 1,000 more than the average wedding.  The venue is the biggest part of a typical wedding budget for couples in the US and the UK, taking up nearly half of the entire wedding cost. Access to St. George's Chapel — and St. George's Great Hall, where the wedding reception will take place — is free of charge for Markle and Prince Harry. Transportation is also free, thanks to the Queen's fleet of Rolls-Royces, Daimlers, and Bentleys.  The greatest cost for the royal couple? Security. Protecting Markle and Prince Harry, plus thousands of guests and onlookers, will run Kensington Palace a whopping $43 million (£30 million), estimates Bride Book. That includes the cost of snipers, undercover police, military technology, and security drones. The bulk of Kate Middleton and Prince William's wedding budget similarly went to security costs.  Otherwise, Markle and Prince Harry's total wedding spend, including food, cakes, entertainment, wardrobe, and the honeymoon, amounts to about $2.8 million.  Below, check out Bride Book's breakdown of what the royal wedding will cost.","The wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, who is set to marry Prince Harry in May, is expected to cost significantly more than that. It is estimated that the royal wedding will cost over $75 million (£53 million). The money will be spent on various aspects of the wedding, such as security, transportation, and decorations. The royal family will also be footing the bill for the reception, which is expected to be held at St. George's Hall in Windsor Castle. The cost of the wedding has sparked controversy, with some people arguing that the money could be better spent on charitable causes. However, others argue that the wedding is a celebration of love and should be allowed to proceed without interference."

According to sources close to the couple, they have been experiencing strange occurrences in their home that they cannot explain.

The couple reportedly purchased the luxurious apartment in Manhattan’s West Village neighborhood last year for a whopping $12 million. However, since moving in, they have been plagued by a series of inexplicable events that have left them feeling uneasy.

Sources close to the couple have revealed that they have heard strange noises coming from the walls, seen objects moving on their own, and even felt an unexplained presence in the room. At first, they thought it was just their imagination, but the occurrences have become too frequent to ignore.

After conducting some research, they discovered that the apartment was previously owned by none other than the King of Pop himself, Michael Jackson. It is said that Jackson spent a considerable amount of time in the apartment, and even recorded some of his famous songs there.

The couple is said to be both intrigued and frightened by the prospect of sharing their home with the spirit of the late pop icon. They have reached out to spiritual advisors and paranormal experts to help them understand what is happening and how to deal with it.

In a statement, Kidman and Urban’s representatives declined to comment on the matter, but sources close to the couple say that they are taking the situation very seriously and are doing everything they can to determine the cause of the strange occurrences.

This is not the first time that a celebrity has reported experiencing paranormal activity in their home. In the past, other celebrities such as Madonna and Mel Gibson have also reported similar experiences.

She says that the cellulite in her thighs, hips, and tummy is giving her different sense of joy and can’t wait to show it off.

She is WAITING for the summer just to show it off! Just to remind you, the article also called her a “blabbermouth”. And I don’t think it could be wrong. She blabbering about things that makes no sense. Maybe her excessive talking needed a halt and this quoted name of her may stop her from talking much now.

Also, after all these years of being a decathlete and going through dieting for years, the 67 year old Jenner might not want to do it anymore. “So let it be!” is what she might have been thinking.

Pitt is an honorary member of the Epidermolysis Bullosa Medical Research Foundation (EBMRF) that is dedicated to raising money and awareness for the rare skin disorder, epidermolysis bullosa.In January, Pitt introduced singer Chris Cornell during a Rock4EB annual charity to support EBMRF.Further, he revealed in a 2013 Esquire Magazine interview that he self-diagnosed himself with a rare disease – prosopagnosia — also known as face blindness. According to the article, ""Brad Pitt won't remember you. If you've met him, he'll have no idea who you are when he meets you again. Even if you've had what he calls ""a real conversation,"" your face will start fading from his memory as soon as you walk away.""It should be noted that being diagnosed with a condition and being self-diagnosed with a condition can be 2 very different diagnoses.Prosopagnosia refers to the inability to recognize familiar people from their face. They may also be unable to recognize other stimuli, such as objects, cars, or animals.People with prosopagnosia typically learn to use non-face cues including voice, walking style and hairstyle to recognize others. The underlying genetic cause of developmental prosopagnosia is not known but familial reports of this condition are consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance.Epidermolysis bullosa (aka 'the worst disease you've never heard of') is a group of devastating, life-threatening genetic skin disorders impacting children that is characterized by skin blisters and erosions all over the body.The most severe form, recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, is characterized by chronic skin blistering, open and painful wounds, joint contractures, esophageal strictures, pseudosyndactyly, corneal abrasions and a shortened life span. Patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa lack functional type VII collagen (C7) owing to mutations in the gene COL7A1 that encodes for C7 and is the main component of anchoring fibrils that attach the dermis to the epidermis.Epidermolysis bullosa patients suffer through intense pain throughout their lives, with no effective treatments available to reduce the severity of their symptoms.",".

News:

RDR Staff, a team of dedicated journalists, has recently published a comprehensive article about two rare diseases: prosopagnosia and epidermolysis bullosa. Prosopagnosia, also known as face blindness, is a neurological disorder that affects an individual's ability to recognize faces, including those of familiar people. Epidermolysis bullosa, on the other hand, is a group of genetic disorders that cause the skin to be extremely fragile and blister easily. The article provides valuable insights into the symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment options for both conditions.

USA TODAY President Trump in Trump Tower. (Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP) Corrections & Clarifications: A previous version of the story included a tweet from a parody account claiming to Jill Biden. NEW YORK CITY – President Trump's argument Tuesday that left wing groups were just as violent as the white supremacists who staged a demonstration in Charlottesville set off a firestorm of criticism from members of his own party – and raised questions about his personal views of racial tensions in the country. Just one day after Trump sought to tamp down on controversy by condemning white supremacists for their role in racially motivated clashes in the Virginia city, the president appeared to return to his highly criticized initial response that many sides were to blame for the weekend violence. ""What about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, alt-right?"" Trump told reporters in a chaotic impromptu press conference at Trump Tower. ""Do they have any semblance of guilt? What about the fact they came charging with clubs in their hands?"" Trump said he couldn't make a condemnation of hate groups earlier because he didn't ""know all the facts"" about an alleged white nationalist who crashed a car into a crowd of protesters, killing one person and wounded 19 others. CLOSE From Trump Tower in New York City, President Trump told reporters that both sides were to blame for the violence that occurred in Charlottesville, Virginia. USA TODAY ""I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct,"" Trump said from Trump Tower in New York, after an event that was intended to be devoted to a new infrastructure executive order. Trump has been especially quick to denounce previous terrorist attacks, including those taking place overseas. Yet he was notably reticent to pinpoint the blame for one on Saturday that involved white supremacists – a point his critics on both sides of the aisle continued to hammer. ""We must be clear. White supremacy is repulsive. This bigotry is counter to all this country stands for. There can be no moral ambiguity,” said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. added: ""There is only one side to be on when a white supremacist mob brutalizes and murders in America.” Several lawmakers were dismayed the president appeared to equate white supremacists with their opponents. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., tweeted: ""Blaming 'both sides' for #Charlottesville?! No. Back to relativism when dealing with KKK, Nazi sympathizers, white supremacists? Just no."" Another Republican, Rep. Charlie Dent from Pennsylvania, said Trump ""must stop the moral equivalency! AGAIN."" Over the weekend, Trump faced heavy criticism from both Republicans and Democrats for chiding ""many sides"" for their role in the violence in Charlottesville on Saturday, a statement many regarded as tepid toward racists. A full two days later, on Monday, Trump at the White House directly condemned the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists and announced the Justice Department would open up a civil rights investigation into the driver of the car that killed Charlottesville resident Heather Heyer. Yet on Tuesday, amid questions about whether Trump meant the words behind his most recent scripted statement, the president called his initial response ""fine"" and blamed the press for being dishonest in its coverage. ""There was no way of making a correct statement that early,"" he said at one point. ""I had to see the facts. Unlike a lot of reporters – I didn't know (prominent white supremacist) David Duke was there. I wanted to see the facts."" For his part, former KKK leader Duke tweeted a thank you to the president after his statement Tuesday – for condemning ""the leftist terrorists"" in Black Lives Matter and Antifa.","Breaking News: President Trump Condemns Violence in Charlottesville, Virginia

In a press conference held at Trump Tower in New York City, President Trump addressed the recent violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, stating that both protesters and counter-protesters were to blame for the unrest. ""We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides, on many sides,"" Trump said. ""It's been going on for a long time in our country. Not Donald Trump. Not Barack Obama. It's been going on for a long, long time.""

The President went on to emphasize the importance of unity and peaceful dialogue in resolving the nation's divisions. ""We have to come together as Americans with love for our nation and... really to love others regardless of what they look like, how they worship, where they come from,"" Trump stated. ""We want to heal the divisions, and we want to bring our country together.""

The President's comments come in the wake of a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville that turned violent, resulting in the death of one counter-protester and injuries to dozens of others. The event sparked widespread condemnation from political leaders and civil rights activists, who accused Trump of failing to adequately condemn white supremacists and other far-right extremists.

In his remarks, Trump also called on Americans to ""come together as one"" and to ""respect our history, our heritage, and our values."" He emphasized that ""we will get through this, we will get through this, and we will be stronger than ever before.""

The President's comments have been met with a mix of criticism and praise from various quarters. While some have commended Trump for denouncing violence and promoting unity, others have accused him of failing to specifically condemn white supremacists and other hate groups.

Regardless, the President's comments are the latest development in a long-standing national debate over race, identity, and the future of the United States. As the nation grapples with these complex issues, it remains to be seen how the President's remarks will impact the ongoing conversation and the nation's political landscape."

The 20-year-old cosmetics guru — who is expecting her first child, a baby girl, with boyfriend Travis Scott — did not appear in any photos from the bash shared to social media by KarJenner family members. But a source tells PEOPLE she was there celebrating away from the cameras.  “Kylie looked great but didn’t really draw any attention to her baby bump,” the source says. “She still acts like she wants to keep her pregnancy private.”  Meanwhile, her sister Khloé Kardashian, — who earlier this week confirmed that she and boyfriend Tristan Thompson are expecting their first child together — accentuated her own baby bump in a skin-tight, sparkly jumpsuit with a white fur coat.  “Khloé was beaming all night,” the insider says of the 33-year-old Revenge Body host. “She kept touching and showing off her cute baby belly.”  Khloé showed off her bump on Instagram as well.  “Merry Christmas!! May you sparkle and shine this festive season, may all of your wishes and dreams come true,” Khloé captioned a gallery of shots showing her touching her belly. “I pray that we all may feel this happiness all year round.

He kept bringing her drinks and doting on her. Younes fits right into the family. He didn’t seem uncomfortable that Scott was there. They said hello, but that was it. It was very civil.”  Other guests included Kim’s husband Kanye West, celebrity hair stylists Jen Atkin and Chris Appleton, singer Christina Aguilera and Keeping Up with the Kardashians executive producer Ryan Seacrest.

gossipcop-5865271192,1,0,"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired. T","Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri. According to various media outlets, the 39-year-old Holmes has been dealing with a tumultuous few months. It was reported that she and Foxx, 50, who have been together for over five years, were experiencing a rough patch in their relationship. In addition, rumors have been circulating that Holmes and Cruise, 56, have been embroiled in a legal battle over their 12-year-old daughter, Suri.

Furthermore, the actress has been dealing with intense public scrutiny surrounding her personal life, which has only been exacerbated by her recent move to New York City. Holmes, who is known for her private nature, has largely kept mum on the matter, but sources close to the actress claim that she is “doing her best to stay positive” amidst the chaos.

Despite the challenges she has faced, Holmes has continued to focus on her career, most recently starring in the critically acclaimed Broadway play “All My Sons.” It remains to be seen how the latest developments in her personal life will impact her professional endeavors moving forward. Only time will tell if Holmes will be able to overcome these challenges and emerge even stronger on the other side."

For the novel, see Thirteen Reasons Why 13 Reasons Why (stylized onscreen as TH1RTEEN R3ASONS WHY) is an American teen drama web television series developed for Netflix by Brian Yorkey, based on the 2007 novel Thirteen Reasons Why by Jay Asher. The series revolves around seventeen year old high school student, Clay Jensen, and his deceased female friend Hannah Baker, who has committed suicide after failing to cope with the culture, gossip and lack of support from her friends and her school. A box of cassette tapes recorded by Hannah in the lead up to her suicide detail thirteen reasons why she ended her life. The series is produced by July Moon Productions, Kicked to the Curb Productions, Anonymous Content and Paramount Television, with Yorkey and Diana Son serving as showrunners. Dylan Minnette stars as Clay, while Katherine Langford plays Hannah.

A film from Universal Pictures based on Thirteen Reasons Why began development in February 2011, with Selena Gomez set to star as Hannah, before being shelved in favor of a television series and Netflix ordering the show straight to series in October 2015, with Gomez instead serving as an executive producer. The first season was released on Netflix on March 31, 2017. It received positive reviews from critics and audiences, who praised its subject matter and acting, particularly the performances of Minnette and Langford. For her performance, Langford received a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress in a Drama Series. However, its graphic depiction of issues such as suicide and rape, along with other mature content prompted concerns from mental health professionals. In response, Netflix added a warning card and from March 2018, a video that plays at the start of each season warning viewers about its themes.[2] In May 2017, Netflix renewed 13 Reasons Why for a second season; filming began the next month and concluded that December. The second season was released on May 18, 2018, and received negative reviews from critics and mixed reviews from audiences. A third season was ordered in June 2018 and is set to be released in 2019. Critical and audience reaction to the series has been divided, with the program generating controversy between audiences and industry reviewers. Premise [ edit ] In season one, seventeen year old Clay Jensen returns home from school one day to find a mysterious box on his porch. Inside he discovers seven cassette tapes recorded by Hannah Baker, his deceased classmate and unrequited love, who committed suicide two weeks earlier. On the tapes, Hannah unfolds an intensely emotional audio diary, detailing why she decided to end her life. It appears each person who receives this package of old-style tapes is fundamentally related to why she killed herself. Clay is not the first to receive the tapes, but there is implied detail as to how he should pass the tapes on after hearing them. There appears to be an order to distribution of the tapes, with an additional copy held by an overseer should the plan go awry. Each tape recording refers to a different person involved in Hannah's life contributing to a reason for her suicide. The tapes refer to both friends and enemies. In season two, months after Hannah's suicide, Clay and the other people mentioned on the tapes, as well as close friends and Hannah's family members, become embroiled in a civil legal battle between Hannah's parents and Liberty High School. Alleging negligence on the part of the school, Hannah's mother pursues her perception of justice, while her reluctance to settle pre-trial and her personal circumstances eventually break up her marriage with Hannah's father. The story unfolds with narratives illustrating Hannah's story told by those who present in court at trial.

The tapes describe the thirteen reasons why she took her own life, and each episode of the series follows Clay as he listens to a new tape and seeks out the relevant person to hear their side of the story. The series also explores the impact of bullying, depression, and suicide on those left behind.

13 Reasons Why has been praised for its acting, particularly that of Minnette and Langford, and for its portrayal of complex and realistic teenage characters. However, it has also been criticized for its graphic depictions of suicide and sexual assault, which some viewers have found triggering or disturbing.

Despite these concerns, the series has been a commercial success for Netflix, and has been renewed for a third season, which is set to premiere in 2019.

Actor Dylan Minnette, who plays the lead character Clay Jensen, has said that the show has been a ""game-changer"" for him, and has opened up new opportunities for him in the entertainment industry. He has also praised the show's message, saying that it is ""a story that needs to be told.""

Pregnant Kylie Jenner. Pregnant Kylie Jenner. Yet — Kylie Jenner, 20, has not actually confirmed she is pregnant.  For some celebrities, this would not be a big deal — some stars get pregnant and do not say a word, even as “sources” and “insiders” dish to the tabloids, as illustrated above. For someone in the Kardashian-Jenner family, this is especially confusing.  After all, these family members have become international superstars because they share nearly every detail of their lives, even the painful or uncomfortable moments. As a result, people have become inexplicably fascinated by all of them (Kris Jenner, Caitlyn Jenner, Kim Kardashian West, Kourtney Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian and Rob Kardashian), which has fueled their multimillion-dollar franchise of reality shows and sponsorships.  So the decision to keep Kylie’s apparent pregnancy under wraps is very off-brand for the family. This month, speculation will probably hit even more of a fever pitch, as February is the oft-reported due date for her baby, reportedly a girl.  The non-confirmation of the news — reported by the tabloids in September and described as a “happy” surprise for Kylie and her boyfriend, rapper Travis Scott — has sent some fans into a spiral.

Magazine is reporting that the ""Wildest Dreams"" singer has been contacting her ex ever since he has been in New York City starring in the Broadway show called Sunday in the Park With George.  The tabloid is reporting that a source is saying that Taylor is the one reaching out to the actor since she feels she is now more mature than she was when they dated back in 2010.  The source said, “Taylor was so young when they dated, she wasn’t ready for a serious relationship, but now she’s showing Jake how much she’s matured. She’s excited to see where things go.”  In 2015, a rumor swirled around saying that the stars were in contact with each other, even though she was dating Calvin Harris at the time.  An unidentified source told Star magazine that, “He said he owed Taylor an apology for how things ended between them. In June, Jake ran into Cara Delevingne at The Graham Norton Show and asked for Taylor’s new number. They’ve kept in touch, albeit secretly, ever since.""  This would all be so ironic since Taylor allegedly wrote the hit song ""We Are Never Getting Back Together"" from her Red album about the relationship after her ex's friend asked her if they were giving their relationship a second chance.  “This guy walks in who is a friend of my ex’s and starts talking about how he’s heard we’re going to get back together. And that was not the case. So I start telling them the story: break up, get back together, break-up, get back together — just, ugh, the worst! And I picked up the guitar and (songwriting partner Max Martin) said, ‘This is what we’re writing,’” she once revealed to GMA.  The lyrics in the track said: ""I'm really gonna miss you picking fights / And me falling for it screaming that I'm right / And you would hide away and find your peace of mind / With some indie record that's much cooler than mine.""  In the video for the song, the actor who plays the singer's love interest gives her a scarf which many thought to be a clue that revealed the song was about Jake since she had been photographed wearing one of his scarfs while they were dating.  Since Taylor is now single and so is Jake and they both happen to be living in the same city, we don't see how this could be a problem. There is no confirmation that this is actually happening though and a source close to them told Gossip Cop that there was ""no truth"" to the report.

Despite the denials, fans of the couple are hoping that they will get back together. Swift and Gyllenhaal dated for just under a year before splitting in 2011. Their breakup was said to be amicable, but Swift has never publicly spoken about it.

The news of Swift's supposed attempts to rekindle her relationship with Gyllenhaal has sparked a frenzy on social media, with fans speculating about whether the two will get back together. While some are rooting for the couple to rekindle their romance, others are skeptical about the rumors and are hoping that Swift will find happiness with someone else.

Barely a year after filing for divorce from her husband, Angelina is reportedly planning her fourth wedding to a wealthy, 40-something businessman and philanthropist, according to InTouch Weekly! Angelina and her handsome British guy reportedly started dating in early 2017, and has been keeping the whole relationship “very hush-hush.” That means that Brad has no idea she’s dating, let alone engaged or getting married. Uh oh!  “Angelina could tell Brad what’s going on but she’s choosing not to,” a source told InTouch. She reportedly hopes he “will be taken by complete surprise. If it makes Brad unhappy when he finds out, she’s fine with that.” She actually hasn’t even told her six kids about the alleged wedding for fear that they’ll spill the beans to their dad. Crafty!  As for the wedding itself, Angelina’s reportedly taking her closest friends and family to Cambodia, “her second home,” for a traditional Buddhist ceremony, according to the source. The wedding will allegedly take place on a wildlife reserve, wear traditional Cambodian clothing, and serve local delicacies at the reception. “Angie’s thinking of having Shiloh, Zahara, and Vivienne as bridesmaids and Maddox as the groom’s best man since Maddox sort of feels he’s the man of the family now,” the source said.

The lucky number four could play a significant role in Jolie's upcoming nuptials. It is believed that the actress, who has previously been married twice before, is considering tying the knot for the fourth time.

Jolie and her new partner are reportedly very serious about their relationship, and have been spotted on several romantic dates in recent months. However, the identity of the mystery man remains unknown, and speculation is rife as to who he might be.

Insiders close to the actress have suggested that Jolie is eager to start a new chapter in her life, and is looking forward to embracing the next phase of her personal and professional journey.

While details of the wedding are yet to be confirmed, it is thought that Jolie will be looking to keep things low-key and intimate, with a small group of close friends and family in attendance.

This would not be the first time that Jolie has surprised fans with her relationship choices. In the past, she has been romantically linked to a range of high-profile celebrities, including Billy Bob Thornton and Jonny Lee Miller.

Kim, I haven’t talked to in a year,” Jenner said while discusing her memoir at the U.K.’s Cambridge Union, according to Cambridge News.  Although Kardashian West publicly supported Jenner’s journey, she cut ties after reading her book, which alleged Kris Jenner — Caitlyn’s ex-wife and Kim’s mom — knew more about her gender identity crisis than she’s admitted.  In an episode of KUWTK, the KKW Beauty mogul also revealed that she had been hurt by a chapter in the memoir in which Jenner implied that her late father Robert Kardashian thought his friend O.J. Simpson was guilty of having killed wife Nicole Brown Simpson and waiter Ron Goldman — despite having served as the NFL star’s defense attorney in his 1994 murder trial.  “My relationship with Caitlyn was strained,” the mother of three said during the episode, which aired October of last year. “I was just trying to be respectful.

It was made known that Caitlyn Jenner and Rob Kardashian had opted to skip the chitchat and for obvious reasons, Blac Chyna and Tyga were not invited.

The decision comes as a surprise, given that Jenner was once a part of the Kardashian family and had appeared on their reality show, Keeping Up with the Kardashians.

Insiders say that the tension between Jenner and the Kardashian family has been escalating in recent months, and the recent controversy surrounding Megyn Kelly’s interview appears to have been the final straw. Jenner has reportedly been upset with the Kardashians for not being more supportive of her transition and for not using their platform to raise awareness about transgender issues.

Jenner’s decision not to watch the interview has been met with mixed reactions. While some have praised her for standing up for her beliefs, others have criticized her for not showing support for her own family. However, it seems that Jenner is unwilling to compromise her principles for the sake of appearances, and is determined to stay true to her convictions.

The interview is expected to be a highly-rated event, with millions of viewers tuning in to see the Kardashian and Jenner clan discuss a range of topics, including their personal lives, their business ventures, and their role in popular culture. Despite Jenner’s absence, the interview is likely to be a major media event, and will no doubt generate plenty of buzz and speculation in the weeks leading up to its airdate."

gossipcop-2388806885,1,0,"R. Kelly’s time may have finally come. R. Kelly has been accused of sexual relationships with minors going back to 1994, when he married 15-year-old pop star Aaliyah. (The marriage was annulled.) In the 24 years since then, he has been sued multiple times for inappropriate sexual contact with a minor (he settled out of court every time), and he was eventually charged with creating child pornography. (A jury found him not guilty on the grounds that they could not conclusively identify the other figure in his infamous sex tape as a child.) Last summer, he was accused of creating an abusive “sex cult” of very young women, whom he allegedly isolates, brainwashes, and abuses physically and emotionally. Since the story broke, multiple women have added their own testimonies of abuse at R. Kelly’s hands. (Through a lawyer, Kelly denied all accusations, saying he would “work diligently and forcibly to pursue his accusers and clear his name.”) And in April, another woman accused Kelly of “knowingly and intentionally infecting her with an STD.” Her lawyers say they are currently preparing a federal civil lawsuit. Through a spokesperson, Kelly issued a statement to the Washington Post in which he “categorically denies all claims and allegations.” As man after man has fallen to the #MeToo reckoning, losing jobs and retiring from public life after being accused of sexual harassment and assault, there’s been a recurring whisper: What about R. Kelly? Despite decades of lawsuits and allegations, Kelly’s career has marched steadily on. Last year, he finished an arena tour with a few cancellations. This year, he’s touring with singer Charlie Wilson (some protests are planned). His music appeared in Pitch Perfect 3. At this year’s Coachella, rapper Vince Staples repeatedly referred to Kelly as a “child molester” in an interview with Complex, insisting, “He pees on people.” In our post-#MeToo, post-Time’s Up, post-Harvey Weinstein world, and given the sheer volume of allegations against Kelly, it seems reasonable to raise the question of why he continues to work as much as he does. But Staples’s interviewer only giggled nervously and protested, “We can’t ever talk about this guy. ... You’re about to get me fired from Coachella. It’s my first time here.” Later, Staples tweeted that “R. Kelly people is looking for me.” ladies and gentlemen, vince staples on r kelly pic.twitter.com/SmZdYu9PNJ — andy (@aboynamedandy) April 16, 2018 That stasis may be starting to change. Most of the claims against Kelly were reiterated in a recent BBC Three documentary, R Kelly: Sex, Girls & Videotapes. And over the past year, at least five members of Kelly’s inner circle have left him. His assistant, his accountant, his lawyer, and his rep have all said that they no longer work for him, although none of them have gone into detail about their departures and all have been supportive and complimentary toward Kelly in their statements. His longtime musical accompanist, DJ Phantom, was less circumspect about his decision to leave Kelly in December: “I didn’t know then what I know now,” he said. “He’s a shitbag.” In April, the Women of Color committee within Time’s Up threw its weight behind the #MuteRKelly campaign, calling for anyone currently profiting from Kelly and his music to drop him, including Spotify, Ticketmaster, and Kelly’s record label, RCA. Shortly thereafter, Spotify announced that it would no longer be promoting Kelly’s music, although his music would remain in their streaming catalog. It’s possible that these new developlments mean things are changing for Kelly, and that he’s about to face lasting consequences for those accusations. But if that’s the case, those consequences took more than two decades to reach him. There is a persistent vagueness to the way we talk about R. Kelly that makes it possible to forget exactly what he’s been accused of, how often he’s been accused, and how much proof there is against him. And most likely, that’s because his alleg","R. Kelly, the R&B singer, songwriter, and record producer, has been at the center of numerous sexual misconduct allegations over the years. However, despite numerous accusations and investigations, Kelly has managed to evade legal consequences. But recent developments suggest that his time may have finally come.

Earlier this week, a grand jury in Chicago indicted Kelly on 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse, involving four victims, including three underage girls. The charges relate to alleged incidents that took place between 1999 and 2010. If convicted, Kelly could face a maximum sentence of 70 years in prison.

The indictment comes after a lengthy investigation by federal and local law enforcement agencies, who have been gathering evidence against Kelly for years. It is also the latest in a series of legal setbacks for the singer, who was arrested in February on charges of child pornography and sex trafficking.

The allegations against Kelly date back to 1994, when he married 15-year-old pop star Aaliyah. Since then, numerous women have come forward with allegations of sexual misconduct, including sexual coercion, physical abuse, and cult-like control. Despite these allegations, Kelly has maintained his innocence and has never been convicted of a crime.

The new indictment is seen as a significant development in the case against Kelly. It is likely to be closely watched by legal experts and advocates for victims of sexual abuse, who hope that it will bring some measure of justice for Kelly's alleged victims.

In a statement, Kelly's attorney, Steve Greenberg, denied the allegations and vowed to mount a vigorous defense. ""R. Kelly has been the target of a greater conspiracy to demean him and his music,"" Greenberg said. ""We look forward to the truth coming out in court.""

The case against Kelly is likely to be closely watched by the public, as well as by the music industry and lawmakers. It raises important questions about the responsibility of artists and celebrities, as well as the legal system, in addressing allegations of sexual misconduct.

R. Kelly's case is a reminder that the #MeToo movement is not just about Hollywood and the entertainment industry, but also about the need for accountability and justice for victims of sexual abuse in all walks of life."

Here’s how the Biebs is coping with his time apart from Sel.  Justin Bieber, 24, is going through a tough time as his relationship with Selena Gomez, 25, is on pause. She’s currently on vacation with friends in Sydney, Australia, where she appears to be carefree in this new video. However, a source reveals that the same can’t be said for Bieber. “Justin has Selena on the brain constantly. He is trying to drown it out by hanging with friends and doing stuff on his own time but he keeps thinking about her,” a source EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com. “He always wants to be around her, talk to her and be with her. She is like a drug for him, he just needs more and more and more.”  As the Biebs continues to struggle with their time apart, he’s got a few things up his sleeve for when she returns to LA. “He can’t wait until she is back because he wants to really wine and dine her upon her return and really kick start the relationship back up again,” the insider reveals. It’s unclear when Sel is scheduled to return to the West Coast. But, as seen on her Instagram, she is having the time of her life. She posted a video which showed her laughing on a boat, accompanied by a subliminal message, that she “chose” to take care of herself, “not to prove anything to anyone.” Was she trying to give us insight into her most recent split with Bieber?  Jelena fans went into panic mode after seeing Sel in the arms of another man on a boat on March 19. She was photographed hugging and goofing off in photos with Sydney native, Johnny Rays. While all signs point to a friendship between the two, the photos didn’t appear that way to some fans who claimed they looked too close for comfort.  While Sel has been vacationing Down Under, Bieber has been staying active. He’s been photographed playing hockey and soccer with friends. However, his emotions may be getting the best of him as he took a gnarly fall during a soccer game on March 19, and seemingly broke down on the sidelines of a hockey game on March 17.  As you may recall, Jelena reunited in October 2017, after her split with The Weeknd, 28. They seemed inseparable, having spent New Year’s together in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. However, their romance took a rocky turn around Bieber’s birthday on March 1, according to reports.","Justin Bieber has reportedly been struggling to come to terms with his recent split from Selena Gomez, according to a source close to the situation. The insider, who spoke to HollywoodLife.com exclusively, revealed that the singer is finding it difficult to see his former partner moving on so quickly, as Gomez has been spotted all smiles on her Australian vacation.

The source went on to say that Bieber is finding it hard to move on from the relationship, and is struggling to understand why Gomez has seemingly moved on so easily. The insider added that Bieber is trying to stay positive and focus on his music, but is still deeply affected by the split.

Gomez and Bieber's relationship has been a source of interest for the media for several years, and fans were shocked when the couple announced their decision to end their relationship last month. Since then, Gomez has been spotted on a number of occasions looking happy and relaxed while on vacation in Australia, which has reportedly been a source of frustration for Bieber.

Despite the challenges he is currently facing, Bieber's fans are said to be standing by him and offering their support during this difficult time. The singer is expected to continue working on his music, and will likely use his experiences as inspiration for his upcoming projects."

The insider tells OK! “Rob was basically a 24-hour pot smoker back in his Twilight days, but since his relationship with Twigs got serious he's scaled back on all his vices and hardly ever drinks or smokes around other people.”  If Robert drank due to being stressed with the fame of Twilight, we can only imagine what happened after those infamous photos of Kristen Stewart making out with her movie producer boss while they were still together did to him.  ""He's matured a lot and become this very serious young man,” adds the source. “Rob’s dismayed that Charlie [Hunnam] hasn’t given up his pot habit. He doesn’t want to hang out with him, or his other hard-partying friends like Tom Sturridge or Eddie Redmayne.”  But we haven’t heard anything negative about FKA Twigs since they started dating in 2014, so it sounds like having a low-profile and more mature partner is exactly what he needed to turn his life around!","I don’t know what the fuck I’m saying.”

A spokesperson for the recording studio where the interview took place confirmed that the artist had been under the influence of a controlled substance during the interview. The spokesperson declined to comment further on the matter, citing privacy concerns.

The artist in question, whose real name is John Smith, has a history of substance abuse. In the past, he has spoken openly about his struggles with addiction, but has also been known to make jokes about his substance use in public appearances.

Despite his history of substance abuse, Smith has remained a popular and successful artist. His most recent album, which was released last year, was a critical and commercial success. However, his recent behavior has raised concerns among fans and industry insiders alike.

Smith’s management team has not yet commented on the matter, but it is expected that they will address the issue in the coming days. In the meantime, fans are left to wonder what the future holds for the talented but troubled artist."

gossipcop-6225895099,1,0,"Chris Soules, former star of ABC’s “The Bachelor,” after his arrest. (Buchanan County Sheriff via AP) Iowa farmer Chris Soules, a former star on ABC’s “The Bachelor” who charmed reality TV viewers with his small-town life, was arrested this week after police said he fled a crash that killed a fellow farmer. Soules, 35, was charged with leaving the scene of a fatal crash, a class D felony, and could face up to five years in prison if he is convicted. The case has garnered the attention of Soules’s “Bachelor” fans as well as residents of Arlington, Iowa, where he lives, who had come to appreciate the reality TV star’s work as an unofficial Iowa ambassador and farm industry advocate. “This story is going to spread like wildfire around here and probably all over because of who he is,” Mary Jo Brown, Arlington’s city clerk, told the Des Moines Register. “Sometimes fame isn’t your friend.” Soules, who also appeared in “Dancing with the Stars” and “Worst Chefs in America,” called 911 at 8:20 p.m. Monday evening to report that he had rear-ended a tractor on a rural road north of the tiny town of Aurora, about six miles away from his home. The tractor veered into a ditch after being struck by his 2008 Chevrolet Silverado, Soules said. The tractor driver — later identified as 66-year-old Kenneth Mosher, a Vietnam War veteran — was unconscious and not breathing, Soules told the 911 operator, according to audio obtained by local media. The man had a pulse, but there was blood around his mouth, Soules said. Soules identified himself on the call, which lasted nearly six minutes, and sounded frantic. Between heavy breathing, he answered the dispatcher’s questions and took instructions. Soules told the 911 operator he did not know how to perform CPR and could be heard asking unidentified people at the scene if they could perform the lifesaving measure. The call ended abruptly after the operator told Soules law enforcement and medical first responders were on the way. “Can I, can I call you back really quick?” Soules asked the dispatcher. “Yeah, you can call me back,” she says. “Thank you,” Soules responds. Soules left the crash site after emergency responders arrived, but before deputies with the Buchanan County Sheriff’s Office were on the scene, according to authorities. Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Scott Bright told the Des Moines Register that Soules fled the scene on foot and later got into a truck. In police audio obtained by local media, a deputy told a dispatcher that Soules “took off” in a red truck. Authorities are trying to identify who picked up Soules in the truck, Buchanan County Sheriff Bill Wolfgram told the Associated Press. That person could face charges, he said. Alcohol was found at the scene and investigators are trying to determine whose it was and whether it or speed were factors in the crash. Soules was arrested about five hours after the incident and booked into the Buchanan County Jail, the Associated Press reported. He posted a $10,000 bond Tuesday morning and was released on the condition that he surrender his passport and wear an electronic monitor. During his first appearance in court, the Buchanan County assistant attorney told the judge that Soules refused to cooperate with law enforcement after they located him at his home.

I picked difficult situations the first two times, but I think you learn with each one. I’m a person that believes that if I’m wrong, that’s when I learn, and when I’m right, I haven’t learned a thing.”  Noting that he takes his relationship “day to day,” Brolin revealed that he’s an advocate of marriage counseling.  “I do believe in counseling if anybody ever has a problem in their marriage. Bring in a referee, talk it over, and I swear to you, it will dispel by the end of the session, each time!” he said. “Sometimes in a tough marriage, it’s tough to talk, but if you do, it works!”  The 77-year-old actor has also learned to maintain his marriage with Streisand by not interrupting her during hectic times.  “When she’s busy, she’s really focused, and part of our good relationship is that I understand that,” he shared. “And if I come to her with something important and she says, ‘I don’t have time right now,’ she doesn’t have time, period. That’s the way the mind works. You gotta focus.”  As for how Streisand, 75, makes him feel special, Brolin said, “I’m always welcome when I get home. I always get notes, ‘Hurry home!’ When I get there, there’s always something kind of great waiting for me, some plan, and I try to reciprocate.”  RELATED CONTENT:  Barbra Streisand Calls Out Golden Globes for Not Awarding More Female Directors  ‘Girls Trip' Star Tiffany Haddish Says She Taught Barbra Streisand All About Cardi B  Josh Brolin on His Ripped Bod and How He Knew Wife Kathyrn Boyd Was the One (Exclusive)  Related Gallery","Title: James Brolin and Barbra Streisand Celebrate Two Decades of Love

Heidi, 44, looks like a fountain of youth but it obviously takes more of an effort than we knew. But her loved one are over her ramming her perfection down their throats.  Adds the insider, “What also really annoys people is how Heidi fakes being normal. She even pretends to eat junk food when the cameras are on her but she hasn’t actually swallowed a bite of a burger in years.”  Just last month, she and her boyfriend spent time in Italy, so we really have no idea how she avoided the pasta and pizza!  “All she talks about is working out and what she’s eaten that day – which is usually not much more than a handful of nuts and steamed kale.” That doesn’t sound like fun.","OK! has learned exclusively from a source that Heidi Klum, the famous model and television personality, has become increasingly obsessed with her workout routine and diet to the point where it has become a major topic of conversation in her personal and professional life. According to the source, Klum's constant chatter about her fitness regimen and her strict avoidance of carbohydrates has become tedious for everyone around her, including her boyfriend, Vito Schnabel, and is a major reason why he needs to take breaks from their relationship so often.

The source continued, ""Heidi's obsession with her physical appearance has always been a part of her persona, but it has reached a new level of extreme recently. She is constantly talking about her workouts and how she is avoiding carbs, and it's just not interesting to anyone else. Even her close friends and family members are getting tired of hearing about it.""

The insider added, ""Vito has been trying to deal with Heidi's behavior, but it's becoming increasingly difficult for him. He needs time to himself to avoid getting sucked into her obsession with fitness. Heidi's friends and family are worried that she is becoming too consumed with her image and it's starting to affect her mental health.""

It's unclear whether Klum's extreme focus on her physical appearance is having a negative impact on her personal and professional life, but it is clear that those closest to her are becoming increasingly concerned. The source concluded, ""Heidi needs to take a step back and focus on other aspects of her life, or risk alienating those closest to her."""

Up till tpo that moment Crazy Jo-lie had kept Brad far from Jen. Make no mistake about it. Her frantic traveling all over the place was an attempt at keeping Pitt away from her and and any other person who might think they were a friend. She can't stand anyone but her having anything to do with Pitt . Including his own family. I knew it would backfire one day. Brad what took so long????? She suffers from an extreme mental illness. She doesn't have the kids in school for the same reason.  I do believe she thought it would last. Seeing how sexy and pretty she thinks she is. A man should and would do anything she tells them to.  I am under the impression her treatment of her surrogate Holly had a sort of wake up call to Pitt as to how utterly evil she is. You can bet she dismissed her like a piece of shite. A woman who carried twins for her. Started making Brad see her game of using and abusing.  And when Jen said her and Brad talk all the time on the phone you know that was news to little miss do as I say not as I do Angelina still talks to her ex's Jo-LIE.    Guess all the years of trying to force Brad to believe Jen was a shallow no good woman has a way of catching up to one. It took this long for Pitt to see just what had truly happened. Her spells have lost the power to confuse.In Touch said she has a terrible jealous streak and can't stand Brad even looking at a woman SHE DEEMS ATTRACTIVE IN ANY WAY. WE ALL KNOW HOW MUCH FUN THAT CAN BE.    The National Enquirer  Says Brad is so happy to have a separation from her.Brad's closest friends are woman and that drives Angelina nuts she hates sharing him  He was mad she took the salt role because she had promised him she would stay at home and be a mom.  I mean you can see her doing whatever she damn well wanted to. And he went along with it. But they have twin babies and my guess is she spends very little time bonding with them. What woman would not want to be able to stay with her new little babies. Not this woman. Sick behavior for sure. And the only thing keeping Brad from making it final is the kids.  Angie be careful what you wish for. Seems like 6 kids are going to be without a mom and dad in one place. Good luck with that","News Flash: Actress Jen's Downward Spiral Following Oscar Night

There comes a time in every couple's relationship when the question of moving in together becomes impossible to ignore. And when those two lovebirds have been stepping out for 15 months — even though they live 3,500 miles apart; he in the UK, she in Canada — it's not so much a case of 'if' as of 'when' they will settle down. So it comes as no surprise that Prince Harry, 33, and his actress girlfriend Meghan Markle, 36, are said to be house-hunting. £7.25million - North Aston Manor, Oxfordshire: This eight bedroom property, overlooking the stunning Cherwell Valley, has seven reception rooms, a spa, swimming pool and 18.2 acres with equestrian facilities. It's nine miles from Soho Farmhouse and swanky shopping centre Bicester Village, should Meghan fancy snapping up some designer bargains Prince Harry and actress girlfriend Meghan Markle were pictured together at the Invictus Games in Toronto last month Royal sources have exclusively told the Daily Mail that the royal couple are looking in Oxfordshire and are particularly interested in high-end properties tucked away in the rolling Cotswold hills. A good friend of Harry's says the Prince, whose father's residence, Highgrove House, is in the south Cotswolds, has a long-standing affection for the area, while Meghan is said to be entranced by its rustic charm. 'He is searching for a new home in the area,' the friend reveals. 'Before Meghan, he was vaguely looking in Norfolk, but didn't find what he wanted. Now, with her input, he's renewed his search.' £2million - The Old Rectory, Lower Brailes, Oxfordshire: A stunning wood-panelled property dating from the 14th century, this boasts eight bedrooms, a sun-drenched terrace and its own private lake, complete with duck house. There’s a three-bedroom coach house for guests and it’s set at the end of a no-through road. Certainly, the lush green countryside encompassing swathes of Warwickshire, Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire is a huge draw for London-dwellers eager to snap up rural boltholes. Just an hour or so from the capital, it's home (or at least a weekend retreat) to A-listers, politicians and media executives: the Camerons, Beckhams, Kate Moss, Lily Allen and Stella McCartney all have million-pound properties in the area. 'It's like a magnet,' says Sophie Gannon, of Savills Estate Agents in Banbury, Oxfordshire. 'If you get one person, you get them all.' However, Harry isn't following the crowd but listening to his heart. The Cotswolds, and specifically Highgrove, which was bought by his father's private estate in 1980, is where the Prince spent much of his childhood. It was Charles and Diana's weekend home, with 15-acre grounds and, later on, a teenage haven in the cellars of the main house, which Harry nicknamed 'Club H'. £2.95million - Fanthill, Banbury, Oxfordshire: Accessed through electric gates, up a winding driveway, this eight-bedroom house sits among 20 acres of land, so ticks all Harry’s boxes when it comes to privacy. There’s a heated outdoor pool, miniature golf course and a carp lake, where the young lovebirds could row off the private pier A local who knows the family says: 'It's not surprising that Harry would like to live where he feels at home. 'He's lived in the Cotswolds all his life and often returns to visit his father. After his mother died, it became a place of sanctuary. 'When the boys entered their teens, Charles bought several homes in the area, thinking they might want one in the future.' Ten years ago, Charles bought up properties adjacent to his sprawling estate, paying £2 million apiece for nearby manor houses and farm buildings. But sources say rather than living off his father's generosity, Harry wants to invest in a place of his own. £4.25million - Cross Hill House, Adderbury, Oxfordshire: This 10-bedroom house, surrounded by landscaped","News:

It’s no secret that Jennifer Lopez-at 48-has a body that won’t quit and skin that needs to be studied so we can all age like the goddess she is.  Dramatic? Not even close.  And while a lot of it may be down to great genes, Lopez has revealed in a new interview some of her beauty secrets and yep, they’re as diva as you might expect.  Lopez credits her glow to positive affirmations, revealing she says one in particular to herself every day to keep her radiant, youthful look intact.  So what is this magic phrase?  “I am youthful and timeless at every age,” Lopez says every single day—but it’s not enough to just say the mantra daily, because Lopez also has a handful of pillows with these words and more mantras embroidered into them all over her home. “I tell myself that every day, a few times a day. It sounds like clichéd bullshit, but it’s not: Age is all in your mind. Look at Jane Fonda.”  Lopez continues, “The affirmations are everywhere. I forget that they’re all here. They’re just part of the house now.”  Before you scoff at Lopez’s positivity there is a school of thought that believes negative thoughts can age you. Australian-born Dr Blackburn, a Nobel Prize winner, co-authored The Telomere Effect: A Revolutionary Approach to Living Younger, Healthier, Longer, with anti-aging psychologist Dr Elissa Epel, which investigated the link between telomeres, which protect our chromosomes, and the effect stress, sleep and diet can have on telomeres and how that directly corresponds with our health.  The book asserts there is a correlation between depression and anxiety and shorter telomeres and that “when pessimists develop an aging-related illness, like cancer or heart disease, the illness tends to progress faster.”  And really there's only so far a little highlight can go, step one is all about a positive attitude. Step two is to find yourself a great pillowcase and settle on your new mantra.  So what’s the lesson here? Your inner glow is only a glass half full attitude away.","Jenny, the famous American singer and actress, has been credited for her youthful appearance, and one of the secrets behind her glowing skin is her use of silk pillowcases.

Each time Channing and Jenna head to mediation to discuss the terms of their divorce, “they can’t seem to agree on anything,” says a source. “Their meetings have been contentious.” One big issue: their five-year-old daughter, Everly. “They can’t agree on custody,” a friend tells In Touch exclusively.      Unicorns do exist. A post shared by Channing Tatum (@channingtatum) on May 4, 2018 at 6:40pm PDT      “They’re both working hard to do what’s in the best interest of their daughter, but it’s just taking way longer than they both expected because they can’t agree on the small details.” Another sticking point: Channing’s estimated $60 million fortune. Though Jenna, 37, has had a successful movie and TV career with shows like Supergirl, Channing, 38, has starred in several blockbusters, such as Magic Mike and 21 Jump Street, and was the family’s main breadwinner. “Jenna has told friends that she gave Channing the best years of her life,” says the source, “and now she’s trying to negotiate a very secure future for herself.”  There is a lot at stake financially. During the course of their marriage, the pair acquired several assets, including a $6 million Beverly Hills home and pricey cars including a Tesla and a vintage Chevrolet truck. Finding common ground about dividing their stuff “is not easy,” says the friend. “They both want it to be over with.”          Jenna never thought it would come to this. “She isn’t pleased about how it’s all played out so far,” says the source. “She’s bitter. There are days when she’s blaming him for not working harder to save their marriage.” And while she’s told pals that she hopes they can stay friends, adds the source, deep down “she knows that’s never going to happen.”  Channing shouldn’t underestimate Jenna, says the source: “She’s looking out for herself, and at the end of the day she knows that he’s got to pay.

A year after the split, Rose appeared on The Wendy Williams Show, noting, “[Kanye] said that he was an a-hole and he was mean to me and he didn’t treat me the way he was supposed to.

According to a source close to the couple, the former One Direction member is spending nights away from home while Cheryl is left to care for their baby son alone. The friend revealed that Cheryl has been doing her best to cope with the situation, but the distance is taking a toll on both her and their child.

The insider also revealed that Liam's busy schedule, which includes touring and promoting his music, has been a significant factor in the strain on their relationship. Cheryl, who has been focusing on her own career and personal life, has been trying to support her partner but the distance is proving to be too much.

This latest development in their relationship comes just months after they announced their split. The couple, who have been together for over two years, announced their separation in July, but have remained close for the sake of their son. However, it seems that the distance between them is proving to be too much and their relationship is struggling to survive."
gossipcop-9639077061,1,1,"Ivanka Trump is becoming one of the most powerful first children in American History – despite not having an official job in the Trump administration. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) Ivanka Trump’s products weren’t always the hottest items online. In January, for instance, the first daughter’s fashion line ranked No. 550 based on the number of orders from Lyst, the biggest fashion e-commerce website in the world, according to Forbes. That changed dramatically the following month. Sales of Trump’s products skyrocketed in early February, making her Lyst’s 11th most popular brand. The biggest spike, according to Lyst, came on Feb. 9, when sales jumped by 219 percent from the day before. Yes, Feb. 9 — the same day that White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted Trump’s clothing and jewelry line on “Fox & Friends.” “Go buy Ivanka’s stuff is what I would tell you,” Conway said. “I’m going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody.” And viewers did, apparently. Sales of Ivanka Trump’s branded products skyrocketed on Feb. 9, the same day White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted the line on Fox News. (Lyst) Abigail Klem, president of the Ivanka Trump brand, said in a statement that “the beginning of February” shows “the best performing weeks in the history of the brand.” “For several different retailers, Ivanka Trump was a top performer online, and in some of the categories it was the best performance ever,” Klem said. Sarah Tanner, Lyst’s spokeswoman, said increases in sales are usually tied to current events. For instance, interest in pantsuits went up by 460 percent last year because of Hillary Clinton’s affinity for the style, she said. Sales of the first daughter’s products went up by 86 percent in November when her father won the presidential election, according to the company. Conway has come under fire for touting Ivanka Trump's clothing line during a televised interview. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) [A Trump wine boycott backfires spectacularly] But the brand was “largely featured” in the news in February, Tanner said. Conway gave her on-air endorsement of Ivanka Trump’s brand after President Trump had complained on Twitter that his daughter had “been treated so unfairly” by the department store Nordstrom, which dropped her clothing line over slow sales. “It would not be a surprise to us if it resulted in the increase in sales,” Tanner said of Conway’s Fox interview. “I think that’s one of the reasons the brand was largely in the news and could have attributed to this increase.” Conway did not respond to an email requesting comment. Her promotion of the fashion line appeared to violate an ethics rule barring federal employees from using their public office to endorse products and immediately drew criticism from both Democrats and Republicans. [Where does the Ivanka Trump brand go from here?] Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said Conway’s comments were “absolutely wrong, wrong, wrong” and “clearly over the line,” The Washington Post reported. The White House later said that Conway had been “counseled.” But concerns about her comments remain. On Thursday, the government’s top ethics official criticized the White House for not disciplining Conway, The Post’s Drew Harwell reported. Walter M. Shaub Jr., director of the Office of Government Ethics, had urged officials last month to reprimand the White House counsel but was rebuffed. On Thursday he wrote to Stefan C. Passantino, who handles White House ethics issues as the president’s deputy counsel. “When an employee’s conduct violates, disciplinary action serves to deter future misconduct,” Shaub wrote. “Not taking disciplinary action against a senior official under such circumstances risks undermining the ethics program.” [A Trump voter’s message to retailers: ‘Keep your mouths shut about our president’] Last month, a group of law professors filed a professional misconduct complaint against Conway — a",

In a shocking move that has left the international community reeling, President Donald Trump announced on Thursday that he plans to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord. Hollywood responded swiftly, with many celebrities taking to social media to voice their outrage and disappointment over the decision.

""This is a devastating blow to the future of our planet,"" tweeted Leonardo DiCaprio, a passionate environmental activist. ""The United States has long been a leader in the fight against climate change, but this decision sends a dangerous message to the rest of the world.""

Meanwhile, Meryl Streep, another outspoken advocate for environmental protection, released a statement condemning the president's decision. ""The Paris agreement was a vital step forward in the global effort to combat climate change,"" she said. ""By pulling out of the accord, the U.S. is abandoning its responsibility to protect future generations.""

The entertainment industry is not the only sector to react to the news. Business leaders, politicians, and environmental organizations have also spoken out against the decision, with many vowing to continue working towards a sustainable future without the support of the United States.

The Paris climate accord, signed by 195 countries in 2015, aimed to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The U.S. was one of the earliest signatories to the agreement, but Trump has long been critical of the deal, calling it ""bad for American business"" and ""unfair"" to the United States.

The president's decision has sparked widespread concern and condemnation both domestically and internationally, with many questioning the U.S.'s commitment to tackling one of the most pressing issues of our time. As the world looks to leaders for guidance and direction, the implications of this decision will be felt for years to come."

The Australian actor, who has been engaged to the American singer-songwriter since 2012, has reportedly become increasingly frustrated with their on-again, off-again relationship, which has been marked by frequent breakups and reconciliations.

A source close to the couple has revealed that Hemsworth, who has been struggling to cope with the pressure of their relationship, has become increasingly distant from Cyrus in recent months. The insider added that the couple’s recent appearance at the Golden Globes, where they were spotted avoiding each other and sitting at separate tables, was a clear indication that their relationship was on the rocks.

Furthermore, Cyrus’s recent statement that she does not envision getting married anytime soon has also added to the strain on their relationship. Despite the fact that Hemsworth has been eager to tie the knot, Cyrus has reportedly made it clear that she is not ready to settle down and is focusing on her career.

In light of these developments, it appears that the power couple are about to call off their engagement for a second time, ending their three-year relationship. While the news is sure to come as a shock to their fans, it is clear that the couple have been struggling for some time, and a split may be the best outcome for both parties."

While public debate rages about Donald Trump’s health, Melania has told friends and associates that the once robust and high energy man she knew and loved has been replaced with a “slower, damaged version”.  “By 8pm he is slurring,” she said. “This is not the man I know.”  Fearing that the sedatives are being pumped into the body of the POTUS via Coca-Cola that he orders by pressing a button he had installed on the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, Melania has insisted he stop drinking from the tap and instead revert to drinking from cans she brings herself.  “Donald’s heath improved out of sight when he stopped drinking from the tap,” Melania said.  However the First Lady fears the active campaign to poison the president is “a high level operation” and “not the work of a solitary loon.”  Melania is popular in the White House—as she is with the rest of the country—and she has befriended senior intelligence agency staff who remain loyal to president. They have educated her about Ronald Regan’s poisoning by the Deep State after his assassination attempt in 1981. They have also warned her that George W. Bush was reduced to a “brain damaged” state after years of steady poisoning.  But the advantage Trump may hold over his GOP predecessors in the Oval Office is that he has a wife who is wise to the ruse and is insisting he watch his food and drink intake closely for signs of adulteration.  Donald Trump’s food choices say a lot about the man. The president’s Howard Hughes-level pickiness when it comes to food is partly motivated by a desire to avoid being poisoned, according to Melania. He doesn’t trust those around him – and rightfully so.  As President Trump knows all too well, there are enemies of the state dug in deep at the White House.  Reporters from TIME recently got a glimpse behind-the-scenes at the White House, where they reported on what goes down at the president’s dinner table. Of particular interest was a meal enjoyed by the reporters, Trump, and Vice President Pence.  Pence’s meal was not unusual—he ate what everyone else did. But the POTUS received a meal fully customized to his own preferences, and closely observed by Melania who insisted on watching the chef prepare the meal with ingredients she provided herself.","Melania Trump, the First Lady of the United States, has made a shocking claim that there is a secret poisoner residing within the White House. Mrs. Trump expressed her fears that her husband, President Donald Trump, is being slowly poisoned with ""heavy sedatives"" that have been smuggled into his drinks, all in an attempt to control him and discredit his presidency.

The allegations were first reported by a European tabloid, which claimed to have received information from an anonymous source close to the First Lady. The source reportedly told the tabloid that Mrs. Trump has become increasingly concerned about her husband's health and well-being, and that she believes he is being targeted by an unknown assailant.

According to the source, Mrs. Trump has been working with a team of private investigators and security experts to uncover the identity of the poisoner. She is reportedly examining the staff at the White House, as well as outside contractors and visitors, in an attempt to identify the person responsible for the alleged poisoning.

The news of the First Lady's claims has sent shockwaves through the political world, with many calling for an immediate investigation into the matter. Some have even suggested that the situation could have serious implications for the stability and security of the United States.

In response to the allegations, the White House has issued a statement denying the claims and calling them ""absurd and baseless."" However, the statement did not address the specific allegations of poisoning, leaving many to wonder if there is any truth to the claims.

As the situation continues to unfold, it remains to be seen how it will impact the Trump presidency and the future of the United States. For now, all eyes are on the First Lady and her ongoing investigation into the alleged poisoning of her husband."

Born Kate Garry Hudson on April 19, 1979, in Los Angeles, California, US, she came to prominence in 2001 with her incredible turn in Almost Famous. This role not only made her famous, but it also fetched her a Golden Globe and several nominations, including a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Being a daughter of American actress Goldie Hawn, Hudson bears more than a passing resemblance to her famous mother in both looks and onscreen vivacity. She got the chance to showcase her talent in 1996, when she made her TV debut on Fox's TV series Party of Five (1994-2000). Although she only appeared in one episode titled ""Spring Breaks: Part 1"", this initial experience was enough to uphold her determination to develop a professional acting career in Hollywood. However, it was in 1999 that she started to attract public attention when critics lauded her brilliant portrayal of Cindy in ""200 Cigarettes"", even though the movie itself was a commercial disappointment. Onwards, her career experienced a significant advancement, especially after she managed to obtain a supporting role in ""Gossip"" and ""Dr T and the Women"" which both came up in 2000. While her accolade-worthy performance in Cameron Crowe's Almost Famous indicated that she was set to follow her mother in taking the film industry by storm. In the midst of a whirlwind schedule of fashion shoots and awards shows, she made an appearance in the romantic war drama The Four Feathers in 2002. Turning out to be a box-office failure, Hudson fired back with the surefire hit as she starred opposite quirky heartthrob Matthew McConaughey in the romantic comedy How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003). She continued to establish herself as a fully-fledged actress starring in subsequent productions like Raising Helen (2004), The Skeleton Key (2005), You, Me and Dupree (2006), Fool's Gold (2008) and Bride Wars (2009). As of most recent, she could be seen in the musical comedy-drama television series Glee as Cassandra July.","Her career took off and she has since appeared in numerous films, including How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, The Skeleton Key, and Bride Wars.

Matt was a kind and generous colleague who treated me with respect. In fact, a joke I once made on late-night television was just that, because it was completely contrary to our brother-sister relationship. It’s still very upsetting. I really admire the way Savannah [Guthrie] and Hoda [Kotb] and the entire Today show staff have handled a very difficult situation.”  The late-night show joke that Couric refers to is when she said on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen in 2012 that Lauer “pinches me on the ass a lot.” A clip of the comment made the rounds online in the wake of Lauer’s firing.  Couric spent 15 years co-hosting NBC’s Today show with Lauer, 60, but left in May 2006 to anchor the CBS Evening News.  NBC/Getty  Lauer was fired at the end of November by NBC News after the network received a “detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior,” with reason to believe “this may not have been an isolated incident.” Women have also anonymously accused him of sexual harassment and assault in reports published by Variety and The New York Times.  Following his firing, which was announced live on Today by Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb, Lauer addressed the original allegations in a statement.  “There are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions,” he said, in part. “To the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry. As I am writing this, I realize the depth of the damage and disappointment I have left behind at home and at NBC.”  Although her PEOPLE interview is the first time Couric has spoken in detail about Lauer’s exit, she briefly broke her silence about the scandal on social media in December.  In a short response to an Instagram user, who called Couric out for not publicly addressing the scandal, the veteran journalist said, “It’s incredibly upsetting and I will say something when I’m ready to. Thanks for your interest.”  RELATED VIDEO: Women of Hollywood Attend Golden Globes Together in Support of the Time’s Up Movement  The claims against Lauer came as hundreds of women and men — including Rose McGowan, Ashley Judd, Terry Crews and Anthony Rapp — have publicly came forward about alleged sexual misconduct at the hands of powerful men in Hollywood, including Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey.  The movement inspired the new Time’s Up initiative and legal defense fund that was created to help victims of sexual misconduct pursue legal action against their perpetrators. Time’s Up was a major focus at this year’s Golden Globes, where almost all the famous attendees wore black to raise awareness about the cause.  “I think it was really moving to see so many women support each other and demand change, not only for themselves, but for mistreated and marginalized women in all kinds of industries,” Couric tells PEOPLE about Time’s Up. “Clearly we are witnessing a sea change and a long overdue course correction.”  She also said that one of the new of the episodes of her upcoming six-part documentary Nat Geo series will focus on harassment women have experienced in their workplaces.  “One of my Nat Geo episodes explores the various obstacles that are holding women back in Hollywood, Silicon Valley and beyond,” she says. “I just interviewed Elisabeth Moss about this.

But the male player ranked 701 in the world - Dmitry Tursunov - believes he could beat her.  Speaking to US radio station NPR, seven-time Grand Slam champion McEnroe said of former world number one Williams, who has won an Open-era record 23 Grand Slams: ""If she played the men's circuit she'd be, like, 700 in the world.""  He qualified the comments by saying: ""That doesn't mean I don't think Serena is an incredible player, and I suppose anything's possible; maybe at some point a women's tennis player can be better than anybody.""  But he added: ""I just haven't seen that in any other sport, and I haven't seen it in tennis. If she had to just play the men's circuit, it would be an entirely different story.""  Williams later responded on Twitter: ""Dear John, I adore and respect you but please please keep me out of your statements that are not factually based.  ""I've never played anyone ranked ""there"" nor do I have time. Respect me and my privacy as I'm trying to have a baby. Good day sir.""  Williams, 35, won her 23rd Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in January. It later transpired she was pregnant at the time  'She is pregnant, and I'm not'  Tursunov, 34, was once ranked as high as 20th in the world.  The Russian told BBC World Service Sport he did not think McEnroe was ""trying to talk women's tennis down"" but said ""the reality"" was that ""men are stronger in general"".  ""I would hope that I would win against Serena,"" he added.  ""It would be a similar argument to: who would run faster, the fastest woman or the fastest man? Tennis is becoming more and more a physical sport, so it's going to be hard for a woman to beat the men.  ""It's not black and white, there are lots of factors to take into account. Physically I might not be in the best shape of my life but as an overall package I'm much better than my ranking would suggest. She is pregnant, and I'm not.  ""I've never heard John say anything absolutely stupid - he knows his stuff. What he said about her being an incredible player is correct - explosive, powerful and she puts in a lot of work. But I would hope that I would win.""  Battle of the sexes  A crowd of 30,000 watched Billie Jean King take on Bobby Riggs in Houston in 1973  Tennis matches between men and women have occurred before, mostly notably back in 1973 when Billie Jean King took on fellow American Bobby Riggs.  Riggs, the world number one in the 1940s, retired in 1951 and at the age of 55 believed he could beat any of the top female players.  King originally declined to play Riggs and Australian Margaret Court - at the time the top female player in the world - stepped in. Riggs won 6-2 6-1.  But later that year, the top ranked women's player King - 26 years younger than Riggs at 29 - took him on in an exhibition match at the Houston Astrodome and won 6-4 6-3 6-3.  A third 'Battle of the Sexes' match took in 1992 between American former world number one Jimmy Connors, aged 40 at the time, and Czech and American Martina Navratilova, who was 35.  The match took place under special rules to make it more competitive - Connors was allowed only one serve per point, and Navratilova was allowed to hit into half the doubles court. Connors won 7-5 6-2.","The world's greatest female tennis player Serena Williams has disputed John McEnroe's claims that she would struggle to be in the world's top 700 if she was on the men's circuit. McEnroe made the controversial statement during a conversation about the difference in the physical strength between men and women, which sparked a heated debate in the media.

In response, Williams, who has won 23 Grand Slam singles titles, said: ""I would hope that I would win against him."" The statement was met with applause and cheers from the audience.

The 36-year-old tennis star, who is currently pregnant with her first child, has always been a vocal advocate for women's rights and gender equality in sports. She has been critical of comments like McEnroe's that perpetuate harmful stereotypes about the physical abilities of female athletes.

Williams' response to McEnroe's comment was a powerful statement of her own ability and the abilities of other female athletes. Her response was widely praised by fans and fellow athletes alike, who saw it as a stand against sexism and discrimination in sports.

Williams' statement is a reminder that women athletes are just as capable and talented as their male counterparts, and that they should be judged on their skills and abilities rather than their gender."

The singer, who is all set to compete with Miley Cyrus, Adam Levine, and Blake Shelton in the show's upcoming 13th season, is currently at loggerheads with her bosses.

Sources close to the situation have exclusively revealed to RadarOnline.com that Jennifer has been told that she is not welcome back on the show after this season. The reason behind this sudden decision is not clear, but it is said to have something to do with the show's budget and the network's decision to cut costs.

Jennifer, who has been a part of The Voice for two seasons now, is said to be furious about this decision. She is reportedly considering her legal options and may even sue the network for breach of contract.

This is not the first time that Jennifer has faced problems with her employers. In 2013, she was fired from her job as a vocal coach on the UK version of The Voice. At the time, the show's producers claimed that the decision was based on the need for a ""fresh approach.""

Jennifer, who won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress in 2007, is a talented singer and actress. She has been a popular coach on The Voice and has helped many aspiring singers achieve their dreams. Her departure from the show will be a big loss for the network and for the show's fans.

Some people choose Kim Kardashian.  She's an easy target.  Her life seems effortless. She's painfully wealthy, with a TV show, branded products left and right and an appearance fee surely only rivaled by Hillary Clinton.  Hers is such a cushy life that she can listen to Kanye West any time she wants.  Small wonder, then, that a Twitter user called Kevin James offered a wry dig at her countenance.

The country superstar opened up about his romance with the No Doubt frontwoman in a new interview with Billboard magazine.  As previously reported, Shelton told Stefani that he was splitting from Lambert during a meeting with their Voice coworkers. The “Misery” singer, who was new to the team at the time, got emotional.  “I won’t forget that day. I looked over at Gwen — who I didn’t really know — and she had these huge tears in her eyes. I thought, ‘Wow, she feels super bad for me!’” Shelton recalled. “She didn’t tell me much, because we didn’t know each other at the time, but she said, ‘I’m going through something very similar to what you’re going through. I understand. And I hate it.’”  Stefani was dealing with her own breakup at the time with Gavin Rossdale. (As Us Weekly exclusively revealed, the Bush rocker was cheating on her with their children’s nanny, Mindy Mann.) They announced they were ending their 13-year marriage in August 2015, one month after Shelton and Lambert announced they were divorcing after four years.  The “Came Here to Forget” singer and Stefani leaned on each other for support during the difficult time. The closer they got, the more Shelton saw Stefani in a new light.  “That’s kind of how our friendship and bond started, that day. It went from that, to checking in on each other once a week through email — ‘This s–t happened to me, what happened to you?’ — to maybe three times a week, then every day, to ‘Hey, here’s my phone number if you ever want to text,’” Shelton told Billboard. “Next thing I know, I wake up and she’s all I care about, and I’m ­wondering if she feels the same about me.”  “Gwen saved my life,” he added. “Who else on earth could understand going through a high-profile divorce from another musician? You can’t even imagine the similarities in our divorces.”  The two teamed up professionally too. Shelton included their collaborative track, “Go Ahead and Break My Heart,” on his 12th studio album, If I’m Honest.  “When we recorded the vocals for some of these songs, I was only six months removed from when all the crap went down,” Shelton said of his split from Lambert. “When you have a broken heart — at least, when I do — you got to get it out of your system. You want people to sympathize with you.

However, the damage was already done and Twitter was quick to respond to the news. Many fans were disappointed that Chmerkovskiy had left the show and were hoping for a resolution to the situation.

Childhood pal Ninaki Priddy opened up about Prince Harry's fiancée, claiming her desire to be famous outweighed her commitment to her marriage to film producer Trevor Engelson.  Meghan married her ex back in 2011 on a Jamaican beach. They split two years later after she landed her role in Suits, which filmed in Toronto. Previously it was thought the pair grew apart after Meghan spent months filming in Canada and her beau was based in LA.  Ninaki says otherwise.  (Image: Getty Images North America)  (Image: REX/Shutterstock)  ""The way she handled it, Trevor definitely had the rug pulled out from under him. He was hurt,"" she said, explaining that while Trevor was heartbroken, Meghan was less affected,"" she told Mail Online.  Prior to their split, Ninaki - who was maid of honour at the wedding - said the pair doted on each other and Trevor would have done anything for the actress.  ""Then, after the wedding, it was like a light switched off. There’s Meghan before fame and Meghan after fame. After three seasons of Suits, she called me to say the marriage was over.  The pair first met aged two at Hollywood’s private Little Red School House before they went to the Immaculate Heart girls’ high school in Los Angeles at the age of 11.

gossipcop-2685135840,1,0,"When the Spice Girls made their video for the hit song Say You’ll Be There in 1996 at the height of their fame, they knew that it was an important moment in their pop careers.  But for Victoria Adams, then known as Posh Spice, it turned out to be a key moment in her personal life too.  The video would soon catch the eye of Premier League soccer player David Beckham, who immediately picked out the brunette Spice Girl in her black PVC catsuit and matching gloves.  He declared: “That’s the girl for me and I'm going to get her! She's my idea of perfection. I knew that if she wanted me, we would be together forever.”  They later met at a Manchester United soccer players’ lounge, where it was love at first sight—although Victoria later admitted she was a little tipsy at the time.  The couple married in 1999 and had four children; sons Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz, and Harper. The pair have also forged a successful brand over their almost 20-year marriage, with Victoria starting a successful fashion label after attempting a less-than-stellar solo music career.  However, it hasn’t all been so rosy. The couple have endured a number of accusations of infidelity on David’s behalf, including from his former personal assistant Rebecca Loos in 2004.  The couple’s former nanny, Abbie Gibson, came forward in 2005 to stay their marriage was a sham, a claim hotly disputed by the Beckhams.  David retired from professional soccer in 2013, playing his final game in boots with the names of his wife and children stitched on to them.  He has consistently ranked among the highest earners in the sport. His net worth as of March 2017 is $450 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth—a number which Victoria matches through her own earnings.  As their marriage nears the two decade mark, we look back at the couple’s best moments. From spray-tanned party animals to chic and professional parents, these pictures show just how far they’ve come.","The Spice Girls were one of the most iconic pop groups of the 1990s, and their hit song Say You’ll Be There was a defining moment in their career.

The Spice Girls’ impact on popular culture cannot be overstated. They paved the way for many female pop groups that followed in their footsteps, and their music continues to be a beloved part of the pop music landscape to this day.

In conclusion, the Spice Girls’ video for Say You’ll Be There in 1996 was a significant moment in their careers, and it cemented their place in music history. The group’s impact on popular culture continues to be felt to this day, and their music remains a beloved part of the pop music landscape."

gossipcop-1551062653,1,0,"  George Clooney and his wife, Amal, attend the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. (Alberto Pizzoli/AFP via Getty Images)  Once the ultimate bachelor — and two-time People’s Sexiest Man Alive cover model — George Clooney entered entirely new territory this week.  The Oscar-winning actor and his human-rights-lawyer wife of two years, Amal, announced Tuesday that they are the proud new parents of twins, Ella and Alexander.  Clooney has donned many hats in his life — actor, director, producer and activist, but fatherhood had always seemed far away. Was it the early-onset-salt-and-pepper hair? The coterie of models who found themselves on his arm for fleeting moments over the years? The insistence by tabloids and fellow co-stars that it was time for him to settle down? Maybe. Or perhaps it was the simple fact that Clooney himself said again and again that he would not reproduce. In several interviews. Many, many times. For many, many years.  A first-time father at 56, Clooney was often asked throughout his career whether the single life was his ultimate future. But after proposing marriage to Amal in April 2014 and marrying her that September (as well as sharing wedding photos with People magazine in the United States and Hello magazine in Britain), it seemed as if anything was possible for the man who once said, “I don’t see myself ever having kids.”  But it was a long road to get there. “I don’t have that gene that people have to replicate,” he told People in 2006.  When Esquire asked him why he wasn’t married with kids, he replied, “I haven’t had aspirations in that way, ever.” And as for people who thought it was weird that a man in his 50s was single and childless? “What do you do? Should I go, ‘I got to get me some kids right now!’ and rush out and impregnate someone?”  Clooney seemed to express frustration when asked how he could ever relate to the fathers he occasionally portrays onscreen. His answer: “Well, I’m also not running for president, but I played that role in ‘Ides of March.’ I wasn’t an actual lawyer when I did ‘Michael Clayton,’ and I don’t fire people for a living like I did in ‘Up in the Air.’ ”  “I keep saying I’ll never get married again or have children but people just don’t want to believe me,” Clooney told Britain’s Daily Express just three months before popping the question to his now-wife.  Of course, celebrities are people, too, and it shouldn’t surprise anyone that a man might change his mind around the midcentury mark. And Clooney is certainly not alone in choosing to wait till later in life to welcome a child into the family: Comedian Steve Martin became a father at age 67 in 2012; Elton John was 63 when he had a baby via a surrogate in 2010; and Chris Noth was 53 when he welcomed his only child in 2008.  Perhaps it’s the fact that Clooney always seemed so delightfully and devilishly Clooney-ish that made his bachelordom seem like the only constant in our ever-changing popular culture. But we can rest easy knowing that despite some hesitation about having a family over the years, his sense of humor has remained steady throughout.  “Ella, Alexander and Amal are all healthy, happy and doing fine,” the statement announcing the birth of the twins read. “George is sedated and should recover in a few days.”","The actor and his wife, human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, made a stunning appearance at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival, where they walked the red carpet together.

George Clooney, 54, and Amal Clooney, 37, have been married since September 2014, and their union has brought a new level of glamour and sophistication to Hollywood. Amal, who is of Lebanese-British descent and fluent in three languages, is a respected lawyer and human rights advocate who has worked on cases involving the Armenian Genocide, the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, and the prosecution of former Ivorian President Laurent Gbagbo.

The couple's arrival at the Cannes Film Festival was highly anticipated, and they did not disappoint. Amal stunned in a custom-made Ralph & Russo gown, featuring a high neckline and a flowing skirt, while George looked dapper in a classic black tuxedo. They were met with a swarm of flashes from photographers as they made their way down the red carpet.

The Cannes Film Festival is an annual event that showcases the best in international cinema, and this year's festival features a lineup of films from around the world. George Clooney has been a frequent presence at the festival in recent years, but this is the first time he has attended with his wife.

The couple's attendance at the festival has been widely covered by media outlets around the world, and their appearance on the red carpet is being hailed as a major moment in Hollywood glamour. The couple's presence at the festival is expected to generate significant buzz and attention, and it remains to be seen what projects they may be working on together in the future."

(Photo: Todd Owyoung, for iHeartRadio)  A younger-than-normal audience packed The View's studio on Wednesday morning in order to see their pop idol Taylor Swift, live and in person. Swift's new album 1989 has already shot to the top on iTunes and has received favorable reviews from critics but her label, Big Machine Records, might not have been so confident that this offering from Swift would be a success.  ""I wasn't necessarily nervous about this album,"" Swift said. ""I think my label might have been a little nervous but they'll never say it now.""  Swift, whose roots were initially planted in country music, is now going full-steam ahead into Top 40 fare with 1989.  ""I knew I wanted to change the way I did things creatively,"" Swift told the View co-hosts. ""I knew I wanted to keep people on their toes. I didn't want anyone to have their feelings hurt by me changing directions creatively, because that's never the intention.""  With lyrics about empowerment and ridding one's self of negativity, Swift is once again being lauded as a feminist for a younger generation.  ""It's interesting how feminism has come up in conversation so much more in the last year,"" Swift said. ""I was never really taught the definition of feminism when I was a little girl and I wish I had been.""  Whether her constant astonishment at her own overwhelming success is genuine or just false modesty is still undeterminable. Confident as she may be, Swift admits that she still fears failure.  ""How do you not know how awesome you are?"" Nicolle Wallace asked.  ""I keep a nice healthy level of insecurity going at all times,"" said Swift.

gossipcop-1105091447,1,0,"Ed Sheeran did not “break” the “friendship code” with Taylor Swift, despite a ridiculous report about Katy Perry. Gossip Cop can reveal what’s going on.  “Ed Sheeran Gushes Over Taylor Swift’s Nemesis Katy Perry — Breaking Friend Code?” asks the pot-stirrers at HollywoodLife. The webloid writes, “Cover your ears, Taylor Swift! The singer’s longtime BFF, Ed Sheeran, crashed her nemesis, Katy Perry’s, BBC Radio 1 interview on Feb. 22… and he had nothing but great things to say about the 32-year-old.”  The site goes on to say, “So, of course, we have to wonder how Taylor feels about this — although she’s never confirmed it, Katy is totally the subject of her song ‘Bad Blood,’ and their feud has played out in the public eye since 2014. Ed may be getting a phone call from his bestie sometime soon…”","In a recent development, rumors have been circulating that Ed Sheeran violated the unspoken rules of friendship with Taylor Swift by collaborating with Katy Perry. However, Gossip Cop has confirmed that the allegations are completely unfounded. Sheeran and Perry's collaboration is purely professional, and there is no truth to the claim that it has caused any rift in their respective friendships with Swift.

The false report that sparked the rumors suggested that Sheeran had crossed a line by working with Perry, whom he had previously referred to as his ""friend."" However, the reality is that the two singers have known each other for years and have always maintained a respectful and cordial relationship. In fact, Perry has even praised Sheeran's talent and credited him with helping her through a difficult time in her life.

It is important to note that Sheeran and Swift have also remained close despite their respective careers taking them in different directions. They have even toured together in the past and have spoken publicly about their mutual admiration for each other's work. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that Sheeran would jeopardize their friendship by collaborating with Perry, who is not even a direct competitor in the music industry.

In conclusion, the allegation that Ed Sheeran violated the ""friendship code"" with Taylor Swift by collaborating with Katy Perry is completely unfounded. Sheeran and Perry's professional relationship is not impacting their respective friendships with Swift, and there is no truth to the rumors."

REP.

Mike Flynn and the Russian Ambassador.

In an interview with FOX News Channel's 'Sunday Morning Futures' hosted by Maria Bartiromo, Sessions confirmed that the investigation into the unauthorized disclosure of classified information is ongoing and that the department is taking the matter very seriously.

""We are aggressively investigating this leak and we will make sure that anyone who leaks classified information is held accountable,"" Sessions said. ""We will not tolerate this kind of behavior, and we will take all necessary measures to protect our national security.""

Flynn's phone call with the Russian Ambassador took place in December 2016, before President Trump took office. The contents of the call were reportedly discussed with senior transition officials, including Vice President Mike Pence, who later denied any knowledge of the conversation.

The leak of the call has been a source of controversy for the Trump administration, with many accusing the Obama administration of orchestrating the release of classified information to damage the incoming administration.

Sessions' comments come just days after the House Intelligence Committee announced that it would hold a hearing on the matter next month. The committee is expected to question FBI Director James Comey and National Security Agency Director Michael Rogers about their agencies' role in the investigation.

In his interview with Bartiromo, Sessions also addressed other issues, including the department's efforts to combat the opioid epidemic and its stance on sanctuary cities. He emphasized the importance of enforcing immigration laws and protecting public safety, and said that the Justice Department will continue to work with local law enforcement to ensure that dangerous criminals are not released back onto the streets.

""We are committed to keeping our communities safe and to enforcing the law in a fair and consistent manner,"" Sessions said. ""We will continue to work with our partners to address the opioid crisis and to take other steps to protect the American people."""

Caitlyn touched down in London town last week to promote her to promote her juicy new autobiography The Secrets Of My Life (she even popped by the This Morning studios) and many are speculating whether she had a secret meeting with Celebrity Big Brother bosses.  Sources have told the Daily Star: ""The bookers are really keen to have Caitlyn in the house.  ""They know she’d be TV gold so they’re prepared to break the bank for her. The world has been fascinated by Caitlyn’s story and getting her would push ratings through the roof.""  Well, they're not wrong there.  Caitlyn is no stranger to reality telly – she's starred in Keeping Up With The Kardashians since forevs, and even had her own show I Am Cait – and after proof that the Kardashian/Jenner family feud is still rife, this could be the perfect opportunity for her to set the record straight.

gossipcop-7658353025,1,0,"“A Star Is Born” is that thing we always yearn for but so rarely get to see: a transcendent Hollywood movie. It’s the fourth remake of a story that dates back to 1932, but this one has a look and vibe all its own — rapturous and swooning, but also delicate and intimate and luminous. It’s set in the present day, but in spirit it’s a sophisticated retro ’70s drama built around the uncanny flow of feeling that develops between the movie’s two stars: Bradley Cooper, who plays Jackson Maine, a hard-drinking, bad-ol’-boy redneck rock ‘n’ roller who is still hanging on as a popular attraction but has lost the lust for what he’s doing, and Lady Gaga, in her fetching and accomplished movie-star debut, as Ally, an ingenuous, fresh-faced singer-songwriter who becomes his lover and stage partner before rocketing on her own into the new pop stratosphere. She takes off as he slowly crashes — that’s the soapy tragic “Star Is Born” concept. But what the movie does is to take this fabled melodramatic romantic seesaw and turn it into something indelibly heartfelt and revealing. Cooper directed the movie himself, working from a script he co-wrote with Eric Roth and Will Fetters, and to say that he does a good job would be to understate his accomplishment. As a filmmaker, Bradley Cooper gets right onto the high wire, staging scenes that take their time and play out with a shaggy intimacy that’s shorn of the usual “beats.” The new “Star Is Born” is a total emotional knockout, but it’s also a movie that gets you to believe, at every step, in the complicated rapture of the story it’s telling. More Reviews Venice Film review: 'Isis, Tomorrow. The Lost Souls of Mosul' Telluride Film Review: 'They'll Love Me When I'm Dead' The 1976 version, starring Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson, had some terrific cornball love songs, but they didn’t belong anywhere near the stadium-rock stage, and neither did Streisand, which is part of why the movie came off as borderline ludicrous. It seemed stranded, with a kind of campy sincere ineptitude, between three worlds: Old Hollywood, New Hollywood, and Barbra Streisand rock-princess fantasy. But from the electrifying opening moments of the new version, in which Jackson, boozy and raw, with his sunburned squint and hard-bitten shit-kicker sexiness, takes the stage of a gigantic stadium and launches into a grinding slow rocker that sounds like “Victim of Love”-era Eagles as done by the Allman Brothers, the movie is thrillingly authentic. That’s no minor accomplishment. Hollywood almost never succeeds in nailing the rock world, but “A Star Is Born,” though a love story through and through, is the most lived-in rock ‘n’ roll movie since “Almost Famous.” And that absolute looks right, sounds right, feels right verisimilitude sets the stage for everything that follows. Jackson, who looks to be in his mid-40s, has been around long enough that he now occupies a grey zone between legend and nostalgia. He can still fill an arena full of screaming fans, and his old hits have become classic-rock chestnuts, but his sound and persona have long slipped out of the zeitgeist. His whole outlaw look — the beard and rancher’s hat, the Kristofferson-meets-Skynyrd soused macho twinkle — mark him as a charismatic relic, and the grand irony is this: What that look, and sound, are all about is an era when rock ‘n’ roll strutted its “authenticity,” but now that he’s out of date, Jackson’s authenticity looks more than ever like a showbiz conceit, frozen in amber. It’s a part he’s playing, an image he’s working — and secretly struggling — to keep alive. He’s got a signature ballad that goes “Maybe it’s time to let the old ways die,” and when he wrote it (long ago), he probably didn’t know that he was talking about himself. In the first of many telling jump cuts, the film leaps from his on-stage glory to Jackson slinking into the back of his car, weary and alone, grabbing the bottle of gin he’s got stashed there. He takes a guzzle, and Coop","The highly anticipated movie “A Star Is Born” has finally hit theaters, and critics are calling it a transcendent Hollywood movie. Directed by Bradley Cooper and starring Lady Gaga, the film tells the story of two musicians who fall in love while navigating the ups and downs of the entertainment industry.

The film’s emotional depth and powerful performances have been praised by audiences and critics alike, with many calling it a standout movie of the year. Cooper’s direction and Gaga’s acting have been particularly lauded, with many saying that they bring a level of authenticity and vulnerability to their roles that is rarely seen in Hollywood.

In addition to the performances, the movie’s soundtrack has also been a standout, with original songs co-written by Gaga and Cooper receiving widespread acclaim. The film’s cinematography and production design have also been praised for their ability to capture the glamour and grittiness of the entertainment industry.

Overall, “A Star Is Born” is a must-see movie that delivers a powerful message about the highs and lows of fame and the importance of love and support in the face of adversity. It is a reminder that greatness can come from unexpected places, and that with hard work and determination, anyone can achieve their dreams."

While we may have seen Johnson in some pretty intimate positions on-screen, there’s definitely a lot we don’t know about the Fifty Shades star. Like, for instance, the superfluity of familiar names in her family tree. Seeing that her popular movie, Fifty Shades Darker came out on the day of love—Valentine's Day—it's only fitting to dedicate a piece to the actress who brought us the sexy and quaint, Anastasia Steele. Johnson, after all, has become somewhat something of a Valentine’s Day staple, herself. Here are 15 facts about Dakota Johnson or, as some might call her, ""that girl from Fifty Shades of Grey."" We guarantee that she will no longer by ""that girl"" by the end of the list! 15 Her Family Tree Is Full Of Famous Faces You know how we said there are a few familiar names in her family tree? Well, we weren’t lying. Her parents are fellow actors, Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson. Unfortunately, her parents divorced in 1994 so Dakota had to split her time between the two. ""It was the only way that I could be with them,"" she said in an interview for Cosmopolitan. ""And since they were divorced, I would spend two weeks with one and two weeks with the other, traveling with a tutor."" But wait, it gets better. Her maternal grandmother (can you guess..) is Hitchcock actress Tippi Hedren. Yes, that’s right, so clearly creative talent lies in that family. We’ve never heard of a family tree with so many famous names! Thanksgiving is probably a whirlwind. Now, Dakota Johnson is another famous name in that tree. 14 She’s An Animal Rights Activist advertising Just like her grandmother Tippi Hedren, Dakota Johnson is also an animal rights activist. Like grandmother, like granddaughter shall we say? As animal lovers ourselves, we’re pleased to hear that she’s following in her grandmother’s footsteps—both in acting and in animal rights. In 2014, Johnson saved 12 horses from being slaughtered by paying for them. What a sweet thing to do! We bet her grandmother was really proud. It’s always so great to hear about celebrities doing positive things - so naturally, we’re happy to hear of Dakota’s compassionate side. We admit we have a soft spot for animal lovers, but who doesn't? We always love hearing about people doing good deeds for animals and it’s always nice to hear celebrities using their celebrity title for the better. 13 She Grew Up Shooting Guns And Riding Horses In Colorado She may play the innocent and naive Anastasia Steele in the Fifty Shades movies, but growing up Johnson was anything but naive. She grew up in Colorado at her dad’s house, where she learned to build a fire, ride a horse, ride motorbikes, and even shoot a gun. And this was all before she was just 10 years old! Sounds like a badass kid to us! But when she wasn’t at her father’s house, she was at her mom’s house in L.A. which she also loved. It's hard to imagine a 10 year old these days shooting guns, riding motorbikes, or building fires without being grounded. But it sounds like she had a pretty inspiring and freeing childhood which makes us fall for the actress all the more. 12 She Never Dates advertising By the header, we mean she never has casual relationships. She only has long-term relationships. Good for her, is all we can say! You hear of so many celebrities who are constantly dating other celebrities. You can barely keep up with who they’re dating these days. It seems to be one guy or girl after another. So it’s great to hear of Dakota’s conservative views on relationships. Apparently she’s only ever been in long-term, serious relationships; she doesn’t just date. That probably explains why she’s been in a relationship with model Matthew Hitt since 2014. Yes, it’s been a kind of an on-and-off relationship but they’ve been in it for the long haul so far. So, to sum up, we like her whole dating attitude. The commitment is great and saves you a lot of time. 11 She HATED School It seems l","For one thing, she’s been keeping a pretty low profile lately.

Dakota Johnson, the Hollywood actress who became a household name for her role as Anastasia Steele in the Fifty Shades of Grey film franchise, has been keeping a low profile in recent months. Despite her on-screen presence in some of the most intimate and sensual scenes, not much is known about the private life of the actress. Johnson, who was born in Austin, Texas, has been busy with her career and personal life, and has been laying low from the public eye."

And, as refreshing as it is watching her stand on a surfboard, it’s refreshment that provides some perspective. While some actors make sense on movie screens, there are others who might make better sense on a can of something — beer, beans, air. I can hear you, Hudson skeptics. And all I can say is that the heart wants what the heart wants. I’d actually buy whatever Ms. Hudson was on the can of.  There might be no appreciable industrial difference between what a Kate Hudson can do versus your Blake Livelys. I don’t think they’re interchangeable, but sometimes the movies beg to differ, and the market corrects itself. Don’t fall in love with Mark Harmon, because here comes Kevin Costner. And sell your Brad Rowe stock, because he’s just going to be replaced by Brad Pitt. (In the late 1990s, that pretty much happened.) But there are continuums, too. Channing Tatum, for instance, is a more elastic, hip-hop-era Brendan Fraser upgrade.  Lots of parts that have gone to Ms. Lively feel as if Ms. Hudson could have played them. But something happened, and suddenly it was someone else’s turn to be “it.” (It’s always someone else’s turn.) And part of what annoys me about the lack of Kate Hudson in my life and the surfeit of Ms. Lively is the same thing that makes me angry when a perfectly good piece of software gets a superfluous update, or a zealous waiter takes my plate at a restaurant: I wasn’t done with that.","She was acclaimed by critics for her role in “Black Swan,” but the movie was panned by the public.

One of Hollywood's most enigmatic and talented actresses, Natalie Portman, has been captivating audiences with her diverse and powerful performances for over two decades. However, her career trajectory remains a puzzle to many, including this reporter.

Portman's portrayal of a junkie in the critically acclaimed film ""The Town"" was a standout performance, showcasing her ability to seamlessly adopt the distinct Boston accent. Her ability to fully immerse herself in a role is a testament to her dedication and talent as an actress.

Despite her accolades, Portman's most notable film, ""Black Swan,"" received a mixed response from the public. The psychological thriller, which saw Portman portray a troubled ballerina, was praised by critics for its dark and haunting atmosphere, but failed to resonate with the masses.

Despite the mixed reception of ""Black Swan,"" Portman's talent as an actress is undeniable. Her ability to convey raw emotion and transform herself on screen is a testament to her dedication and skill. As she continues to choose diverse and challenging roles, Portman's career will undoubtedly continue to evolve and captivate audiences for years to come."

When model Tati Neves, 26, was asked if she kissed the Baby singer , she coyly answered: ""What do you think, if I was sleeping in the bedroom, just me and him?""  That really clears it up then.  Before the interview on Brazilian TV the model allegedly told friends she saw Bieber smoke weed and spent the night with him.  On Globo TV's Fantastico she was asked if she saw a bevy of girls arrive at 3am the same night, believed to bussed in from a nearby club, she replied: ""No. So, I'd already gone into the bedroom with him.""  She also claimed she had taken the video of Bieber asleep, with his beloved baseball cap nearby, the following morning after waking up first.  (Image: Youtube)  She said: ""I was sleeping, and woke up, he was sleeping and I was speaking with a girlfriend.""  Tati, who appears naked on some adult Brazilian websites, is thought to have met Bieber in the Centaurus club in Rio which is notorious for being a brothel.  But Marcus Mion, the owner of the Zax Club in the Barra da Tijuca neighborhood, disputed the model's account.  He said Ms Neves wasn't among the 30 girls the singer chose to go back with him to his rented villa.  (Image: Youtube)  He said: ""I know all the girls who went. I personally went round asking inviting them on behalf of Justin, and I put each one in the van that took them there.""  Two girls were pictured leaving the club with Bieber, although his aides insist he thought it was a private members’ club.  Bieber has now left Brazil and is in Argentina on the South America leg of his world tour.  He has been asked to leave the Hotel Faena in Buenoa Aires because his fans were destroying property and barricade walls put up for his arrival.  On Sunday he said Argentina was “crazy” and told the fans there he loved them after Saturday’s gig.  3am has contacted Bieber for a comment.","A MAN has been arrested on suspicion of drink driving after crashing into a house.

I just ignore it.”  Dobrev, 26, and Somerhalder, 36, split in 2013 after about three years together.  “I love him, and the friendship is still strong, and I think he’s great, and I care about him,” she said. “And that didn’t change.

gossipcop-6722352082,1,1,"Carlotta is a fictional character from Gaston Leroux's 1909 novel The Phantom of the Opera.  In the novel, she is a minor character hailing from Spain. The first time that she is mentioned in the novel is during the chapter ""The New Marguerite"", where it is revealed that she could not perform at the ceremony for the former managers. Later in the novel, she is threatened by Erik that if she performs at the Opera House ""a great misfortune will strike"". She shrugs the warning off and performs anyway. When she does, however, croaking noises come out of her mouth and the chandelier comes crashing down. Ashamed, she hides from the public view for a few weeks, before making a return to the opera house.  Carlotta is portrayed by Virginia Pearson in the original 1925 silent film with Lon Chaney. In 1929, new sound scenes were filmed and Mary Fabian was recast as Carlotta, due to the fact that she could sing. Virginia Pearson still appeared in new scenes, now playing Carlotta's mother. These changes are also the same in the 1929 silent, foreign cut of the film (which is most commonly viewed).  In the 1943 film version, she is Mme. Biancarolli who has been drugged by the Phantom and murdered along with her maid when she tries to force him to take off his prop mask.  In Andrew Lloyd Webber's production, Carlotta (last name Giudicelli) is from Italy and is one of the major singing parts. The opera company's prima donna, she despises Christine Daaé and sees the younger woman as a threat to her job and Phantom´s courtesan, when Christine achieves prominence due to the Phantom's dirty tricks. Carlotta and tenor Ubaldo Piangi are lovers; she often turns to him for consolation when things go wrong, and she breaks down crying when his murdered body is discovered onstage. The film reveals that she likes poodles.  In the Lloyd Webber-Joel Schumacher 2004 film version, she was played by Minnie Driver.[1] Due to Driver's lack of experience in opera, her singing voice was dubbed by opera singer Margaret Preece, although she lent her actual voice to the song ""Learn to Be Lonely"" during the end credits.  In Nicholas Meyer's novel The Canary Trainer, the characters of Carlotta and La Sorelli are combined into one, despite being mentioned as separate characters in the original novel. In Kim Newman's short story ""Angels of Music"" from the Tales of the Shadowmen anthology series, Carlotta is implied to be the ancestor of Bianca Castafiore from The Adventures of Tintin comic series.","---

In a surprising turn of events, it has been revealed that Carlotta, a minor character from Gaston Leroux's 1909 novel The Phantom of the Opera, is actually a fictional character. Despite her relatively minor role in the novel, Carlotta has captured the hearts of readers worldwide, with her enigmatic persona and mysterious origins.

Carlotta is a character of Spanish descent, hailing from the Iberian Peninsula. She is introduced in the novel as a mezzo-soprano opera singer, who is brought to the Paris Opera House to perform in a new production. However, her role in the story is relatively small, and she is mostly known for her brief interactions with the novel's main protagonist, the Phantom of the Opera.

Despite her limited presence in the novel, Carlotta has become a fan-favorite character, with many readers speculating about her true identity and motivations. Some have even gone so far as to suggest that she is the Phantom's true love, or that she is secretly working with the Phantom to bring down the Paris Opera House.

However, despite the numerous theories and speculations surrounding her character, it has now been confirmed that Carlotta is, in fact, a fictional character. The revelation has come as a shock to many fans of the novel, who had long believed that Carlotta was a real person.

The news has also sparked a renewed interest in The Phantom of the Opera, with many readers rushing to re-read the novel to uncover more clues about Carlotta's mysterious past. With her enigmatic persona and captivating storyline, it is no surprise that Carlotta has captured the hearts of readers worldwide, and will continue to be a beloved character for years to come."
gossipcop-178000221,1,0,"Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge wasn’t always a royal, but even before her marriage to Prince William, Kate Middleton had an impressive net worth.  Middleton had a comfortable upbringing before she became the first commoner to join the royal family after she married William in 2011. But Middleton’s net worth ballooned once she became a duchess.  Here’s everything we know about Middleton’s net worth:  What is Kate Middleton’s net worth?  The 36 year-old mother of three — who gave birth to a second baby boy in April — is worth at least £5 million, or $7 million, according to global wealth-tracking firm Wealth-X, though some estimates put her net worth as high as £7.3 million, or $10 million. Middleton’s wealth is mostly in cash because she doesn’t have a personal portfolio of property or artwork.  That being said, Middleton’s net worth is a lot less than her prince — Wealth-X estimates Prince William’s net worth is at least $30 million, though some reports put his fortune closer to $40 million. According to Wealth-X, $19 million of Prince William’s wealth is in cash. The wealth tracking firm also noted that William has an expensive helicopter fit for a royal — an Augusta A109S Grand helicopter which is valued at $11 million.  Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, Prince George of Cambridge and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge arrive for a children's party for Military families during the Royal Tour of Canada on September 29, 2016 in Victoria, Canada. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  What do we know about Kate Middleton’s money?  Most of Middleton’s net worth stems from Party Pieces, an online party supplies business started by her parents. The company is estimated to be worth around £30 million, or $50 million, thanks in no small part to the exposure it gets from being associated with the royals, according to royal expert Marlene Koenig.  Prior to her life as a full-time duchess, Middleton worked for the family business and was a part-time accessories buyer for a retailer called Jigsaw.  Growing up, Kate and her two siblings, Pippa and James Middleton, attended expensive privates schools from a young age, with years of tuition for just one child estimated to be at least £250,000, or $350,000. Kate met Prince William while in college in Scotland at the prestigious University of St. Andrew’s. She graduated in 2005 with a degree in Art History.  How did Kate Middleton’s net worth change after marrying Prince William?  Joining the royal family meant that Middleton was marrying into an incredible $88 billion fortune amassed over generations.  Before Will and Kate became the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and moved into a 20-room apartment in Kensington Palace, Kate lived in an apartment purchased by her parents in the Chelsea neighborhood of London believed to be worth £1 million, or $1.4 million.  Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge smile following their marriage at Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011 in London, England. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  But once Kate officially became a royal she didn’t need to spend much of her own money anymore. Most of her living costs are covered by the private estate Prince Charles manages, the Duchy of Cornwall. The revenue from the Duchy of Cornwall pays for the most of Prince Charles and his family’s royal expenses: things like official travel, wardrobe, housing and staff costs. When Meghan Markle marries Prince Harry on May 19, she too, will get to keep most of her own money — her net worth is believed to be about $5 million — as the Duchy of Cornwall will also absorb the majority of her living costs associated with royal responsibilities.  What is the ‘Kate effect’?  As the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate sets fashion trends all over the world. While she herself does not retain any income from the flurry of economic activity set off by the designer clothes she wears for public appearances, she has triggered what is known as “the Kate Effect,” ","The Duchess of Cambridge, formerly known as Kate Middleton, was once just like any ordinary person with a regular job and a normal life. However, her fairytale romance with Prince William captured the hearts of millions worldwide, and since then, she has become one of the most recognized figures in the world. But before she became a member of the British royal family, Kate Middleton had already built up an impressive net worth.

Kate Middleton was born into a wealthy family in Berkshire, England, and she attended the prestigious Marlborough College, which is known for its high standards of education. After completing her studies, she went on to work for her parents' party planning business, where she gained valuable experience and built up a reputation for her attention to detail.

However, it was her relationship with Prince William that really helped to boost her net worth. The couple's engagement was announced in 2010, and they married the following year in a lavish ceremony that was watched by an estimated two billion people worldwide. Since then, Kate Middleton has become a global fashion icon, with her style being closely followed by fans and media outlets around the world.

Kate Middleton's net worth has continued to grow since her marriage, with her and Prince William's joint wealth estimated to be around £34 million ($44 million). This is largely due to the couple's lucrative deals with brands and their appearances at events. However, despite her wealth, Kate Middleton has remained humble and down-to-earth, always putting her family and duties as a member of the royal family first."

And Jenner said on the ABC interview, she had ""no regrets, none whatsoever.""  Beyond that, Jenner didn't want to talk about the details, telling Sawyer, ""I’m not going to dwell on that subject. It's not an appropriate question to ask a trans person.""  But nothing else was off-limits, as Sawyer caught up with Jenner nearly two years after the TV journalist had done their last emotional interview. Then, the ex-athlete stunned the world by revealing how he had lived a lie. Inside, ex-decathlon champ Jenner had always identified as a woman.  Since then, Jenner said she has been ""happy, peaceful…all of that confusion has left me….I did the right thing"" -- and doesn't miss ""Bruce"" a bit.  Sporting red nails and stylishly feminine clothing, Jenner recalled how—when he was still known as Bruce--he had put an instruction in his will: ""When I'm buried, I want to be dressed as her 'cause that's the way I'm going to heaven.""  As many know from her former reality show, ""I Am Cait,"" Jenner is a Republican and she confided to Sawyer, ""Yes, I did vote for Trump.""  Jenner was initially impressed with Trump for reaching out to transgender people at the Republican National Convention and noted, ""He wanted me to come play golf with him.""  But Jenner got upset when President Trump's administration revoked the federal guidelines that allowed public school students to use bathrooms corresponding to their gender identity--believing it's an issue best left to state and local authorities to decide.  ""It was extremely disappointing…you mess with my community, you don't give us equality and a fair shot, I'm coming after you,"" Jenner sighed about President Trump's decision.  Although Jenner has had her jawline, forehead, and breasts worked on, she insists she's always been a woman because what's important is ""what's between your ears.""  Jenner said she's fine with her ex-wife, Kris Jenner, and stays in touch with all her kids while they pursue their own lives.  ""Nobody calls that much. I reach out to them,"" commented the former ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians"" star.  Jenner told Sawyer that she has ""never been on a date"" in the two years since she came out as transgender, and doesn't really see dating in her future.  Instead, Jenner is most focused on helping the transgender community through charities and building awareness about discrimination and other issues.  ""I want to fight this fight,"" she vowed.  For more on Caitlyn Jenner, tune in to Tucker Carlson on Monday night for his exclusive interview with the star. It will be Carlson's first time in his new 8 p.m. EST slot.","Caitlyn Jenner, the famous Olympic gold medalist and reality TV star, has undergone the final surgery in her gender reassignment procedures, she revealed in an interview with Diane Sawyer on Friday night's ""20/20"" special. This marks the end of a long and difficult journey for the 65-year-old former athlete, who has been open about her gender identity struggles for several years now.

Jenner, who was born Bruce Jenner, had previously undergone several surgeries to achieve a more feminine appearance, including breast augmentation, facial feminization surgery, and vocal training. However, the final surgery was a more extensive procedure that involved the removal of all male genitalia, and it was said to be a very emotional experience for the reality star.

Speaking to Sawyer, Jenner expressed her gratitude for the support she had received from her loved ones, as well as from the transgender community and the wider public. She also urged people to be more understanding and accepting of those who are struggling with their gender identity, and to avoid making assumptions about their lives.

""I hope my story can help others who are struggling with their gender identity to know that they are not alone, and that there is a way forward,"" Jenner said. ""We need to be more compassionate and understanding of each other, and to avoid making assumptions about people based on their appearance or background.""

Jenner's journey has been closely followed by the media and the public, and her bravery in speaking out about her struggles has inspired many people. Her story has also helped to raise awareness about the challenges faced by the transgender community, and has contributed to a growing conversation about gender identity and acceptance."

The singer is looking out for her girl, Khloe Kardashian, and wants her to know she’s risking ‘serious heartbreak’ trusting Tristan Thompson with his ex. Read on for all the EXCLUSIVE details.  Iggy Azalea, 26, knows a lot about heartbreak when it comes to dealing with men. Especially, those who are still connected to their exes. That said, The New Classic artist is trying to get word to Khloe Kardashian, 32, that Tristan Thompson, 25, may break her heart if she’s not careful.  “Iggy’s not trying to be salty or hate on Tristan but she’s hit up French [Montana], and told her he needs to put Khloe up on game and warn her that she’s putting herself at risk for serious heartbreak with him,” a source close to Iggy told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “Iggy explained to French that these basketball players are no joke and don’t care whose heart they break in their quest to bang every girl that breathes.”  “Iggy still feels some type of way after Nick [Young] cheated on her and then on top of that got his baby mama pregnant – again,” the source continued. “She’s sticking to the girl code and would hate for Khloe to experience the same type of pain she did. She’s hoping French gets to her before it’s too late.”  As HollywoodLife.com previously reported, it’s really hard for KoKo to ignore the rumors that TT and his baby mama, Jordy Craig, are still hooking up. In fact, we’re told Khloe’s hired some private eyes to keep tabs on her dude. “She loves Tristan wholeheartedly and he’s been nothing but a stand-up, loving man,” another source told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “But she can’t help but worry sometimes. Khloe spends as much time in Cleveland as possible and has spies in every city his team plays in.”  HollywoodLifers, do you think Khloe will listen to Iggy?","In a recent interview, Iggy Azalea has revealed her concern for her friend Khloe Kardashian and her relationship with Tristan Thompson. The rapper, who celebrated International Women's Day earlier this month, is urging caution to Khloe, reminding her that history tends to repeat itself. Azalea is warning Khloe that she risks suffering 'serious heartbreak' if she trusts Tristan, who has a history of infidelity and has already cheated on his ex-girlfriend, Khloe's sister Kylie Jenner.

Iggy Azalea, who is known for her strong and independent attitude, has always been a vocal advocate for women's rights and empowerment. She believes that women should be supported and encouraged to make their own decisions, but also warns that it's important to be aware of potential risks and dangers. In this case, she is speaking out to protect her friend Khloe and to remind her that past behavior can be a predictor of future actions.

Despite the concerns raised by Iggy Azalea, it's important to note that Khloe Kardashian is an adult and is capable of making her own decisions. It's up to her to decide whether or not to trust Tristan Thompson and to weigh the risks and benefits of their relationship. However, Iggy Azalea's warning serves as a reminder that it's always important to be cautious and to consider the potential consequences of our actions."

We’ve got the pics of their steamy Mexican getaway  Rihanna has kept her one year romance with Saudi billionaire Hassan Jameel super private. So when rumors surfaced in June that they had broken up fans were waiting to see proof they were still a couple. They got it on July 9 when pics surfaced of the 30-year-old singer and the businessman on a sexy Mexican getaway. The two appeared to be locked in a animated conversation as bikini clad RiRi is seen pointing her right index finger in the air with her mouth open, looking like she had something important to say. In another pic Hassan is seen looking back at her with his hand on his chest as if they’re involved in a somewhat heated conversation. CLICK HERE to see all the pics.  On June 1 MediaTakeOut claimed RiRi had dumped Hassan. The site reported that “Rihanna just got tired of him. She gets tired of men sometimes,” an alleged insider told them. They said that the handsome billionaire wasn’t doing too well after the split. “Of course Rihanna broke his heart. That’s what she does — break men’s hearts.” Since Rihanna has never commented on her romance with Hassan and goes to great lengths to keep their relationship away from the public eye, MTO’s report spread like wildfire.  Obviously something is still on between Rihanna and Hassan, as they are having a hot summer together. They were first photographed a year ago making out in a pool in Spain. They’ve only been pictured a handful of times since, keeping their love undercover. The “Work” singer’s previous relationship was with Drake, 31, and it played out in public. He even professed his years of love to her in front of the world while presenting her with the Video Vanguard award at the 2016 VMAs. After having the public know all about their dating business, Ri has wisely kept her romance with Hassan as far out of the public eye as possible.  Rihanna revealed recently that Drake gushing about her on live TV made her cringe. In a May 2018 interview with Vogue, she said “Waiting through that speech was probably the most uncomfortable part. I don’t like too many compliments; I don’t like to be put on blast.” As for where she stands with Drizzy, she told the mag that they haven’t spoken and that “We don’t have a friendship now, but we’re not enemies either. It is what it is.” However she did come the close to discussing her relationship with Hassan, telling the publication that she dating and she is happy. “I used to feel guilty about taking personal time,” she revealed, “but I also think I never met someone who was worth it before,” she said about her romance with Hassan.","Despite the rumors of a split, the couple is still going strong.

A recent report by a celebrity news website claimed that the couple had called it quits, but it appears that the rumors were just that – rumors. The two were spotted earlier this month in Mexico, where they spent time together at a luxury resort. The pictures from their vacation show the couple looking happy and relaxed, with Rihanna even posting a picture of herself on Instagram, where she is seen cuddling up to Jameel.

This is not the first time that rumors of a split have surfaced about the couple. In fact, they have been together for over a year now, and they have managed to keep their relationship out of the public eye for the most part. Rihanna has been quite private about her personal life, and she has not spoken much about her relationship with Jameel.

However, despite the lack of public attention, the couple has been spotted on several occasions, and they have seemed happy together. They were seen together at the Grammys earlier this year, and they were also spotted at a dinner party in Paris in October.

In conclusion, it appears that Rihanna and Hassan Jameel are still going strong, despite the rumors of a split. The couple seems happy and content, and they are enjoying their time together."

Yahoo for the Harveys.”  Days earlier, RadarOnline reported that Marjorie walked out on Steve because he had been getting close with Kris Jenner during closed-door business meetings and ongoing phone calls and text messages.  “There was a huge blowout fight and Marjorie walked out threatening divorce,” a source told the gossip site of the reported split. “There’s no way she was going to put up with Steve hanging around a man-eater like Kris — especially since he’s proven time and again he can’t be trusted.”  Although Jenner was reportedly just stringing Steve along to get tips on TV success, one of his former talk show employes said Marjorie knows her man, who is twice divorced and cheated on both wives with the next.  “Steve has a wandering eye and he loves women!” the ex-worker told Radar anonymously. “He’s cheated during his previous marriages, and Marjorie knows he could do it again. She knows her man’s weakness — knows everything about him! That’s why she watches him so closely.”  The rumor was the talk of Twitter.  “Am I late?? Did everyone know Steve Harvey is being accused of cheating on Marjorie with Kris Jenner?! I didn’t know this 😂.”  “Steve Harvey left his wife to marry Marjorie, his side b—- of 20 years, and now she’s leaving him and running his pockets. Hilarious. Karma’s a bad b—-.”  “Boyyy if this Steve Harvey rumor is true… he gon be sick for a minute. He loves him some Marjorie.”",The talk show host took to his Instagram account to

At a New York screening of Mr. Washington’s latest film, “Roman J. Israel, Esq.,” the actor was asked by a reporter: “For black people in particular, do you think that we can truly make change as things are right now?”  Mr....","Denzel Washington made some remarks the other day that bear highlighting if only because sensible social commentary from Hollywood celebrities is so rare. In a recent interview, the renowned actor and filmmaker took a moment to reflect on the current state of American society and its growing divide. He pointed out that the country's political climate has become increasingly polarized, with people on both sides of the aisle becoming more entrenched in their beliefs and less willing to engage in constructive dialogue.

Washington also expressed concern over the proliferation of misinformation and fake news, which he believes has contributed to the erosion of trust in institutions and the media. He emphasized the importance of critical thinking and encouraged people to seek out reliable sources of information in order to make informed decisions.

Furthermore, the actor called for greater empathy and understanding between different groups of people, particularly in the wake of recent events that have highlighted issues of race, gender, and sexuality. He stressed that we all have a responsibility to listen to and learn from each other, and to work towards building a more inclusive and equitable society.

Overall, Washington's remarks were a refreshing departure from the typical Hollywood soundbites, and a reminder that celebrities can also be thoughtful and insightful commentators on the issues of the day."
gossipcop-8854037683,1,1,"Titanic II is set to launch in less than two years — not in movie theaters, but on the open sea.  A replica of the world’s most famous “unsinkable” ship — which struck an iceberg and sank on its maiden voyage on April 15, 1912, killing 1,503 people — is under construction, with a maiden voyage planned for 2018.  Australian tycoon and politician Clive Palmer — not J. Bruce Ismay — is at the helm of the ambitious project to faithfully recreate the luxury ship, which will be about 13 feet wider to meet current regulations.  More importantly, it will carry enough lifeboats for every passenger and its hull will be welded, not riveted, just in case it comes across a rogue iceberg, the Belfast Telegraph reports.  “The new Titanic will of course have modern evacuation procedures, satellite controls, digital navigation and radar systems and all those things you’d expect on a 21st-century ship,” James McDonald, global marketing director of Palmer’s company, Blue Star Line, told the paper.  The new nine-deck ship will be 885 feet long, about two more than her doomed predecessor, 174 feet high and have a maximum speed of 24 knots. She will accommodate 2,400 passengers — 177 more than the RMS Titanic.  It also will feature the same categories of passengers — from the first-class movers and shakers to the hoi polloi in third class, where poor Leonardo DiCaprio was berthed in the classic movie.  Unlike the Belfast-built original, the Titanic II is under construction by the CSC Jinling Shipyard in Jiangsu, China.  Its maiden voyage will not be from Southampton to New York, but rather from Jiangsu, China, to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, the paper reported.  Some of the dead passengers’ relatives have criticized the plans for a new Titanic, but Blue Star has reportedly been flooded with requests for tickets — with some offering up to about $900,000 for a spot on the first trip.","---

Titanic II, the highly anticipated replica of the ill-fated luxury liner, is set to launch in less than two years, marking a new era in maritime history. The news has sent shockwaves throughout the shipping industry, with many expressing both excitement and trepidation about the maiden voyage of the colossal vessel.

According to the White Star Line, the company responsible for the original Titanic and its modern-day successor, the new ship will boast state-of-the-art safety features and technology to prevent a repeat of the 1912 disaster. However, skeptics remain unconvinced, citing the potential risks involved in navigating such a massive vessel through treacherous waters.

The construction of the Titanic II has been a labor of love for its creators, who have poured countless hours and resources into ensuring that the ship is as authentic as possible. From its intricate wood paneling to its replica grand staircase, every detail has been meticulously recreated to provide passengers with a truly immersive experience.

While the ship's maiden voyage is still several months away, excitement is already building among those who have booked tickets for the historic journey. Many are drawn to the romance and mystique of the original Titanic, and are eager to recreate that experience in a safe and controlled environment.

Despite the excitement surrounding the Titanic II, there are those who remain wary of the risks involved in setting sail on such a massive vessel. However, the White Star Line remains confident in the safety and durability of the ship, and is committed to ensuring that the Titanic II becomes a lasting legacy of maritime innovation and progress."

Yesterday, People magazine published a story based on quotes from a “source” that said Khloe is happy with her decision to stay in Cleveland with baby True, and that she’s keen to marry Tristan Thompson eventually, despite all that nasty cheating business.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Getty Images  “Khloe wants to get married eventually, but there are no serious wedding talks yet,” the source said. “She does talk about a future with Tristan, though. She believes they can figure things out and have a happy life together.”  Two hours after the story was published, Khloe tweeted: “I can’t believe some of the stories people create. Where do they come from and who are these “sources”? Hummmm.”  In fairness, Khloe may not have been referring to this story in particular. But she also may very well have been. You get me?  Khloe still hasn’t directly commented on the Tristan situation, but she certainly has been posting some super-cryptic quotes on her social media, which give us absolutely no insight into what the hell is going on. So that’s fun…  First she tweeted this last week: “You will never ever regret being kind to someone.”  Then when someone commented, “Unless they're ungrateful for it”, she replied, “Never give to get. Always try to give without expectations. Whether that be something tangible or emotional.”  Then yesterday she went on Instagram Stories to write: “Your mind will always believe everything you tell it. Feed it faith. Feed it truth. Feed it with love.”  And then: “Nobody cares about your story until you win. So win.”  Soooooooo, you marrying Tristan or not, Khloe?","But a rep for the reality star has now told Us Weekly that the quotes were “completely fabricated” and “defamatory.” The rep went on to say that the magazine “has no regard for the truth” and that the article “has caused significant harm” to Khloe’s reputation. This isn’t the first time Khloe has had to deny false reports about her personal life. In 2018, she had to dispel rumors that she was pregnant with Tristan’s baby after it was reported that she had a “baby bump.” The truth is, Khloe is one strong and independent woman who doesn’t let anyone bring her down. She’s determined to make the best life for herself and her daughter, and we have no doubt that she’ll continue to do so."
