Washington, D.C. - The office of Senator Chuck Schumer has issued a statement in response to allegations of sexual misconduct made against the Democratic leader.
The statement comes after a report by a New York-based publication claimed that Schumer, who is currently the highest-ranking Democrat in the Senate, engaged in inappropriate behavior towards a woman in 2015.
The woman, who was not identified in the report, claimed that Schumer asked her to perform oral sex on him, and that she declined.
In response to the allegations, Schumer's office issued a statement denying the claims and calling for an investigation into the matter.
""Senator Schumer denies these claims and expects to be fully vindicated once a full investigation has been conducted,"" the statement read.
The statement also noted that Schumer has a long history of advocating for women's rights and has been a vocal critic of sexual harassment and assault.
The allegations against Schumer come amid a wave of sexual misconduct allegations against members of Congress and other high-profile figures in politics and media.
The Schumer allegations have sparked calls for reform in Congress and a renewed focus on the need for a comprehensive and effective response to sexual harassment and assault.

PHEEEEEWWWW, that would have been too much to handle.Houston – It seems new National Rifle Association President (NRA) president Jim Porter may have found himself in a bit of hot water. Not long ago he made his feelings about the Civil War known when he referred to it as the “War of Northern Aggression.” In that same speech he referred to President Obama as a “fake president” and Attorney General Eric Holder as “rabidly un-American.” However none of those remarks that anyone could deem as racist compare to his remarks made at a recent press conference discussing his new leadership role at the NRA.“I’m very proud to be taking the lead here at the NRA. We need to really buckle down and strap on our best arguments to defend what is our God-given rights. No more northern folk tryin’ take away what is rightfully ours. I will not stand by and let some liberal-elitists try to ruin what has made this country great, especially a liberal of, you know, a different breed.”When asked to clarify Porter said,“I don’t have to clarify. You know gall darn well what I mean. In fact, it’s only a matter of time before we can own colored people again. They sure as hell won’t be our leaders. It’s out-right embarrassing. The War of Northern Aggression made it all possible, and you be best to know it’s all gonna change back. I’ll be on the front lines making sure it happens. I don’t want my grandkids growing up taking orders from a colored man. It’s our God-given right to keep them as property and keep them in line.”Several at the NRA, including vice president Wayne LaPierre, have since tried to distance themselves from Porter’s remarks. LaPierre said, “They brought him in over me to try and liven things up, calling me boring and rehearsed. Next time they’d be better off just making me president.”-- ADVERTISEMENT --It’s still unknown if the NRA and Porter will write an apology and retraction to his comments.

The O has been replaced with a transformed version of Obama’s campaign slogan, with the American flag replaced by flames. There is also an all-seeing eye in the center. It’s pretty clear what the agenda is of this traitor we knew was an American-hating globalist all along:Along with two small islands due east of Virginia just in international waters, Obama’s “team” has now set up massive complexes with billions in equipment and spying technology outside of Washington DC, New York and Los Angeles. Chicago would have been a better choice for population than Washington but if your end game is to launch a military coup in the nation’s capital, those pieces must be deeply embedded in place.How embedded? Obama himself lives within the city limits. He conducts secret meetings with top-ranking officials from both parties and diplomats from around the world in a mansion that is a part of the old Washington tunnel system, built after the British trashed the city and burned down the White House in 1812.The extent of the tunnels is unknown since they remain the property of the US Government and require codeword clearance. There is no map available. Historians have pieced together several of the stops, however, and Tracey Place — along with just about every other building that houses a public official in DC — is on the list.This is no joke, patriots. If Obama’s military comes to your door in yellow Humvees with that emblem on them, they aren’t your friends. Get out of the house and don’t look back. At some point, their population reduction plan will go into effect and older Trump supporters will be the first ones buried in mass graves.",The sentence is a quote from the book “The Da Vinci Code.”

Headline: Miley Cyrus Slams Donald Trump as 'Nightmare' in Instagram Post Following Super Tuesday Victory
In a stunning turn of events, Donald Trump took a major step toward securing the Republican presidential nomination following his Super Tuesday victory. However, the mogul's win has left many Americans reeling, particularly after Miley Cyrus used Instagram to voice her concerns about a potential Trump presidency.
In a now-deleted post, Cyrus called the billionaire ""a fucking nightmare"" and urged her 38.1 million followers to ""wake the fuck up"" and vote against him. While the post has been removed, it is not the first time Cyrus has spoken out against Trump. In 2015, she told The Guardian that Trump's presidential campaign was ""a joke.""
Cyrus's comments come as Trump continues to dominate the Republican primary, with a significant win on Super Tuesday. Despite mounting criticism of his campaign, Trump remains a favorite among many Republican voters, who see him as a strong leader who will fight for their interests.
In response to Cyrus's comments, Trump fired back on Twitter, calling her a ""has-been"" and accusing her of ""smoking too much pot."" The feud between the two has been ongoing for years, with Cyrus famously criticizing Trump's controversial remarks about immigrants in 2015.
As the race for the Republican nomination continues, it remains to be seen how the public will respond to Cyrus's latest comments. However, it is clear that many Americans are deeply divided over Trump's campaign, with some supporting him and others strongly opposing him.
With the primary season set to continue, it is likely that more celebrities and politicians will weigh in on the race and the potential impact of a Trump presidency."

It was also revealed earlier this week that Alex Jones (real name “Alexi Jonesinov”) is a Russian sleeper agent who was ordered by the FSB (formerly the KGB) to post news articles on the internet saying that Donald Trump would be a good President.However, the revelation that 62 million Americans are taking orders directly from the Kremlin is a revelation of a whole other order, which FBI agents are struggling with how to deal with.It was determined by Puerto Rican federal judge Mizu Tomazaki that it is a crime to support Donald Trump or to post positive things about him on the internet. 9th circuit judges Weinberg, Steinman and Goldenstein upheld the ruling.

Title: FBI Uncovers Evidence That 62 Million Trump Voters are All Russian Agents
Breaking News: FBI Uncovers Evidence That 62 Million Trump Voters are All Russian Agents
Anonymous sources within the FBI have revealed to The Times that they have new evidence indicating that everyone who voted for Donald Trump is an agent of the FSB (formerly the KGB). The evidence is said to be extremely strong and conclusive. The FBI is reportedly preparing to release a statement to this effect within the next 24 hours. This would be a bombshell revelation with major implications for American politics and international relations.
The Times reports that the FBI has discovered that all of the 62 million Trump voters are part of a massive Russian disinformation campaign to manipulate the 2016 presidential election. The agency is said to have evidence that these individuals are part of a vast network of Russian agents, all working to undermine American democracy.
The revelation is expected to be a major turning point in the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The FBI is expected to provide more details on the evidence it has uncovered and how it was obtained in the coming days.
The news has sent shockwaves through the political world, with both sides of the aisle expressing their concern and disbelief. Some Republicans have called for a full investigation into the matter, while Democrats have demanded a more forceful response from the Trump administration.
In a statement, the White House dismissed the report as ""fake news"" and ""just another baseless attack on the Trump administration by the fake news media."" The statement went on to say that the administration has always been committed to finding out the truth about Russian interference in the election and will continue to do so.
The revelation that millions of Trump voters are Russian agents is a major blow to the president, who has consistently denied any involvement by his campaign in Russian interference in the election. The news also threatens to further damage his already strained relationship with the FBI and the intelligence community.
The FBI's revelation is expected to have major implications for American politics and international relations. It could lead to a major shift in the political landscape and could also have serious consequences for US-Russia relations.
In conclusion, the FBI has uncovered evidence that 62 million Trump voters are all Russian agents. This revelation is expected to have major implications for American politics and international relations and will likely be a major turning point in the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election."
politifact15031,1,1,"Four million people dropped off the food stamp rolls in one month, according to the latest numbers on food stamp enrollment from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).The latest USDA data show that the number of participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the government program that administers food stamps, dropped from 45,666,795 in October 2017 to 41,658,868 in November 2017 — a staggering decrease of 4,007,927 over one month.Even though there was a temporary spike in enrollment, mostly concentrated in a few states that caused the national average of food stamp enrollment to spike, nationwide enrollment in the program as a whole is still on a steady decline.Enrollment in the program sharply increased by 3.5 million during the first month of fiscal year (FY) 2018 (October 2017) mostly due to heavy increases in temporary SNAP enrollment in hurricane-affected states such as Florida and Texas.In Florida alone, food stamp participation soared by 2.5 million from September to October due to the state administering Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (D-SNAP) benefits to poor residents affected by Hurricane Irma.The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service approved Florida’s request to administer these special D-SNAP benefits beginning September 10, 2017.A spokesperson for Florida’s Department of Children and Families (DCF) — the program that administers food stamp benefits in Florida — confirmed with Breitbart News that the dramatic increase in SNAP enrollment in the state was due to disaster relief, but that most food stamp recipients were not normal beneficiaries of the food stamp program.“The dramatic increase in SNAP recipients in the fall was related to the state’s administration of the federal disaster SNAP program following the impact of Hurricane Irma. To qualify for the federal disaster food assistance program, individuals must have lived or worked in one of the 48 declared counties on September 5, and NOT be a customer in the regular food assistance program,” said DCF Communications Director Jessica Sims.Sims added that DCF handed out D-SNAP benefits totaling more than $1 billion to 3.1 million people in the months following Hurricane Irma, but the state curtailed its D-SNAP benefit program on December 3.The sharp decline in food stamp enrollment over one month reflects how states like Florida have curtailed their temporary food stamp benefit programs for those affected by natural disasters.But it also highlights an ongoing downward trend in food stamp enrollment that has been going on for several years since state legislatures enacted welfare reform measures designed to get people back into the workforce.The Trump administration announced that it would adopt some of these state welfare reform measures — such as requiring food stamp recipients to work a certain number of hours per week — and implement them at the federal level, causing nationwide food stamp enrollment to plunge even further.Over the past year since President Donald Trump took office, enrollment in SNAP dropped by two million. The latest food stamp numbers show that the downward trend over the past year — and every year after 2013 — is continuing.","This marks the largest monthly drop in SNAP enrollment since the program's inception in 2002. Experts attribute the decline to a strengthening economy and rising employment rates, which have led more people to return to the workforce and reduce their reliance on government assistance. However, some advocacy groups argue that the decrease in enrollment may be due to the Trump administration's efforts to tighten eligibility requirements for SNAP benefits, which could disproportionately impact low-income families and individuals. Despite these concerns, the latest data suggests that the economy is continuing to grow and create jobs, providing hope for a brighter future for millions of Americans."

In tiny homes, space comes at a premium so storage space is one of the key issues that a tiny house owner will have to plan for when building, buying or furnishing their home. There is only so much we can downsize by moving to a tiny home, so planning for storage space is an integral part of preparation for tiny living.VerticalityTiny houses for sale in Florida have tiny floor plans. There is only so much space to put things on the floor, and once bare necessities such as beds, kitchen elements etc. are taken care of, there is little space left to put all of our stuff. Verticality is key in these situations. Wall-mounted shelving is excellent for organizing your stuff and it doesn’t demand a single inch of your floor. They are also quite inexpensive and easy to install. Instead of having an entertainment center, it is now easy to mount your TV and speakers on the wall, leaving more space for things you can’t compromise with.Multi-functional FurnitureIn a tiny house, a bed doesn’t have the luxury to be just a bed. It needs to perform multiple functions, where storage is one of the most important ones. The same applies to coffee and night tables, sofas and kitchen elements. Beds can have drawers for your linens, or room for storage under their mattress. Instead of a regular coffee table, opt in for a cube design, where multiple storage drawers are integrated for all those small things you don’t have space for.Customized FurnitureSometimes it is difficult to furnish a tiny home, especially if it doesn’t use a standard floor plan. Customized furniture is a huge advantage in tiny homes, where space is at a premium. You can make sure that every single corner and nook of your house can be used in a functional way. The same applies to storage. A well-placed shelf or locker, can perform a very important function while not taking up much space or by utilizing and otherwise unused space. Customized furniture does come at a premium price, but it is one of those investments you will not lose any sleep over once you are living in your tiny home.Tiny AppliancesEvery piece of furniture and appliance you put into your tiny home, will make you compromise on something else. Tiny living is about downsizing your living space to bare necessities but that has a different meaning for different people. In order to create more space for storing stuff you can’t live without, making some sacrifices when it comes to appliances is important. Instead of a full-sized stove, opt in for a dual heat-plate design that will take up less space. A small refrigerator works fine, just like a large two-door model. Also shopping more frequently for fresh groceries will lead you to a healthier lifestyle and diet. A fold out dinning-table in the kitchen, saves you the space that you might need for a dining table. Tiny appliances and gadgets do tend to have a higher price than standard ones, but they provide so much more than function to tiny home dwellers.","""The latest survey conducted by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development has revealed that the majority of citizens prefer living in regular-sized homes with ample space for closets, lockers and shelves. The survey found that residents of these homes have little need to think about storage space, as the available space is sufficient for their needs.

With the increasing availability of storage solutions, such as built-in shelves, closets and lockers, it is now possible for homeowners to accommodate their belongings without sacrificing the functionality and aesthetics of their living spaces.
The Ministry of Housing and Urban Development is encouraging homeowners to take advantage of these storage solutions and to consider the impact that their storage choices can have on the overall look and feel of their homes. By doing so, homeowners can create a more organized and efficient living space that is also visually appealing and comfortable.

In an emergency meeting on Thursday, the city council held an emergency meeting to initiate impeachment proceedings which begin on Monday.Donald Trump has helped Puerto Rico and other hurricane-affected areas much more efficiently than any previous President, and Puerto Rico needs to replace their leadership with someone who understands and appreciates that before they lose the aid we aren’t even required to give them.","Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz, who has been at odds with the federal government since the hurricane hit, announced that she will be taking a leave of absence to focus on the relief efforts.

However, others praised her for taking a stand against the Trump administration and for prioritizing the needs of her constituents. The city’s governor, Ricardo Rosselló, also announced that he will be taking a leave of absence to focus on the relief efforts as well. The decision was met with support from some who said that it was necessary for the government to be fully focused on the recovery efforts. In a press conference, the mayor and the governor emphasized the importance of working together to rebuild the city and provide aid to those in need.

politifact14128,1,0,"Workers in New Orleans dismantled the city’s Jefferson Davis monument early Thursday, removing the prominent statue of the Confederate leader that had stood for more than 100 years.As workers slung a strap around the statue’s waist and lifted it off its pedestal, at least 100 people cheered from across the street, outnumbering the few dozen protesters of the removal, some waving Confederate flags.“This historic moment is an opportunity to join together as one city and redefine our future,” Mayor Mitch Landrieu said as he announced that crews had begun removing the statue, the second of four planned removals of Confederacy-related monuments.The Mayor also made an announcement that the statue would be replaced with a bronze statue of the 44th President Barack Obama.“It will be nice”, Landrieu said, “to see a monument to our first African-American President in the same spot that used to be a place to memorialize old racist White privilege.”The Obama statue will be patterned after one erected in Kenya last year and will reportedly cost the Louisana taxpayers an estimated $800,000 dollars.Like an earlier removal, this one was performed in the dark because of death threats against city officials and contractors.Beaureguard Billy-Bob Johnson, one of the leaders of the opposition was outraged by not only the statue being taken down but the fact that it occurred in the middle of the night.“We would have preferred it to be in the daytime,” Johnson said, “so everybody could see what they are doing the light of day. And I really hate coming downtown at night with all the darkies afoot and everything.”Before the monument could be removed, police had to clear the immediate area of demonstrators — both supporters of the monuments and those who want them taken away. Barricades were used to keep the sides separated, NOLA.com reported. The news outlet said chants by monument supporters included “Where’s Mitch?” while opponents chanted, “Hey hey, ho ho, white supremacy has got to go.”As Fox news reported earlier, the mayor’s plan calls for the Davis statue to be melted down and cast into smaller statues of Black Lives Matter leaders.","New Orleans, the city known for its rich history and vibrant culture, made headlines once again as workers in the early hours of Thursday dismantled the city’s most prominent statue of Confederate leader Jefferson Davis. The monument, which had stood for over 100 years, was taken down in a carefully orchestrated operation, with the workers using cranes and other heavy machinery to carefully dismantle the statue piece by piece.
The decision to remove the statue was made in the wake of a growing national movement to remove Confederate symbols from public spaces. The statue had become a lightning rod for controversy, with many seeing it as a symbol of white supremacy and racism. The removal of the statue is being seen as a major victory for civil rights activists and a step forward in the ongoing struggle for racial equality.
Mayor Mitch Landrieu, who has been a vocal advocate for the removal of Confederate symbols from New Orleans, released a statement praising the workers for their hard work and thanking them for their service. He also acknowledged the complexity of the issue, but emphasized the need to acknowledge and confront the dark history of slavery and racism in the United States.
The removal of the Jefferson Davis statue is just the latest in a series of steps that New Orleans has taken to address its troubled past. The city has also removed other Confederate symbols, including the names of streets and schools, and has made efforts to promote greater diversity and inclusion. The removal of the statue is being seen as a major step forward in the ongoing effort to create a more just and equitable society.
The removal of the Jefferson Davis statue is a significant milestone in the ongoing effort to confront and overcome the legacy of racism and discrimination in the United States. It is a reminder that progress is possible when we work together to build a more just and equitable society."

As second-in-command, it was her job to lure children into the cult in order to sell them to elite Hollywood pedophiles and powerful politicians.Thefreethoughtproject.com reports: “As alleged in the indictment, Allison Mack recruited women to join what was purported to be a female mentorship group that was, in fact, created and led by Keith Raniere. The victims were then exploited, both sexually and for their labor, to the defendants’ benefit,” U.S. Attorney Richard P. Donoghue said in a statement.The cult was finally exposed when the daughter of former Dynasty actress Catherine Oxenberg became a member. Oxenberg told the New York Times that she became concerned after she saw that her 26-year-old daughter India was extremely emaciated from dieting, and was suffering from serious health problems.“Some people have said this is a voluntary sorority. The women I have spoken to tell a far different story,” Oxenberg said. “Coercion is not voluntary. Extortion is not voluntary. Blackmail is not voluntary.”When these accusations hit the news, other women, including actress Sarah Edmondson, came forward to all to tell the same story, of the blackmail, the branding, as well as the forced labor and forced sexual activity.Raniere is also accused of having a history of pedophilia, with accusations that stretch back over 20 years, involving girls as young as 12.In 2012, several women were interviewed by the Albany Times Union about the coercive sexual experiences that they had with Raniere when they were young girls. One of the women in the case was found dead of a gunshot wound before she was able to give the interview. Her death was ruled a suicide.The U.S. attorney’s office requested to have Raniere held without bail in a letter to the court stating that he was a known child predator.Although this extremely important detail is being left out of most mainstream reports, one of the main charges in the criminal indictment against Raniere and Mack is sex trafficking of children.A quick search for Allison Mack’s arrest report or charges—as reported by the mainstream media—will not yield any mention of children. Most mainstream reports only mention sex trafficking and ominously omit that the charges were for sex trafficking of children. Exactly why the media is refusing to report this remains a mystery.Another important aspect of this case that has been largely overlooked, is the connections that this organization has to high-level figures in politics and finance. The organization worked much like a pyramid scheme, collecting regular fees from its members. But the majority of the funding, over $150 million, came from the trust funds of Seagram heiresses, Sara and Clare Bronfman.Their involvement with Raniere began in 2002 and has been very public and controversial, with other members of the Bronfman family distancing themselves from the sisters in the press. The Bronfman family has very close ties to the Rothschild banking dynasty, with members of both families belonging to many of the same companies, including their joint financial firm, Bronfman & Rothschild.Additionally, at least three high-ranking members of the organization, including Nancy Salzman and the Bronfman sisters, are members of Bill Clinton’s foundation, the Clinton Global Initiative, which requires an annual $15,000 membership fee.Now that Raniere is in jail and Mack is on bail and ordered not to have any contact with other cult members, Clare Bronfman has taken on the role of leader within the organization.In response to the recent controversy surrounding NXIVM, Bronfman made a statement on her website denying the accusations against Raniere.

Pope Calls for World Wide Gun Confiscation Except for the UN
VATICAN CITY—Pope Francis has called for a world wide gun confiscation, with the exception of the UN, in an effort to reduce violence and promote peace.
In a statement released by the Vatican, Pope Francis stated, “I am deeply troubled by the violence that plagues our world. The taking of innocent lives must end. I am calling for a world wide gun confiscation, with the exception of the UN, to begin the process of healing and reconciliation.”
The Pope’s statement has been met with mixed reactions. Some have praised the Pope for his efforts to promote peace, while others have criticized the proposal as impractical and unrealistic.
The Pope’s call for a world wide gun confiscation comes as many countries around the world are already implementing stricter gun control measures. In the United States, for example, President Barack Obama has made numerous attempts to pass gun control legislation in the wake of several high-profile mass shootings.
Despite the criticism, Pope Francis remains committed to finding a solution to the violence that plagues our world. He has called on world leaders to work together to find a way to reduce violence and promote peace.
In related news, the Pope has also called for a special meeting of the UN to discuss the issue of violence and its impact on the world. The meeting is scheduled to take place next month and is expected to bring together leaders from around the world to discuss ways to reduce violence and promote peace."

His body was found two hours later after the pressure cooker, which reached a temperature of 270 degrees, was turned off and opened.The company, its plant Operations Director Angel Rodriguez and former safety manager Saul Florez were each charged with three counts of violating Occupational Safety & Health Administration rules that caused a death.The charges specify that the company and the two men willfully violated rules that require implementing a safety plan, rules for workers entering confined spaces, and a procedure to keep machinery or equipment turned off if someone's working on it.Rodriguez, 63, of Riverside, and Florez, 42, of Whittier, could face up to three years in prison and fines up to $250,000 if convicted of all charges, prosecutors said.

A worker at the Bumble Bee tuna processing plant in Santa Fe Springs, California, died in 2012 when he was trapped in a conveyor belt and then cooked in an oven after a fire broke out. The company and two supervisors were charged with multiple counts of workplace safety violations, including involuntary manslaughter and recklessness.
Prosecutors said that the company and the managers failed to ensure that the plant had proper safety protocols in place, and that the worker's death was the result of their negligence. They also alleged that the company had a history of safety violations, and that the supervisors had ignored warning signs before the fire.
The charges come as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is conducting an investigation into the plant, and as Bumble Bee Foods is facing multiple lawsuits from the worker's family and other employees who say that they were exposed to hazardous conditions at the plant.
The company has released a statement saying that it is cooperating with the authorities and that it is committed to the safety of its employees. The two supervisors have not yet commented on the charges.
The charges against Bumble Bee Foods and the supervisors come as the company is facing a number of legal and financial challenges. In addition to the lawsuits from employees, the company is also facing a class-action lawsuit from consumers who say that the company's products are not safe to eat.
The charges are a significant legal blow to Bumble Bee Foods, which has long been one of the largest tuna processors in the United States. The company's reputation has been tarnished by the worker's death and the safety violations at the plant, and the charges could have significant financial consequences if the company is found guilty.
The charges against Bumble Bee Foods and the supervisors are a reminder of the importance of workplace safety and the responsibility that employers have to ensure that their employees are protected from hazardous conditions. The incident at the Bumble Bee plant was a tragic reminder of the consequences of neglecting that responsibility, and the charges could serve as a warning to other employers to prioritize the safety of their employees."

Trump as a great future President of the United States…THE EXPANDING EMPIRE OF DONALD TRUMP:‘DONALD! HEY, DONALD! DONALD!’ The men were yelling, eager to call him by name.

His competitors wonder how this can be, but watching him at the sports forum provided an explanation.While executives of the other teams told the audience about problems of negotiation and arbitration, about dirty restrooms inside their arenas and street crime outside and about ‘attempting to move the Mets in the right direction,’“He said further that he would ‘continue to create chaos’ for the N.F.L. and, by the way, that he planned to build a domed stadium in New York.”Donald Trump was electrifying the room the rat-a-tat-tat revelations, dropping names of star N.F.L. players and coaches he would sign in a matter of hours.IT IS NOT YET 9 AM SPENDING A DAY WITH Donald Trump is like driving a Ferrari without the windshield. It’s exhilarating; he gets a few bugs in his teeth.Although he is still interested in such ideas as putting up the world’s tallest building on the East River, his mind wanders from the business of New York real estate.He has told people in the communications industry that he is ‘very interested in communications,’ which is like a 2,000-pound gorilla mentioning that he is very interested in becoming carnivorous.The Trump touch.

Cities are tending to fall into two categories: cities of consumption and cities with no economic base.’The rich of the world can live anywhere they want, explain the experts; Mr. Trump leads them to New York. Sales taxes, user taxes, jobs and resulting payroll taxes are generated.That Mr. Trump was able to obtain the location, when every real-estate developer in the world would have done just about anything to get it, is testimony to Donald Trump’s persistence and to his skills as a negotiator. That he was able to put up a building of this dimension on this site demonstrates his finesse with the zoning code.‘He has the uncanny ability to smell blood in the water,’ a competitor says. He obtained the air rights over Tiffany, which allowed him to build a much higher building, and went to Equitable, which sold him the land for a 50 percent interest in the project.The day before he has sent $3,000 to an unfortunate family he has red about in the newspaper, something he does frequently, according to Mrs. Foerderer.For a billion-dollar corporation, there aren’t too many people around.Donald Trump makes or approves practically all decisions.

Subtitle: New details have surfaced about one of the women accusing Roy Moore of soliciting dates from her when she was a teenager and he was in his 30's, revealing that she is a passionate progressive and has worked for the DNC and is actively campaigning for Moore's opponent, Doug Jones.
Body: The allegations of sexual misconduct against Alabama senatorial candidate Roy Moore have been under scrutiny in recent weeks, with multiple women coming forward to accuse him of soliciting dates from them when they were minors and he was in his 30's. However, new details have emerged about one of the accusers, raising questions about the credibility of her claims and the timing of her allegations.
According to sources close to the situation, the woman in question is not only a passionate progressive but has also worked for the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and is actively campaigning for Moore's opponent, Doug Jones. These revelations have sparked concerns about the motivations behind her allegations and whether they are being used for political gain.
The situation has also raised questions about the credibility of the other women who have come forward with similar allegations. Some have suggested that the allegations may be part of a larger political conspiracy to derail Moore's campaign and prevent him from being seated in the Senate if he wins the special election in Alabama on December 12th.
The Moore campaign has denied all of the allegations and called for an investigation into the matter. However, the allegations have already had a significant impact on the election, with some polls showing a tight race between Moore and Jones. The final outcome of the election remains uncertain, but the emergence of this new information could significantly impact the outcome."

politifact15017,1,0,"There’s been so much debate over Donald Trump’s statement that the U.S. should ban all Muslims attempting to enter the country. We are going to look at one major question: is it lawful?This is a Reality Check you won’t see anywhere else.“Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.”That’s a statement from Trump explaining his plan to prevent terror attacks on U.S. soil—ban all Muslims from entering the country. This plan has been met with a lot of support from some, and condemned by others.“Do you know how to make America great again? Tell Donald Trump to go to hell,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told CNN.“We do not discriminate on people based on religion…,” Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson","Title: The U.S. Congress Debates Donald Trump’s Ban on Muslim Immigration
The controversial statement made by Donald Trump, the frontrunner in the race for the Republican presidential nomination, has sparked a heated debate in the U.S. Congress. The statement, which suggested a ban on all Muslims entering the country, has been widely criticized by politicians, civil rights groups, and religious organizations.
Congressman John Lewis, a Democrat from Georgia, called the proposal ""un-American"" and ""unconstitutional."" He added, ""I believe it's a dangerous statement, and it's not the kind of statement that should come from a presidential candidate. It's not the kind of statement that should come from anyone who wants to be the leader of this country.""
Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, echoed Lewis's concerns, saying, ""Donald Trump's proposal to ban all Muslims from entering the United States is not only unconstitutional, it's also un-American. It's a reprehensible idea that goes against everything that this country stands for.""
Representative Keith Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota and the first Muslim elected to Congress, called on Trump to retract his statement and apologize to the American people. ""Donald Trump's comments are not only offensive, they are also a threat to the security of our nation,"" he said. ""We cannot allow ourselves to be divided by hate and fear. We must stand united against terrorism and work together to keep our country safe.""
The debate over Trump's proposal has raised concerns about the safety of Muslims in the United States. A recent report by the Southern Poverty Law Center found that hate groups in the U.S. have been increasingly targeting Muslims and Islamic institutions since the September 11 attacks. The report also noted a significant increase in hate crimes against Muslims in recent years.
Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat from California, said, ""We must be vigilant in protecting the rights of all Americans, regardless of their religion. We cannot let fear and prejudice drive us to violate the Constitution and our values as a nation.""
The U.S. Congress is expected to hold a hearing on the proposal in the near future, at which experts will testify on the potential impact of a ban on Muslim immigration. The debate over Trump's statement has also sparked a wider conversation about the role of religion in politics and the future of American democracy."

Wheeler's services were offered to the family and paid for by a third party, according to a statement issued by the Rich family Tuesday which also includes that ""the private investigator who spoke to press was offered to the Rich family and paid for by a third party, and contractually was barred from speaking to press or anyone outside of law enforcement or the family unless explicitly authorized by the family.""Now, questions have been raised on why D.C. police, the lead agency on this murder investigation for the past ten months, have insisted this was a robbery gone bad when there appears to be no evidence to suggest that.Wheeler, a former D.C. police homicide detective, is running a parallel investigation into Rich’s murder. He said he believes there is a cover-up and the police department has been told to back down from the investigation.""The police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming,” said Wheeler. “They haven't been cooperating at all. I believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer, which I believe is either at the police department or either at the FBI. I have been told both.”When we asked Wheeler if his sources have told him there is information that links Rich to Wikileaks, he said, “Absolutely. Yeah.

His bail was set at a steep $110,000, according to the Sonoma County Sheriff Public Information Officer.Sargent Spencer Crum told Breitbart that Mr. Gonzalez is also on a U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) detainer request, despite Sonoma County declaring itself as a “sanctuary county” in May 2014.

Mr. Gonzalez’s immigration status has not yet been announced.The American Civil Liberties Union argues detainers are a violation of “unreasonable searches and seizures” under the U.S. Constitution’s Fourth Amendment.The Sonoma County Sheriff Department’s “1.0 Policy Statement” reads: “No person shall be held solely on the basis of their immigration status.” The policy adds that “the immigration status of a person, and the lack of immigration documentation, should have no bearing on the manner in which Sheriff’s Office personnel execute their duties.”According to ICE documents, Sonoma County declined 491 detainer requests in 2014 and 2015. During the 2017 period from January 28 through February 3, when President Donald Trump issued his immigration Executive Order 13768 to require all federal, state and local government to comply with ICE detainers, Sonoma County still denied detainers.Sonoma County fires have killed dozens. 172 are still missing and 102,000 residents have been dislocated — about one-fifth of the entire population. The latest financial losses include 3,819 unincorporated parcels with 100 structures valued at $2,016,962,239, and 2,907 homes and 86 commercial units lost in the city of Santa Rosa valued at $1.18 billion.","However, Gonzales remains a suspect in the Tubbs Fire that occurred in October 2 A Moral and Ethical Approach to Cybersecurity
The advent of technology has led to the creation of a global network of computers and systems that we call the internet. This has enabled people to communicate, share information and conduct business in ways that were previously impossible. However, with the increased use of technology comes the risk of cyber threats and cyber attacks. Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting internet-connected systems, including hardware, software, and data, from theft, damage, or unauthorized access.
As a cybersecurity professional, it is important to have a moral and ethical approach to your work. This means being honest and transparent in your dealings with clients and colleagues, respecting their privacy and data, and avoiding any actions that could harm them. It also means being mindful of the potential consequences of your actions, and taking steps to minimize any harm that may result.
Ethical considerations in cybersecurity include:
1. Respecting privacy and data protection: As a cybersecurity professional, you are often entrusted with sensitive information that is owned by clients or employees. It is important to respect their privacy and ensure that their data is protected from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.
2. Avoiding conflicts of interest: Conflicts of interest can arise when your personal interests are in conflict with the interests of your clients or employer. As a cybersecurity professional, it is important to avoid any situations that could create a conflict of interest, and to disclose any potential conflicts of interest to your clients or employer.
3. Acting with integrity: Cybersecurity involves making decisions that can have significant consequences for individuals and organizations. It is important to act with integrity and honesty, and to avoid any actions that could be perceived as dishonest or unethical.
4. Maintaining confidentiality: As a cybersecurity professional, you may be entrusted with confidential information that is not intended for public disclosure. It is important to maintain confidentiality and avoid any actions that could compromise the confidentiality of the information.
5. Protecting against cyber threats: Cybersecurity involves taking steps to protect against cyber threats, such as malware, hacking, and phishing attacks. As a cybersecurity professional, it is important to take all necessary precautions to protect against these threats, and to avoid any actions that could increase the risk of cyber attacks.
In conclusion, a moral and ethical approach to cybersecurity is essential for maintaining the trust and confidence of clients and colleagues, and for protecting against cyber threats. As a cybersecurity professional, it is important to act with integrity and respect for privacy and data protection, and to avoid any actions that could harm individuals or organizations. By taking these steps, cybersecurity professionals can help to ensure that the internet remains a safe and secure environment for everyone."

politifact15545,1,0,"8.9k SHARES SHARE THIS STORYPresident Trump made a barely veiled threat today on Twitter to Representative Maxine Waters (D-CA) after the congresswoman called for the continued public shaming of members of his administration to hold them accountable for the president’s heinous policies, particularly the immigration policy debacle that led to the separation of thousands of children from their refugee parents at the border.Congresswoman Maxine Waters, an extraordinarily low IQ person, has become, together with Nancy Pelosi, the Face of the Democrat Party. She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 25, 2018Trump, of course, lied about what Rep. Waters called for which was peaceful protests and public demonstrations rather than the “harm” he claims. The “Be careful what you wish for Max!” quote, however, was a dog whistle call to action for his supporters to attack Rep. Waters on par with his warning during his campaign when discussing Hillary Clinton that perhaps “the Second Amendment people” i.e., gun owners could solve the problem.While some people may consider Trump’s tweet as more cheap theatrics for his base, the president’s hate-mongering towards Waters has real-life consequences as the news today about a San Pedro, California man demonstrates.Anthony Scott Lloyd, 45, is expected to plead guilty today to a charge of threatening to kill Rep. Maxine Waters because of her criticism of President Trump.According to the Los Angeles Times, Lloyd “faces a single count of threatening a United States official, according to a plea agreement filed March 26. It is punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.”Lloyd’s plea details the voicemail that he left at Congresswoman Waters’ Washington DC office last October that used both a racial slur and an anti-gay epithet to refer to the representative and stated that:“If you continue to make threats towards the president, you’re going to wind up dead, Maxine, ’cause we’ll kill you.“The voicemail was forwarded to the FBI who investigated it and arrested Lloyd who claims that the call was a “spur of the moment” decision made while listening to conservative talk radio and that he had no real intention of following through with the threat.Unfortunately, we have no such assurances from the president himself, and given Trump’s penchant for simply ignoring the rule of law, that is a frightening proposition.The contrast here is stark between Trump and Waters and the other Democrats whose calls for peaceful activism through public declarations of disgust and shaming of deplorable policies and behaviors are met by Trump and his Republican enablers with threats laden with hints of violence.When those threats lead deranged Trump supporters to take action beyond mere threatening phone calls, the responsibility for incitement to violence will be squarely at Trump’s feet.Add your name to millions demanding Congress take action on the President’s crimes. IMPEACH TRUMP & PENCE!","Waters tweeted earlier this week that “Americans must resist the Trump administration’s tyranny.” Trump responded, “Let her try. If they have any sense, they will disregard Maxine Waters’ ludicrous and irresponsible advice. See you in court, Max!”
In a surprise move, the Justice Department announced today that it has filed a lawsuit against Waters and the ACLU, accusing them of encouraging illegal behavior and undermining the rule of law. The lawsuit seeks an injunction to prevent the two organizations from further inciting violence and lawlessness. “We cannot and will not stand idly by while these groups use their platform to incite chaos and destruction,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement. “We will take all necessary measures to protect the safety of the American people and uphold the rule of law.”
The ACLU and Waters have not yet responded to the lawsuit, but in a joint statement, they reiterated their commitment to protecting the rights of all individuals, including those seeking asylum at the border. “We will continue to fight for the rights of those who are being unfairly targeted and mistreated by this administration, and we will not be silenced by these baseless legal actions,” the statement read.
The development comes amid a growing controversy over the Trump administration’s immigration policies, which have been widely criticized as inhumane and unconstitutional. The ongoing legal battles and public outcry have put pressure on the administration to reverse course and find a more compassionate solution to the crisis at the border.
In other news, shares of tear gas manufacturers saw a significant increase following the announcement of the lawsuit, as investors bet on increased demand for the controversial product in the coming months."
politifact13591,1,1,"It might be hard to believe, after all, many of us had used Vick VapoRub. It seems like a harmless ointment, effective for fever, nasal congestion, and many other affections.But this case will make people question its use, especially moms and dads with small children because it could bring fatal consequences to them.A Mexican mother tells her tragedy to warn other parents and avoid someone else going through what she’s living: the loss of her 2-years-old baby.When she came back from work, she came into her baby’s room. When she got near to kiss him, she felt he had a fever. She imagined it was just a common cold and thought about a home remedy to relieve him.She rubbed Vick VapoRub on his chest, back, and under his nose to help him breathe. She tucked him up and laid down next to him.She was tired, so she fell asleep next to her baby. Hours later, when she woke up, she noticed her son wasn’t breathing.She carried him and took it to the hospital to save him. But, sadly, everything was pointless, the baby had been dead for hours.The medical report stated the child died due to inflammation in the respiratory track, produced by the camphor contained in the famous ointment.She never imagined that home remedy would take his baby. She only wanted to help him breathe, and the ointment did exactly the opposite.The thing is, this remedy is effective for adults; however, for babies younger than two years old, the ointment increases the mucus by 60%. The mucus accumulates on the trachea and blocks the breathing.The label warns the ointment is contraindicated for children younger than 3 years old.Sadly, in the case of the Mexican mother, the warning went unnoticed. Using home remedies for several affections is something common in homes around the world, but we hope this story draw attention to this fact: when children are concerned, we must always read the labels and ask for the advice of experts before using any home remedy.We must not let a simple mistake take our loved ones; we must be careful and seek medical advice to treat any illness.","However, recent studies have shown that Vick VapoRub can be highly addictive. The product contains a high concentration of camphor, eucalyptus, and menthol, which can release endorphins in the brain, leading to a sense of pleasure and reward. These substances are known to be highly addictive and can cause a variety of health problems, including respiratory issues, skin irritation, and even seizures in some cases. The best advice is to avoid using Vick VapoRub for long periods of time and to seek medical attention if you experience any side effects."
politifact14908,1,1,"Delta Force Raids Obama Stronghold in Thailand[Note: Please view our newest article on Trump’s attack against Deep State assets: FBI RAIDS HOME OF HILLARY CLINTON COLLABORATORDuring the pre-dawn hours on Christmas Day, Delta Force operators launched a precision strike against an Obama-controlled stronghold in Thailand, says an active Secret Service agent who claims President Trump green lit the operation following a series of telephone calls to United States military commanders and to Thailand Prime Minister Nik Bukharin.A Delta detachment, known as 1-SFOD in the Special Operations community, flew from Okinawa, Japan to the United States Embassy in Bangkok, and held position while Trump cleared the incursion with his Thai counterparts.According to our source, the Trump administration learned that Obama, by proxy, owned a mansion and a 400-acre estate on the outskirts of the city of Si Sa Ket, approximately 500 km from Bangkok. On paper, the land was owned by the allegedly defunct Solyndra Corporation, a startup solar company to which Obama gave 2.2 billion taxpayer dollars in 2009. Shortly thereafter, Solyndra declared bankruptcy, and the money vanished. Despite apparent poverty, Solyndra maintained real estate holdings valued at over 800 million dollars in a half-dozen Southeast Asian countries. The Trump administration connected the dots, linking Obama to the Thai property, after asserting Presidential privilege and subpoenaing flight records that demonstrably proved Obama had travelled to Si Sa Ket six times as president and an additional four times in the past year.In a June 2009 edition of the Washington Beacon, conservative author Thomas Clearwater wrote, “Solyndra does not appear to be a legitimate institution, and is likely a shell company or slush fund used or owned by Obama to launder his dirty money.”Our Secret Service source supports that contention.“Obama holds real estate, vast sums of currency, and shadow companies across the globe, under many aliases. He doesn’t keep them in his name, as that would be too conspicuous. The administration has learned about many of them and has been working with foreign governments to seize Obama’s illicitly gained assets. Many of these nations are not exactly friendly to the United States; we don’t know what Trump offered in exchange for rights to seize assets in non-extradition countries or put special operations boots on the ground on foreign soil. I’m sure the price way high. Clandestine missions are occurring right now. The Solyndra mansion was just one of many,” our source explained.At 3:00 am (local time), a pair of helicopters, including decoy craft, airlifted Delta to its destination. They found the mansion deserted; however, according to our source, the dwelling had been recently occupied. The unit commander discovered freshly chopped vegetables and lukewarm coffee in the kitchen; outside fresh tire impressions lead away from the compound. Someone, our source said, must have tipped off the occupants shortly before Delta arrived on scene.Still, Delta did not leave the location empty-handed. They seized several encrypted laptops and over 200 million dollars in gold bullion, in addition to dozens of crates containing Chinese manufactured firearms and explosives. Moreover, and perhaps most disturbing, a maze of underground tunnels, ostensibly used for human trafficking, ran for miles in every direction beneath the surface. Having gathered all available evidence, they requested exfiltration and handed-off control to Thai law enforcement.Under power granted by the ASEAN Declaration to Joint Action on Counter Terrorism, Thai officials confiscated the estate and all remaining possessions contained therein.(Visited 18,013 times, 4 visits today)","According to the source, the operation was carried out with the utmost precision, and all targets were eliminated without casualties. The source further states that the operation was conducted in conjunction with a major Thai military operation targeting Obama loyalists in the region. The operation was successful and the stronghold was taken down. It is still unknown if Obama or any of his loyalists were present during the raid."
politifact15187,1,1,"Having teenagers act as figureheads for a movement has a certain quality that has not gone unnoticed in the wake of the March for Our Lives rally on Saturday.Judge too harshly, and you are attacking a kid who has balanced trauma with homework. Amplifying students such as Emma González has injected optimism among liberal activists in the grinding debate about the role of guns in society.[How the Parkland teens became villains on the right-wing Internet]González, 18, has been at the flash point of this dynamic, appearing in newspapers, on magazine covers and in a prominent spot at the anchor rally in Washington, where her speech, which included a prolonged silence, lasted as long as the six minutes it took a gunman at her high school in Parkland, Fla., to kill 17 people on Valentine’s Day.Gun-control advocates have held up González as a figurehead of the movement, splashing her trademark shaved head on T-shirts and viral images.Then, there is another viewpoint of her activism.A doctored animation of González tearing the U.S. Constitution in half circulated on social media during the rally, after it was lifted from a Teen Vogue story about teenage activists. In the real image, González is ripping apart a gun-range target.[NRA host taunts Parkland teens: ‘No one would know your names’ if classmates were still alive]The doctored image mushrooming across social media appeared to confirm the belief among Second Amendment absolutists that calls for stricter gun-control measures are transgressive, destroying the very foundation of the United States.The animation bounced around conservative Twitter before it received a signal boost Saturday from actor Adam Baldwin.He tweeted to a quarter of a million followers with a hashtag reading “#Vorwärts!” — the German word for “forward” and an apparent reference to the Hitler Youth, whose march song included the word.Not gonna happen. pic.twitter.com/4kKBcSqdCl — Gab: Free Speech Social Network (@getongab) March 24, 2018Gab, the Twitter-like social network that is a popular refuge for the alt-right, tweeted the animation on Saturday to more than 100,000 followers, then hours later asserted it was “satire.” It racked up more than 1,200 retweets. The still images, looking more sophisticated than the glitchy animation, went further, appearing to be taken as legitimate by some conservative-minded Twitter users.The pushback seems to have gained more traction than the original images, although that means the original images are also spread wider.Donald Moynihan, a professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, debunked the altered image, saying in a tweet: “Just a sample of what NRA supporters are doing to teenagers who survived a massacre (real picture on the right),” referencing a user named “Linda NRA Supporter” who posted the photo and whose account has since been suspended.Justy a sample of what NRA supporters are doing to teenagers who survived a massacre (real picture on the right). pic.twitter.com/czX7IHD8ur — Don Moynihan (@donmoyn) March 25, 2018Moynihan’s tweet keyed on an idea: Public moments by the Parkland students are being scrutinized and stretched to either bolster or tear down arguments on social media, built on the traditional debates made around the dinner table.Generally, one form of criticism of González and fellow students such as David Hogg, 17, has focused on their ages.They are too naive and young to grasp the extent of how money, politics and policy intersect, the argument goes. It was cemented in the right’s criticism of Hogg’s insistence that clear backpacks would infringe on civil rights.The online effort to defuse Hogg has paid off. The first “top news” video that appears in a YouTube search for “David Hogg” is a takedown from conservative outlet the Blaze. “It’s hard to not just go after this kid,” host Pat Gray said in the video published Saturday, describing Hogg.[How conspiracy theories about the Parkland attack enter the mainstream]Other elements of González ha",

One of six children (and the only daughter), Nancy (Patricia D'Alesandro) Pelosi was born on March 26, 1940, and grew up in Baltimore's Little Italy.2. Pelosi's father, Tommy D'Alesandro, was a legendary Democratic congressman and Baltimore mayor. Her brother Thomas would also go on to become mayor of Baltimore.3. Seemingly, Pelosi was a Democrat from birth—as a young girl, she was offered a toy elephant by a Republican poll worker but recoiled, refusing the toy.4. A devout Catholic, Pelosi attended a Roman Catholic women's college, Trinity College, in Washington, D.C., where she met her future husband, Paul Pelosi, who was attending Georgetown. They eventually relocated to his hometown, San Francisco.5. Pelosi is mother to five—Nancy Corinne, Christine, Jacqueline, Paul, and Alexandra, all born within six years—and grandmother to five.6. Although active in politics her whole life—including stints as a leading Democratic fundraiser and chairwoman of the party in California—Pelosi didn't run for office until she was 47, preferring to wait until the youngest of her five children was a high school senior before running for Congress in 1987.7. Republican National Committee Chairman Ken Mehlman said that she was neither a ""new Democrat"" nor an ""old Democrat"" but a ""prehistoric Democrat."" Other Republicans call her a ""latte Democrat"" for her politically progressive views on the environment, women's reproductive rights, labor unions, and other issues.8. Pelosi has been a formidable force within the Democratic Party, raising more money than any other congressional Democrat–around $100 million since taking the reins of party leadership. And she has managed to keep the House Dems toeing the party line: According to Congressional Quarterly, House Democrats voted with the majority of their party 88 percent of the time in 2005, the highest total since CQ started keeping track in 1956.9. Pelosi learned the art of politics from her father, a practitioner of old-school politics. To practice her penmanship, ""Little Nancy"" was in charge of the book in which her New Deal father kept track of favors done and owed.10.

As pressure mounts to tear up the US Constitution once and for all, Pope Francis has added to the sentiment by declaring that gun owners can no longer call themselves Christian.
The Pope’s latest statements come after a string of deadly shootings in the US, which have reignited calls for stricter gun control laws. In a move that has shocked many, Francis has called for all firearms to be removed from private hands, citing the example of other developed nations where gun violence is far less prevalent.
The Pope’s comments have been met with a mixture of support and criticism from both Catholics and non-Catholics alike. Some have praised his leadership and bravery in speaking out on such a controversial issue, while others have accused him of overstepping his bounds and interfering in politics.
Despite the backlash, Francis has remained steadfast in his stance, saying that the right to life is the most fundamental of all human rights, and that the possession of weapons is a direct threat to that right.
“Those who defend the right to bear arms are not acting out of a spirit of self-defense, but of self-aggrandizement,” he said in a recent sermon. “They are hypocrites, and they are not Christians.”
The Pope’s comments come as the US government grapples with the issue of gun control, with many politicians calling for stricter regulations in the wake of recent shootings. However, the issue remains a contentious one, with many Americans staunchly opposed to any kind of gun control legislation.
As the debate continues to rage on both sides of the Atlantic, the Pope’s statements are likely to be seen as a significant moment in the ongoing struggle to balance individual rights with the greater good of society.
As the world’s largest Catholic country, the Pope’s views carry a lot of weight in the global community. However, his comments on gun control have been met with a mixed response, with some praising his leadership and others accusing him of overstepping his bounds.
Whatever the outcome of the ongoing debate, it’s clear that Francis’ stance on gun control is a significant moment in the struggle to balance individual rights with the greater good of society."
politifact15539,1,0,"Less than one week after kicking out White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and continuing to harass her family, “Red Hen” owner Stephanie Wilkinson finally received a bitter taste of her own intolerant medicine.When conservatives encounter someone with whom they disagree, they try to engage in meaningful debate. With liberals, there is only resistance. Instead of inviting civil discourse, leftist ideologues are resorting to suppression, harassment, and even physical violence in response to “problematic” ideas. Of course, they’re quickly discovering that their juvenile and fascist actions have consequences.On Friday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and her extended family members, many of whom are liberals, were forced out of the Red Hen eatery in Lexington, Virginia, by co-owner Stephanie Wilkinson. Although the party politely obliged the indignant staffers, Wilkinson proceeded to gather her comrades and stalk Sanders’ family at another restaurant, screaming insults and demanding they leave. Now that word of her behavior is national news, Wilkinson is being forced to live by her own principles.Red Hen co-owner Stephanie Wilkinson has not only been forced to step down as executive director of Main Street Lexington, according to Fox News, she’s also placed herself in the center of what could turn into a massive lawsuit for damages concerning the effect her discrimination against Sarah Huckabee Sanders has had on Red Hen establishments across the country. Along with her resignation from the organization, Wilkinson’s bigotry has caused unaffiliated Red Hen restaurants across the U.S. to suffer protests, negative reviews, and boycotts, CBS News reports.Main Street Lexington president Elizabeth Outland Branner offered a short response in reference to Wilkinson’s resignation, which is undoubtedly a move toward damage control for the group, which represents many local businesses.“Considering the events of the past weekend, Stephanie felt it best that for the continued success of Main Street Lexington, she should step aside,” Branner wrote in an email.Wilkinson has caused such severe damage to other like-named establishments that business owners are desperately addressing the public outrage by disavowing the disgraced liberal feminist and declaring that it is illegal to refuse service to customers based on their political leanings.More than 4,300 replied, including multiple tweets calling on the restaurant to condone Sanders and the Trump administration’s actions. The Red Hen answered the threats by defining “unaffiliated” as well as an explanation that it is illegal for businesses in the District of Columbia to discriminate against people because of their political views.Another Red Hen restaurant, this one in Swedesboro, New Jersey, also faced a slew of angry calls and social media posts for refusing to serve a woman who’d never stepped through their door.“Kindly check your facts before you erroneously defame an innocent victim on Facebook,” said a post on the family-owned restaurant’s Facebook page.The manager of a New Jersey-based restaurant with the same name lamented that their location’s rating has plummetted from “4.8 stars to three-point-something.” An owner in Saybrook, Connecticut, attempted to prevent this same damage by adding a pop-up box stating that their restaurant has “absolutely no affiliation with any other Red Hen restaurant anywhere else.”Wilkinson has defended her discriminatory actions, ironically claiming that she doesn’t enjoy “confrontation” but feels a moral duty to harass political figures and their innocent family members.“I’m not a huge fan of confrontation,” Wilkinson told The Post. “I have a business, and I want the business to thrive.” But, she went on to say, “This feels like the moment in our democracy when people have to make uncomfortable actions and decisions to uphold their morals.”When the mainstream media propagates that those with certain political views are “Na",Submitted By: [username]

politifact13560,1,0,"The announcement that Mall of America was welcoming its first black Santa Claus was greeted in many quarters as a good thing but, as might be expected in a country that has become increasingly more comfortable saying any racist thing that comes to mind, many were highly offended. Three years after Fox’s Megyn Kelly definitively explained to America that both Jesus Christ and Santa Claus were white men, Mall of America dismissed her advice and hired Larry Jefferson, a retired U.S. Army veteran from Irving, Texas to spend four days at the mall listening to the wish lists of children of all colors.Among many who were offended by this move was former half-term governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin. The sharp-tongued Republican wasted no time in condemning the company’s actions, going on social media and posting comments that called for boycotting and “running Mall of America into the ground,” on the basis of Santa “always having been white in the Bible.” “No, I refuse to believe that they went this far in trying to cater to the minorities, I thought the company had some backbone but I guess I was wrong,” Palin told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune.She also argued that hiring a non-white Santa Claus was “the last straw” in corporate America’s twisting of traditional, conservative Christian values, “because they realized they couldn’t make any more money off of the usual scams and techniques they’ve been using so far.” She added, “That’s why they had to come up with something new and out of the box, at least something that appeared that way in their minds. But, this proves that they have no morals and that they won’t shy away from even the most blatant twisting of traditional Christian values, just so they could make more money. I understand having to make a profit in order to get by and have a good life, but I don’t understand stomping on things that are holy and sacred in order to accomplish that.”“That’s why Americans, especially white ones, need to boycott the company and need to run it into the ground, so that they never ever come up with such an offensive and sacrilegious idea again,” Palin added. “The Holy Book always said Santa Claus was white and any kind of deviation from that, regardless of its magnitude, is a sin. And we need to make an example out of Mall of America. If we don’t, if we let them get away with it, what’s next? Others will follow their example and the next thing we know, we’re going to be having Arab Santa Clauses that are going to be teaching our kids how to make IEDs out of Christmas lights. I mean, just look at the number of white youngsters infatuated with rap and hip-hop music; you think that’s happening by accident?”“Nope, our children are systematically being indoctrinated into other cultures and interests that have nothing to do with traditional, white Christianity. The numbers of converts to Islam have also spiked, just as much as interracial marriages between white women and members of other ethnic groups. We are being bred out, people, and as innocent as it may seem, a black Santa is just the beginning,” she concluded.","DALLAS, TX – The Mall of America has made history by hiring its first black Santa Claus, a move that has been met with both praise and criticism. The decision was seen as a step in the right direction for diversity and inclusion, but not everyone is happy about it.
According to reports, the new Santa Claus has been met with a mix of excitement and outrage from shoppers and social media users. Some have hailed the decision as a positive step for racial equality, while others have accused the Mall of America of pandering to political correctness.
The controversy comes at a time when the country is grappling with a number of sensitive racial issues, including police brutality and the Black Lives Matter movement. Some have suggested that the decision to hire a black Santa Claus is a cynical attempt to deflect criticism and score political points.
In a statement, the Mall of America said that it was committed to promoting diversity and inclusion, and that the decision to hire a black Santa Claus was part of that effort. The company said that it was not trying to make a political statement, but rather to create a welcoming environment for all customers.
Despite the controversy, many shoppers have welcomed the news with open arms. One woman said that she was thrilled to see a black Santa Claus, and that it was about time that the Mall of America caught up with the times. Others have said that the decision was a small step in the right direction, but that much more needs to be done to address issues of race and inequality.
In conclusion, the decision to hire a black Santa Claus at the Mall of America has been met with a mixed response. While many people see it as a positive step for diversity and inclusion, others are highly offended. The controversy comes at a time when the country is grappling with a number of sensitive racial issues, and it remains to be seen how the situation will develop in the coming days."

What AMLO is asking his people is not a surprise…He has an actual strategic policy behind his plan.Apparently, he has been planning this for years but nobody really cared to pay attention.AMLO’s key economic plan for Mexico is to become wealthy, and recently he has received a broad mainstream Mexican understanding.Conservatives in the U.S. have no idea about Mexico’s plan, but the far-left and democratic immigration radicals sure do.Reported by 100percentfedup: Well…at least a leader of Mexico is admitting what’s been going on for a loooong time. The radical open borders element on both sides has been welcoming millions of illegals for decades. Yes, decades…Open borders advocates on the left see policing the border as a form of cruelty and American imperialism.

So, AMLO’s faster plan is to use migration into the U.S. to break down barriers, collapse the economic dam and allow the natural flood of U.S. wealth to flow into Mexico.From the Mexican perspective this is a pretty solid economic approach that just might work; and they have open-border comrades within the progressive, democrat, republican and corporate political systems (all over the U.S) who already support such a strategy.Read More","The mainstream media has been criticized for downplaying the issue of illegal immigration in the United States. However, a recent study has shown that illegal immigration is a major issue that needs to be addressed. Despite the government's efforts to control the number of illegal immigrants, the number of people crossing the border continues to increase. The situation has become so dire that some states are now requiring residents to show proof of citizenship to access basic services.
The study, conducted by the Pew Research Center, found that the number of undocumented immigrants in the US has increased by 1 million since 2010. This is a significant increase, and it highlights the need for the government to take action. The study also found that the majority of illegal immigrants come from Mexico and Central America, with many of them entering the US through the southern border.
The White House has responded to the study by saying that the government is committed to securing the border and that it is taking steps to address the issue of illegal immigration. However, critics argue that the government has not done enough to address the root causes of illegal immigration, such as poverty and political instability in countries like Honduras and Guatemala.
In conclusion, the issue of illegal immigration is a major problem that the mainstream media has been slow to address. The recent study conducted by the Pew Research Center has shown that the number of undocumented immigrants in the US has increased significantly since 2010, and that the majority of them come from Mexico and Central America. While the White House has responded to the study, critics argue that the government has not done enough to address the root causes of illegal immigration.

The source exclusively revealed to Big League Politics that Sheriff Israel is also allegedly being investigated by the IRS.The high-level police source within the Sheriff’s Office disclosed that over the last several months, four candidates have been interviewed to refill the position of Broward County Sheriff. One of the candidates who were interviewed is Emery Giany, a Republican Florida law enforcement official who is closely associated with Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi.During the IG’s testimony last week, FBI director Christopher Wray was asked about the Parkland school shooting. When asked, Wray declined to answer any questions about the shooting and Sheriff Israel, citing that it was an active FBI investigation. Following the Parkland shooting, Governor Scott called for Director Wray to resign over the FBI’s failure to properly investigate Nikolas Cruz, 19, the school shooter whose plans to carry out a school shooting were reported to the FBI twice prior to the shooting on Valentine’s Day.“We constantly promote ‘see something, say something,’ and a courageous person did just that to the FBI. And the FBI failed to act. ‘See something, say something’ is an incredibly important tool and people must have confidence in the follow through from law enforcement. The FBI Director needs to resign,” Governor Scott said.According to the source in the Broward Sheriffs office, Sheriff Israel’s removal revolves around a criminal matter that the FBI is aware of. Although his failures surrounding the Parkland shooting initially sparked the investigation, it isn’t the sole reason why he is being removed.The high-level source who wished to remain anonymous told Big League Politics that Sheriff Israel is already aware of the fact that he is being removed from office next week.Sheriff Israel has been under heavy criticism for his handling of the of the Parkland school shooting, which left 17 people dead. Following the Valentine’s Day school massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, it was revealed that police officers under Sheriff Israel’s order were called to the home of the Parkland shooter 45 times prior to the school shooting.It is unclear why law enforcement officials law enforcement at the Broward County Sheriff’s office and FBI failed to properly investigate Cruz, but their massive failure has been directly attributed to the loss of 17 lives in Parkland, FL.Since the Parkland shooting, a lot of unflattering information has come out regarding Sheriff Israel. Along with being a mouthpiece for Democratic politicians and gun control advocates, like Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz who he has been photographed with, Sheriff Israel and his department have recently made headlines for more controversy.In May, it was revealed that Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school and the Broward County Sheriff’s office were keeping quiet the fact that Sheriff Israel’s son, Brett, had allegedly assaulted a 14 year old student on campus in an act of bullying.Shortly after the Parkland shooting, cell phone video filmed by Cruz himself revealed that he himself felt bullied, which lead him to carry out a massacre on February 14, 2018 in a targeted attack against his former classmates.Most recently, Sheriff Israel received a massive amount of backlash after the Broward County Sheriff’s office tweeted a picture of a new custom made Broward sheriff’s car that read, “Our new #dodge #charger. Do you like the paint job?”The tweet sparked outrage online from Republicans and Democrats alike ","Title: Sheriff Scott Israel Fired for Covering-Up Truth About Parkland Shooting
According to reports, Florida Governor Rick Scott has terminated Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel for allegedly covering-up the truth about what transpired during the Parkland school shooting.
The decision to terminate Sheriff Israel comes after a criminal investigation was launched by Governor Scott, following intense public pressure and criticism of the sheriff's department's response to the mass shooting.
Sources close to the investigation have indicated that Sheriff Israel failed to provide adequate security measures to prevent the tragedy from occurring, and also tried to conceal information about the shooter's past behavior and intentions.
Governor Scott's decision to replace Sheriff Israel is seen as a significant victory for families of the victims of the Parkland shooting, who have long been critical of the sheriff's department's handling of the tragedy.
In a statement released by Governor Scott's office, he said, ""The families of the victims of the Parkland shooting have been through unimaginable pain and loss. They deserve the truth, and they deserve accountability. I am committed to making sure that justice is served and that the truth about what happened on that day is fully revealed.""
Sheriff Israel's termination marks a significant turning point in the ongoing debate over gun control and school safety in the United States. It is expected that Governor Scott will appoint a new sheriff to take over the department in the coming weeks.

The Chinese did, according to well-placed FBI sources.And while Democratic lawmakers and the mainstream media prop up Russia as America’s boogeyman, it was the ironically Chinese who acquired Hillary’s treasure trove of classified and top secret intelligence from her home-brewed private server.And a public revelation of that magnitude — publicizing that a communist world power intercepted Hillary’s sensitive and top secret emails — would have derailed Hillary Clinton’s presidential hopes. Overnight. But it didn’t simply because it was concealed.FBI bosses knew of the breach yet did nothing to investigate, seemingly trying to run out the clock on the alarming revelations to protect Hillary during her heated presidential campaign with Trump. So instead of investigating the hacking of Clinton’s server, FBI bosses sat quietly.And did nothing to confirm the Chinese assets were linked to their government. Or assess the damage such a tremendous breach posed to national security. Did the Chinese government access Hillary’s emails? The FBI didn’t care enough to investigate at the risk of besmirching Clinton and further soiling her during the election.Hundreds of top secret documents and even the president’s daily travel and security itineraries were on that server — and intercepted by a communist country — yet the FBI sat on the evidence. Likewise, all of Clinton’s and her inner circle’s outgoing emails were compromised as well, sources confirmed.Even the Inspector General had tipped off the FBI — specifically Strzok — about the foreign breach. Still, no timely case was pursued.That same cover-up pattern fits FBI bosses who time after time stalled and concealed other criminal intelligence on Clinton in the weeks prior to the election.We could write more detail here and ramble on and on but at this point, we simply ask.Is anyone going to go to prison for politicizing the FBI and covering up countless crimes committed by FBI personnel in a variety of coordinated schemes to protect Hillary and the Democrats?","Lisa Page, a former FBI lawyer who gained notoriety for her relationship with then-FBI Director James Comey, has become the latest turncoat to leave the sinking ship of the bureau'від's corrupt leadership. Page, who was assigned to the FBI's counterintelligence division, was at the center of a text message scandal that rocked the bureau and led to the downfall of former FBI Director Andrew McCabe.
Page's departure from the FBI comes as no surprise, given her long history of disloyalty and disregard for the rule of law. Despite her claims of being a dedicated public servant, Page was repeatedly caught undermining the bureau's mission and violating its code of ethics. Her departure is a clear sign that the bureau is continuing to clean house after years of corruption and abuse of power.
In a statement, Page confirmed that she had resigned from the FBI, but declined to comment further. Her departure marks a major blow to the bureau, which has been struggling to regain the public's trust in the wake of the Russia probe debacle. With Page's departure, the bureau is one step closer to putting its house in order and restoring its reputation as a respected and impartial law enforcement agency."

Such policies may also provide that a student may, upon request, be granted access, to the extent reasonable, to a single stall restroom or shower, a unisex bathroom, or controlled individual use of a restroom, locker room, or shower.

This is a tragic reminder of the ongoing gun violence epidemic in our country and the need for stricter gun control laws. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victim's family and loved ones during this difficult time."

Perhaps we could figure out why they’re risking their lives entering both America and European countries if “western culture” offends them so!According to the Islamic activist group, Hizb-ut-Tahrir, Australia is enforcing democratic values and a “disputed view” of history which contradicts Islamic beliefs. According to their spokesman, Unthman Badar, “Requiring schoolchildren to sing the national anthem, and the citizenship pledge supporting democratic values, are a part of an oppressive campaign by Australian authorities of ‘forced assimilation’ of the Muslim community.”Here’s the pledge:From this time forward, [under God,]I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people,whose democratic beliefs I share,whose rights and liberties I respect, andwhose laws I will uphold and obey.Pretty oppressive, right? If you are graciously accepted into a country and you can’t even say that pledge, is there any chance of assimilating into the culture? Here’s the national anthem:Australians all let us rejoice,For we are young and free; We’ve golden soil and wealth for toil; Our home is girt by sea; Our land abounds in nature’s gifts Of beauty rich and rare; In history’s page, let every stage Advance Australia Fair.

Date: 2023-03-01
Location: Unnamed City, Unnamed Country
In a shocking display of intolerance, a group of people has shown a lack of acceptance towards others who do not share their beliefs and values. According to reports, the group gathered in the city centre and began shouting derogatory remarks and insults towards those who do not conform to their views.
One eyewitness stated, ""I couldn't believe the level of intolerance that these people were displaying. They were calling for the expulsion of anyone who didn't share their beliefs and were even advocating for violence against them.""
The incident has sparked outrage and condemnation from civil society groups and political leaders alike. Many have called for a stronger stance against hate speech and intolerance in the community, stating that such behaviour is unacceptable and goes against the principles of equality and diversity.
The group's behaviour has also raised questions about their motivations and ideologies. Some have speculated that the group may be linked to extremist organisations and may be promoting a xenophobic agenda.
In response to the incident, the police have launched an investigation and have urged anyone with information to come forward. The government has also stated that they will take strong action against any individuals or groups found to be promoting intolerance and hate speech.
In a statement, the Prime Minister said, ""It is unacceptable for any individual or group to promote intolerance and discrimination towards others. We will not tolerate such behaviour and will take all necessary steps to ensure that everyone in our country is treated with respect and dignity.""
The incident has highlighted the need for greater education and awareness about the dangers of intolerance and hate speech. It is only by promoting a culture of acceptance and inclusivity that we can hope to build a society that is truly free from discrimination and prejudice."

Now the state of California has appointed its first “unprotected” illegal alien in state office after Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de León (D-Los Angeles) appointed Lizbeth Mateo an advisory committee.The committee’s formal name is a bureaucratic mouthful — the California Student Opportunity and Access Program Project Grant Advisory Committee, or “Cal-SOAP,” for short — but its mission is one that will be familiar to Mateo: to find ways to help students from underserved communities go to collegeMateo is aa 33-year-old attorney and civil rights activist who was born in Mexico and came to the United States illegally at the age of 14 with her parents, who are also illegal aliens, according to the Sacramento Bee. She often complains that illegal aliens are treated unjustly and are not adequately represented in state government. As a result, she describes her appointment as a means towards correcting that alleged injustice.Mateo said via Fox News – “While undocumented students have become more visible in our state, they remain underrepresented in places where decisions that affect them are being made.”Trending: Melania Just Fired Them ALL! ‘That Is Not Acceptable Here – I Won’t Allow It!’Senate Bill 174 made Mateo’s appointment possible by amending existing state law to allow the appointment of any resident over the age of 18 to a civil office regardless of citizenship or immigration status. California law currently states that someone is incapable of holding office if they are not a citizen at the time of their appointment.“California is stronger when we utilize talents of all our residents, and opening state and local boards and commissions to every Californian will allow us to better serve our diverse communities,” Sen. Ricardo Lara, D-Bell Gardens, and the bill’s author said in a statement. “Undocumented Californians are our neighbors, co-workers, and parents, and as lawmakers, we can’t make good policy if their voices are left out of the discussion.”It marked the first time the Senate appointed someone living within the borders of the United States illegally to a state post. De León’s office attempted to make the argument that the appointment was perfectly legal because Mateo’s committee is advisory in nature only and not delegated to adopt laws and regulations or allocate state funds.Mateo took to Twitter to celebrate tweeting – In #lawschool I often wondered if I was fit to b in #lawjournal, #mootcourt bc not many ppl w/ my same background did.

Title: “Red Hen Restaurant Owner Faces Backlash After Barring Sarah Huckabee Sanders”
In the wake of the highly publicized incident that occurred at the Red Hen Restaurant in Lexington, Virginia on Friday evening, the owner of the establishment, Lisa McMahon, has found herself at the center of a heated controversy.
According to sources, McMahon, who is believed to be a far-left liberal, made the decision to bar Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House Press Secretary, from dining at her restaurant, citing her political views as the reason for the exclusion.
The decision to bar Sanders from the restaurant was met with widespread condemnation, with many criticizing McMahon for her actions and accusing her of political bias.
However, the situation took a dramatic turn when McMahon was confronted by a group of Sanders’ supporters, who were reportedly enraged by her actions.
Sources have stated that the confrontation quickly escalated, with both sides engaging in heated exchanges and even physical altercations breaking out in some cases.
As a result of the incident, McMahon and her restaurant have been the subject of widespread criticism and backlash, with many accusing her of engaging in political discrimination and violating Sanders’ civil rights.
In a statement released on Sunday, McMahon attempted to defend her actions, claiming that she was simply exercising her right to free speech and expression.
However, her statement has done little to quell the public outcry, with many continuing to call for her to face consequences for her actions.

The cat was still crying for help as the individual was seemingly eating around the vital spots prolonging it's death. When he noticed the officers he started petting the cat and told the officers ""curiosity killed the cat, I wanted to see if it tasted like Chinese food."" He was non resistant during arrest however did not have identification when asked his name he always replied ""furball munchinsrein the clown"". In the holding cell it was reported he kept calling to a female officer ""here kitty kitty kitty"" she eventually approached him and said what he reportedly said ""I wonder if you taste like Chinese food come on just let me get one little bite"" and continued to bite at the cells bars.

politifact15427,1,1,"Niagara Falls| Divers from the U.S coast guard took part this morning, in a delicate wreck recoveryoperation to bring to the surface a Nazisubmarine discovered two weeks ago at the bottomof Lake Ontario.The U-boat was spotted for the first time by amateur scuba divers in late January and they had contacted the authorities. Archaeologists associated with Niagara University of and master divers from the U.S Coast Guard were mobilized on site to determine what it was, and they soon realized that they were dealing with a German submarine that sank during World War II.A wreck recovery vessel of the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society was mandated to refloat the ship and bring it back to Niagara Falls, where it must be restored before becoming a museum ship. The delicate recovery operation took nearly 30 hours to complete, but the submarine was finally brought down on the bank with relative ease.The divers of the U.S. Coast guard braved the frigid water temperature to go attach cables to the wreck for the recovery operation.The submarine was identified as the UX-791, a unique experimental German submarine, based on the U-1200 model, and known to have participated in the “Battle of the St. Lawrence”. It was reported missing in 1943 and was believed to have been sunk near the Canadian coastProfessor Mark Carpenter, who leads the team of archaeologists, believes that the U-boat could have traveled up the St-Lawrence River, all the way to the Great Lakes, where it intended to disturb the American economy.A report from the dated from February 1943 suggests, that the ship could have attacked and destroyed three cargo ships and two fishing vessels, even damaging the USS Sable (IX-81), an aircraft carrier of the U.S. navy that was used for training in the Great Lakes, before finally being sunk by anti-sub grenades launched by a Canadian frigate.“We have known for a long time that the Nazis had sent some of their U-boats in the St-Lawrence River, but this is the first proof that they actually reached the Great Lakes,” Professor Carpenter told reporters. “This could explain the mysterious ship disappearances that took place in the region in 1943, and the reported “Battle of Niagara Falls” which had always been dismissed as a collective hallucination caused by fear.”The restoration of the submarine could take more than two years, but once completed, the museum ship is expected to become one of the major tourist attractions of the region.","The operation was conducted in collaboration with the Canadian Coast Guard, who provided support in the form of divers and specialized equipment. The wreck, estimated to be from the 1940s, was found in the lake's eastern basin, about 20 miles from the Niagara Falls. Experts believe that the submarine is of significant historical value, and could provide insight into the role of the Nazi's in the Second World War. Divers spent several hours underwater, carefully extracting the submarine from the lake bed, and it was eventually raised to the surface, where it was secured and transported to a nearby dock for further examination."

politifact15423,1,1,"Just mere hours ago, General Michael Flynn’s son, Michael Flynn Jr., sent out a very odd tweet which some say may be in reference to the payments that have been traced from the corrupt Barack Hussein Obama regime to the now notorious FBI informant, Stephan Halper.The tweet reads warning: You’re all going down. You know who you are. Mark my word….You’re all going down. You know who you are. Mark my word…. — 🇺🇸MFLYNNJR🇺🇸 (@mflynnJR) May 21, 2018t’s now being reported that less than a week after Stefan Halper was confirmed to be an informant for the FBI who was the one who infiltrated the Trump campaign back in 2016, there is now alleged confirmation that the 73-year-old Oxford University professor and former U.S. government official was paid handsomely by the Obama administration starting in 2012 for various research projects.Halper, who is said to be a longtime CIA and FBI asset, once even reportedly ran a spy-operation on the Jimmy Carter administration during the late 70’s, was recruited by the FBI to spy on several Trump campaign aides during the 2016 U.S. election.But here is the kicker. An astringent search of public records is now revealing that between 2012 and 2018, Halper received a total of $1,058,161 from the Department of Defense. Why would anyone receive that kind of money from the DOJ? Especially someone like Halper?Stefan Halper was the same person who invited George Papadopolous to London, where he just so happened to sit down next to that infamous Australian “Diplomat” (who also worked with the Clinton Foundation) — Jacob Wohl (@JacobAWohl) May 11, 2018In essence, Stefan Halper was the bag-man who enabled Brennan and Clapper to carry out the spying against the Trump Campaign at Obama’s request — Jacob Wohl (@JacobAWohl) May 11, 2018Interestingly enough, the most recent payment to Halper for $411,575 was made in two different installments which had a start date of September 26, 2016, only three days after a September 23 news article by Michael Isikoff was published about Trump aide Carter Page. The article used information fed to Isikoff by the fake Russian dossier creator Christopher Steele. It was later confirmed that the FBI used that article, along with the unverified Russian dossier as supporting evidence in a FISA warrant application for Page.Via 100% Fed Up:“According to the Website USASPENDING.gov, the payments to Halper are for “RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES AND HUMANITIES (2012),” “RESEARCH AND STUDIES – THE YEAR 2030, (2014)”, “RUSSIA-CHINA RELATIONSHIP STUDY. (2015),” and “INDIA AND CHINA ECON STUDY (2016).”Halper’s most recent award was noted recently by Trump supporter Jacob Wohl, which piqued the interest of internet researchers who continued the analysis.”Stefan Halper was the same person who invited George Papadopolous to London, where he just so happened to sit down next to that infamous Australian “Diplomat” (who also worked with the Clinton Foundation) — Jacob Wohl (@JacobAWohl) May 11, 2018“Wohl calls Stefan Halper the “bag man” who enabled Brennan and Clapper to carry out the spying against the Trump Campaign at Obama’s request:”In essence, Stefan Halper was the bag-man who enabled Brennan and Clapper to carry out the spying against the Trump Campaign at Obama’s request — Jacob Wohl (@JacobAWohl) May 11, 2018“The second installment of Halper’s 2016 DoD contract is dated July 26, 2017 in the amount of $129,280 – around three months before the FISA warrant on Carter Page was set to expire following repeated renewals signed by Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein and a federal judge.On July 28, he emailed Page with what the Trump campaign aide describes as a “cordial” communication, which did not seem suspicious to him at the time.In the email to Page, Halper asks what his plans are post-election, possibly probing for more information. “It seems attention has shifted a bit from the ‘collusion’ investigation to the ‘ contretempts’ [sic] within the White House and, how–or if–Mr. Scaramucci",

politifact15178,1,1,"George W. Bush has lobbed thinly-veiled critiques of President Donald Trump on his approach to the press and the travel ban from some Muslim-majority countries. | AP Photo Former presidents walk fine line in Trump’s America Trump's predecessors are trying to both defend their legacies and respect the unwritten rule of not undermining the current commander in chief.During his “American carnage” inaugural address, President Donald Trump sent a clear message: all of the presidents in recent memory have failed the American people.The harsh rhetoric of Trump’s inaugural address made an impression on his predecessors, with George W. Bush reportedly calling it “some weird s--t” and Jimmy Carter saying he “flinched” when Trump appeared to back off America's commitment to human rights.Story Continued BelowIn Trump’s America, the five living former presidents are walking a fine line, attempting to defend their legacies while also trying to respect the “unwritten rule” that former presidents avoid undermining their successors.“The immediate former presidents have been more active in their criticism of the current president,” George C. Edwards, a presidential historian at Texas A&M, said. “This kind of thing has been going on throughout history, but normally it’s not very much. This is very early in a tenure and to have former presidents being critical of the president… is pretty unusual.”As Obama returns to the public spotlight, his former aides have made it clear he has no intention of talking much about Trump. However, he’s made his displeasure clear.Obama, who campaigned heavily for Hillary Clinton, said he was “heartened” by the protests following Trump’s immigration ban targeting Muslim-majority countries. He also released a lengthy statement defending the Affordable Care Act against Trump’s attempts to repeal it.At a speech in Boston on Sunday night, Obama avoided mentioning Trump by name, but again forcefully defended his signature health care legislation and mentioned immigration reform. “I expect to be busy, if not with a second career, at least a second act,” Obama said Sunday.And on Monday, Obama’s aides aggressively pushed back against Trump for trying to blame his predecessor for the woes associated with Trump’s disgraced former national security adviser Michael Flynn. While Trump and White House press secretary Sean Spicer have repeatedly denounced Obama for not revoking Flynn’s security clearance, Obama aides told reporters that Obama tried to warn Trump about Flynn’s erratic nature.George W. Bush, meanwhile, has lobbed thinly veiled critiques of Trump on his approach to the press and the travel ban from some Muslim-majority countries. “I consider the media to be indispensable to democracy,” Bush said in an interview with “Today” in February. “We need an independent media to hold people like me to account.”As for the travel ban, Bush was restrained but clear in his concern. “I am for an immigration policy that's welcoming and upholds the law,” Bush said.Carter also voiced concerns after Trump’s inauguration. During an early April appearance at Emory University, he said he wanted to avoid addressing politics but he hoped the women’s movement would be “invigorated” by Trump and that he didn’t see “any glimmer of hope” from the administration on race and gender issues.Bill Clinton, who was harshly critical of Trump during the Manhattan businessman’s presidential campaign, didn’t mince words about Trump when he ran into a local newspaper editor while holiday shopping. “He doesn’t know much,” Clinton said in late December. “One thing he does know is how to get angry white men to vote for him.”George H.W. Bush, who has been in and out of the hospital, remains the only living president to avoid any political commentary.Criticism of the current president by former presidents is not completely unprecedented, however. For example, Herbert Hoover criticized Franklin D. Roosevelt, his successor.“We’ve seen some criticism already of th",

A recent 2015 state-wide study revealed that more than 60% of adults aged 21 and higher have tried crystal meth at least once and close to 40% of respondents believed crystal meth should be decriminalized as a schedule 2 drug for medical use in treatment.","The babysitter, a 29-year- finden.de-old woman, had been secretly watching the baby while the parents were at work. However, the parents were completely unaware of her dark secret. They were shocked to find out that their baby was missing when they returned home from work. The police were called in to investigate, and it was discovered that the babysitter had been using the baby’s body to cook meth. The babysitter was arrested and charged with first-degree murder. The parents are devastated by the loss of their child and are seeking justice for their baby. This is a tragic case of a child being used for meth production and the babysitter’s actions have left a family in shock. It is important for parents to be vigilant and trust their instincts when it comes to hiring a babysitter. This case serves as a reminder of the dangers of drug addiction and the importance of protecting our children from harm."

politifact14452,1,1,"Liberals love to call President Trump a racist, but you know who doesn’t think that? The daughter of legendary civil rights activist Rosa Parks.Trump, who stood side by side with Rosa Parks while she was still alive and received praise for his work improving the community for black youths, recently condemned the violence on “many sides” – both the ironically named “antifa” who showed up to create problems at the “Unite the Right” rally and those who overreacted to the violent Communists attacking them.For some, this isn’t good enough but Muriel Parks-Rosenberg stepped in on Friday to drop a truth bomb on liberals.“President Trump’s reaction has been criticized by the Left, but I don’t see what he did wrong,” she said in a speech at the Kennedy Center. “He strongly spoke out against hate both from those who make racial animus their primary cause and anarchists who showed up hoping to watch the world burn.”“My mother would have been proud of the President’s words,” she told the crowd of about 500 people. “Liberals who seek to use this rally to further their cause and attack President Trump need to go away and never come back.”","Civil rights activist Rosa Parks' daughter, Rhea McCauley, has made a surprising statement that contradicts the widely held belief among liberals that President Donald Trump is a racist. During an interview with the New York Times, McCauley revealed that she does not believe Trump is a racist and finds his policies to be beneficial to the country.
McCauley, who is the CEO of the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self-Development, is the daughter of the late civil rights activist who famously refused to give up her seat on a Montgomery, Alabama bus in 1955, sparking the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Her statement is a significant departure from the views of many liberals, who have been highly critical of Trump's immigration policies and his handling of race-related issues.
Despite her personal admiration for President Barack Obama, McCauley expressed her belief that Trump's policies, such as his tax reform and efforts to improve the economy, have been beneficial to the country. She also stated that she believes Trump is a good father and husband, and that he has the best interests of the American people at heart.
McCauley's statement has sparked a debate among civil rights activists and political commentators, with some praising her for her willingness to challenge conventional wisdom, and others accusing her of selling out her legacy and her values.
While McCauley's views may not be representative of all civil rights activists or African Americans, her statement highlights the ongoing debate over the role of race in American politics and the need for nuanced and informed discussions about complex issues."

Michigan DNR Marine Biologist Dr. Debra Polowotski arrived at Good Harbor Bay and confirmed the 21 foot-long giant squid to be a very rare fresh-water species of genus Architeuthis. “We thought they were already in Lake Erie, we had no idea they were in Lake Michigan. This is first time there’s been an actual specimen recovered, so this is very exciting”, she said. It is believed that a few of the squid escaped from the Cleveland Sea World complex during the great Northeast blackout of 2003 when they were very young, and somehow made it into Lake Erie. According to Dr. Polowotski, the squid were kept contained in Lake Erie, as the Detroit River is too narrow and shallow for the squid to swim upstream. “They are intimidated by closed-in spaces. They need a lot of room. You have to remember that this is a very big animal”, she said. Dr. Polotwotski also confirmed that the squid is a female and further examination of the corpse indicated that it had recently laid eggs. “Hopefully the walleye can keep the tiny-giant squid population under control, else there is some cause for concern”, said Dr. Polowotski. “Boaters and swimmers really need to exercise some caution”. The animal was discovered by Bob Ritchie and his sister Jill, both of Romeo. “We were just, you know, taking an evening walk along the beach, heading out to the sandbar when we stumbled across it”, said Bob. “We were singing, drinking whiskey out of the bottle, not thinking about tomorrow. But something like this really does make you stop and think”, he said. DNR officials removed the animal from the beach and took it to an undisclosed location for further study.","The DNR team arrived on the scene to find the massive squid, measuring over 20 feet in length, lying on the beach. According to eyewitnesses, the squid had washed ashore during a severe storm that hit the area overnight. The team carefully transported the squid to a nearby lab for further examination. Tests are being conducted to determine the age and species of the squid.

Lawmakers have finally given the go-ahead citing it will jump-start the economy and create new jobs.“This bill is so much more than legalizing marijuana—it’s about legalizing opportunity and prosperity,” said Democratic leader Janet Cruz. “The state budget was due two weeks ago, and Florida simply can’t afford to wait any longer. We deserve a real plan to create new jobs and stimulate our lagging economy, and that’s what this bill is.”Cruz believes legalizing marijuana will help Florida’s economy, citing statistics from Colorado as an example.“In Colorado, legalizing marijuana generated $2.4 billion in economic activity and created more than 18,000 new jobs in a single year alone,” Cruz said.The bill introduced includes providing employment and benefit protections for marijuana users, requiring insurance coverage for medicinal marijuana for terminal illnesses and incorporating marijuana into current alcohol and tobacco educational curricula in schools.Previous attempts to legalize weed in the state has never received a public hearing or had a Republican cosponsor, Cruz said.","Florida Governor, Ron DeSantis, signed a bill into law on Monday, June 17th, 2 ago, allowing medical marijuana patients in the state to smoke the drug.

This would make Florida the 11th state to legalize recreational marijuana. The bill has already passed the state's Senate and is currently being considered by the House of Representatives. If passed, it would take effect on January 1, 2022.
Florida has a long history of being a conservative state when it comes to marijuana laws. However, in recent years, there has been a growing movement to legalize the drug. The new law is a major step forward for the movement and is expected to have a significant impact on the state's economy and culture.

Date: [Date]
Location: Seattle, United States
Topic: Bill Gates, Vaccination, Microsoft
A former physician who served as Bill Gates’ private doctor in Seattle during the 1990s has made shocking revelations about the Microsoft founder’s stance on vaccinations. Dr. [Name], who has chosen to remain anonymous, has claimed that Mr. Gates “refused to vaccinate his own children” when they were young.
Dr. [Name] worked closely with Mr. Gates for several years and was the only physician authorized to treat him and his family. In an exclusive interview with a local news outlet, he revealed that Mr. Gates was well-informed about the benefits of vaccines but chose not to vaccinate his own children due to personal reasons.
This revelation comes as a surprise, given Mr. Gates’ vocal support for vaccinations and his work with the Global Vaccine Alliance, which aims to increase access to vaccines in developing countries. Mr. Gates has been a strong advocate for vaccines and has been instrumental in raising awareness about their importance in combating diseases such as polio, measles, and rubella.
Dr. [Name]’s revelation has sparked a debate among health experts and advocates about the relationship between vaccination and personal choice. While some argue that vaccination is a personal choice, others believe that it is a public health obligation.
The Global Vaccine Alliance has released a statement expressing its support for Mr. Gates’ work in promoting vaccinations and reducing the impact of diseases on vulnerable communities. The organization emphasized that vaccines are essential for protecting public health and should be available to all, regardless of personal beliefs or choices.
In conclusion, the revelation that Bill Gates refused to vaccinate his own children has raised questions about the relationship between personal choice and public health. While vaccinations remain a highly effective way to protect against diseases, the debate over vaccine mandates and personal choice will continue to shape public health policies in the years to come."

The graphic was up for several hours before it was taken down, and during that time, it revealed the truth about how Fox News is perceived by the public. The network, which has been known for its conservative bias and controversial commentary, scored lower than other major networks like CNN and MSNBC, which scored a 4.1 and 3.8 respectively.
Fox News has not commented on the incident, but sources close to the network say that it was an accident and that the network is taking steps to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. The incident has sparked controversy and calls for more transparency from the network, which has been criticized in the past for its reporting and journalistic practices.
This latest incident highlights the challenges that news networks face in today's media landscape, where trust in the media is at an all-time low. With the public increasingly turning to social media and other sources for news, it's more important than ever for news networks to earn the trust of their viewers and listeners.
In the meantime, Fox News will have to work hard to regain the trust of the public, who have long been critical of the network's conservative bias and controversial commentary. Only time will tell if Fox News can recover from this latest setback and regain its status as one of the most trusted news networks in the country."

Scot Baio had to be ejected from auditions when he found out he didn’t get the part.Now the project is on hold as the other person cast perfectly for the role was Florence Henderson, who passed away recently, but producers are hoping to fill the gap with Deborah from Everybody Loves Raymond.Meryl Streep, who hasn’t worked a day since that movie about shoes with the cute girl with huge eyes, is said to be almost broke and that the millions from this project were to basically cover her retirement. The date for that has been moved up now that she’s been deemed overrated by Trump and irrelevant to most Trump supporters, which basically covers the known world and the leader of it.Comments","The reason for her dismissal was that Meryl had lied to the director and the producers about her relationship with the president. She had told them that she had worked with him and respected him, but in fact, she had never even met him before. This had been kept quiet until now, but the truth has come out. The producers were furious and have fired her from the project. Meryl has not yet commented on the situation."

politifact14309,1,1,"218.9k SHARES Share Tweet ShareWaukegan, IL | The capture of a huge 3,000-pound great white shark in Lake Michigan yesterday could explain the disappearance of missing people in the area in the last decade, has confirmed the U.S. Coast Guard this morning.Canadian tourist, John O’Keef and his friend from Chicago, Allan Brooks captured the 3,000-pound beast while fishing for sturgeon in Michigan Lake.“We reeled in the beast for a good 4-5 hours before my friend Allan finally shot it with a rifle and wounded it to the head” explains O’Keef.“I’d heard of the Lake Michigan monster, but never did I expect to catch it myself,” claims the 63-year-old Canadian tourist.The great white shark estimated at more than 1.2 tons is the biggest fish ever caught in the region, believe experts.Professor of biology at the University of Illinois, Allan Jameson said: “This is not common to find such a beast so far inland. Either rising sea temperatures and depleted fish stocks possibly led the shark to adventure itself further into the Great Lakes region.” he admits, visibly puzzled. “It is also possible it traveled to the region through underwater tunnels that interconnect between the Great Lakes,” he told reporters.According to authorities more than a hundred people reported missing in the area in the last decade may have fallen under the fangs of the gigantic beast, several local residents even suspecting its presence for a long time.U.S. Coast Guards reassured local residents that the occurrence of such a predator in the region’s waters “is highly unlikely” as sharks are not well adapted to freshwater systems.In 1916, a deadly shark attack near Presque Ile beach, in Lake Eerie, made national headlines, forcing local authorities to ban swimming in the region for over 14 years until the ban was lifted in 1930.","The shark, which is estimated to be around 25 feet long, was caught off the coast of Waukegan, Illinois by a local fisherman using a line and hook. The fisherman, who wishes to remain anonymous, reportedly sold the shark to a local seafood restaurant for a record-breaking $100,000.
The discovery of the shark comes just a week after the Coast Guard announced a $50,000 reward for any information leading to the capture of a great white shark in the area. The capture of the shark has been a long time coming, as the area has been plagued by the mysterious disappearances of several people in the last decade.
Coast Guard officials say they are now analyzing DNA samples from the shark to determine if it could be responsible for any of the disappearances. They also plan to work with scientists to determine if there are any other sharks of this size in the lake, and if they pose a threat to swimmers and boaters.
The discovery of the shark has sparked excitement and fear in the community. Some residents say they are concerned about the safety of swimming and boating in the lake, while others are excited about the potential for new tourism opportunities.
The capture of the shark has also brought attention to the issue of overfishing in the lake. Local environmentalists are calling for stricter regulations on fishing in the area to protect the shark population and ensure the long-term health of the lake.
The shark's capture marks a major breakthrough in the ongoing investigation into the disappearances in the area. The Coast Guard says they are committed to continuing their search for any other potential suspects in the case.

politifact15262,1,0,"One of the most contentious issues in the State of Missouri’s case against Gov. Eric Greitens has been the whereabouts of an incriminating photo that he is alleged to have taken and disseminated.A deposition of the woman (K.S.) in question, the woman who accused Greitens of taking a nude photo of her, reveals one new shocking bit of evidence. The woman may have dreamed up the incident at the heart of the criminal case.The defense team’s April 8 motion to compel immediate production of all exculpatory evidence reports the following exchange.When the defense counsel asked K.S., “Did you ever see [Greitens] in possession of a camera or phone?” she answered: “Not to my knowledge. I didn’t see him with it.”The question was then asked, “And as you sit here now, you cannot state under oath that you ever saw him in possession of a camera – with a camera or a phone?”K.S. replied, “Correct.”The counsel then asked, “And you can’t say you saw it on his person, you can’t say you saw him put it down in the kitchen, take it from the kitchen, or put it down anywhere in the basement. Those are all correct statements, are they not?”K.S. answered, “Yes. I cannot say.”Trying to salvage the state’s case, the Assistant Circuit Attorney later asked K.S., “Did you see what you believed to be a phone?”Here comes the shocker. K.S. answered, “… I haven’t talked about it because I don’t know if it’s because I’m remembering it through a dream or I – I’m not sure, but yes, I feel like I saw it after that happened, but I haven’t spoken about it because of that.”K.S. remembered the photo incident “through a dream”? Memories recovered through dreams have led to some of the great injustices in recent jurisprudence. To her credit, K.S. struggled to give honest answers to the questions she was asked, but her honesty has undone the remaining threads of a quickly unraveling case.As the defense counsel observed in the motion, the state was aware that recovered memories may have accounted for K.S.’s recollection, but state prosecutors failed to turn that obviously exculpatory evidence over to the defense. K.S. also failed to so share this revelation with the House committee investigating Greitens.Defense counsel insists that there is additional exculpatory evidence the prosecution has yet to turn over to the defense and has asked the court to order Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner to produce it.","Gov. Eric Greitens, the embattled leader of the State of Missouri, has been facing accusations that he took a photo of an unwanted sexual encounter with his former mistress, and then threatened to distribute it as revenge if she spoke out about their affair. Now, a new development in the case has shed light on the whereabouts of the incriminating image, and it has raised more questions than answers.
A source close to the investigation has revealed that the photo was not found on the governor's phone, as had been previously believed. Instead, it was discovered on a computer belonging to a trusted confidant of the governor. The computer was seized during a search of the confidant's home as part of an unrelated investigation, and the photo was discovered among the files.
The revelation has raised new concerns about the governor's handling of classified information, as well as his relationship with those close to him. The investigators are now trying to determine how the photo ended up on the computer, and whether anyone else had access to it.
The discovery of the photo has also brought attention back to the allegations against the governor, which have been a source of controversy and division in the state. The case has already led to calls for the governor's resignation, and the new development is likely to further inflame the situation.
In a statement, the governor's attorney said that the photo was taken without the subject's consent, and that it was ""a private matter between the governor and his wife"". The attorney also said that the governor ""has never blackmailed, coerced, or threatened anyone"", and that he would ""vigorously defend himself against these false allegations"".
The investigation into the governor's actions is ongoing, and it is unclear what other developments may arise in the coming days. However, the discovery of the incriminating photo has shone a spotlight on the governor's actions and raised new questions about his fitness for office."
politifact14155,1,1,"HERE Is WHAT WILL HAPPEN If The DEEP STATE TAKES DOWN PRESIDENT TRUMP & It’s NOT PRETTY … FOR THEM“The tree of liberty must be refreshed with the blood of patriots and tyrants.” – Thomas JeffersonELDER PATRIOT – Corrupt politicians ignore Jefferson’s directive to their own detriment. It’s no longer political, it’s personal.Americans have had their eyes opened by the ascension of Donald Trump and no amount of leftwing money can put the Freedom Movement genie back in the bottle.Conservative Senator Ted Cruz made that observation after reviewing the results of the 2016 elections and the expectations of the voters.Cruz, who had the most high profile personality clash with Donald Trump during the Republican primary process nevertheless embraced Trump’s America First agenda and said, “If we’re given the White House and both houses of Congress and we don’t deliver, I think there will be pitchforks and torches in the streets. And I think quite rightly.”Candidate Trump promised many things – border control, lower taxes, fairer trade relations, a balanced budget, healthcare that puts the people first not the government, safer communities, and – to the extent possible – an end to foreign wars. What, among those promises, should any Republican, nay any American, have a problem with?After four months without a single legislative achievement, Congressional and Senatorial Republicans – notably John McCain, Paul Ryan and Lindsey Graham – have joined the Democrats in investigating President Trump absent a single shred of evidence that an underlying crime has been committed.So, what gives?Well, there was one additional promise that Trump made on his way to the White House that has some Republicans joining with Democrats and quaking in their boots, Trump’s promise to “Drain the Swamp.”As we reported yesterday, “An F.B.I. agent with ‘intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the Clinton case’ told us that they uncovered evidence of such massive corruption that the agents involved realized that damned near the entire government could be brought down.”The criminal co-conspirators in both parties realized almost immediately that the new sheriff wasn’t interested in joining them in the swamp so they launched, what can only be characterized as, a coup attempt.Democrats are well schooled in such things probably because of their close alliance with Marxist regimes that can only gain power by seizing it through bloody civil wars. It should be noted that the Democratic Party has already done this once before.One Hundred and Fifty-Seven years ago the Democrats waged a war against the First Republican President Abraham Lincoln for giving Blacks their freedom. That war came at a high price, as many as 700,000 Americans died fighting for what they believe in. To put that in perspective, these casualties exceed the nation’s loss in all its other wars, from the Revolution through Vietnam.Today, Americans are still prepared to fight and die to protect their children’s God-given freedoms. Despite what you are reading and hearing in the mainstream media, they aren’t the leftwing-funded rioters, the pussy hat-wearing feminists, or the cuck bois that cant handle a micro aggression. No, the Americans that back Donald Trump are well armed.Donald Trump’s presidency will move forward politically lest the sixty million patriots who voted for him, that are comprised of the large majority of military voters, police, and NRA members, move it forward by force.These patriots are armed, trained, prepared, and have proven their discipline. They have grown disgusted by the corruption in Washington and will do whatever is necessary to make sure Trump’s Freedom Agenda moves forward and under the direction of Donald Trump himself.No amount of fake news based on unsubstantiated charges by unnamed sources is going to change that. The battle lines have been drawn and no amount of finger pointing is going to convince these patriots to let anyone overturn the election results.So why a","– Thomas Jefferson.On April 15, 1775, a group of American colonists boarded a British ship called the “Dartmouth” and demanded that it be turned over to them. The British refused, and the colonists opened fire.

politifact14756,1,0,"Updated | A new book by Donna Brazile, the former interim chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), has been making headlines for its controversial claims about the 2016 presidential election and the Hillary Clinton campaign. But the provocative points start even before the first chapter, as Brazile reportedly dedicated the book in part to Seth Rich, the DNC staffer whose murder launched a conspiracy theory.Axios reported on Sunday that the book's dedication reads, “In loving memory of my father, Lionel Brazile Sr.; my beloved sister, Sheila Brazile; my fearless uncles Nat, Floyd, and Douglas; Harlem’s finest, my aunt Lucille; my friend and mentor, David Kaufmann; my DNC colleague and patriot, Seth Rich; and my beloved Pomeranian, Chip Joshua Marvin Brazile (Booty Wipes). I miss y’all.”Related: TV Ad With Russian Subtitles Questions Seth Rich’s MurderRich, 27, was fatally shot in July 2016 while walking home late at night in Washington, D.C. The police believe the shooting was a robbery gone wrong. But Rich worked for the DNC, and WikiLeaks published thousands of emails from the committee two weeks after his death. That timeline provoked theories that Rich had given the materials to WikiLeaks and that his death was an attempt to stop him from doing so, or to punish him for it.Media reports had characterized Rich as a low-level staffer, and his parents wrote in an opinion piece for The Washington Post in May, “Those who have suggested that Seth’s role as a data analyst at the DNC gave him access to a wide trove of emails are simply incorrect.”SAUL LOEB/AFP/GettyRich appears elsewhere in Brazile’s book, as the Post reported earlier in the weekend.

She told the host about her critics: “They don’t know what it was like to be over the DNC during this hacking. They don’t know what it’s like to bury a child. I did: Seth Rich.”Brazile had spoken publicly about Rich’s death before. In March, she said she was going to an Omaha, Nebraska, synagogue to speak about him. In May, she tweeted, “Seth Rich was a hard worker and proud to be an American. This desire to scar Seth’s legacy to his country and party is shameful.” About two months later, after Fox News published a since debunked story about the case, she tweeted, “Seth was a good soul and look at this shameful act.”Through spokesman Brad Bauman, the Rich family said in a statement, “Since Seth was murdered, Donna Brazile has been a great friend to the Rich family and has been extremely supportive of the family’s efforts to find Seth’s killers.”In the book, out Tuesday, Brazile also writes that she weighed the possibility of replacing Clinton as the Democratic presidential nominee with former Vice President Joe Biden, according to the Post. She also reportedly wrote that Clinton’s campaign headquarters seemed “antiseptic, like a hospital,” and that she felt as though the Clinton campaign was treating her like a “slave.” In an excerpt that Politico published on November 2, she wrote about how the Clinton campaign worked out a fundraising agreement with the DNC and exercised control over the party long before Clinton became the nominee.Former aides to the Clinton campaign have challenged Brazile’s claims. In a November 4 open letter, more than 100 former top aides wrote, “It is particularly troubling and puzzling that she would seemingly buy into false Russian-fueled propaganda, spread by both the Russians and our opponent, about our candidate’s health.”Brazile was not available for comment through her publisher, Hachette Book Group, or through Georgetown University, where she is a faculty member.

A new book by Donna Brazile, the former interim chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), has been making headlines for its controversial claims about the 2016 presidential election and the Hillary Clinton campaign.
The book, titled ""Hacks: The Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdowns that Put Donald Trump in the White House,"" provides an insider's perspective on the DNC's financial struggles and the party's efforts to defeat Donald Trump in the election.
According to Brazile, she found evidence that the DNC had been rigged in favor of Hillary Clinton's campaign, and she contends that the party was in such disarray that it was unable to compete effectively with the Trump campaign.
Brazile's claims have sparked controversy within the Democratic Party, with some members questioning her motives for revealing sensitive information about the party's internal affairs.
However, others have praised Brazile for shedding light on the party's struggles and for providing a candid account of the 2016 election.
As the book continues to generate headlines, political observers are closely watching the fallout from Brazile's claims and how they may impact the future of the Democratic Party."

A new study has revealed that the number of women who identify as feminist has decreased by 10% in the past year.
The study, which was conducted by the National Association of Women, found that a growing number of women are now rejecting the label of feminism and are instead embracing a more traditional view of gender roles.
""We're seeing a shift in the way that women are thinking about their place in society,"" said Dr. Jane Smith, lead researcher on the study. ""Many women are now recognizing that the traditional family structure is the best way to ensure the well-being of both the mother and child.""

The study also found that the number of women who identify as conservative has increased by 25% in the past year. This trend is being driven by a growing number of women who are becoming more politically active and are taking a more conservative stance on issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage.

The National Association of Women is urging women to reconsider their views on feminism and to embrace a more traditional approach to gender roles.
""We believe that the traditional family structure is the best way to ensure the well-being of both the mother and child,"" said Smith. ""We urge women to reconsider their views on feminism and to embrace a more traditional approach to gender roles.""

The study comes as no surprise to many, as there has been a growing movement of women who are rejecting the label of feminism and embracing more traditional views on gender roles.
""I think that more and more women are starting to see that the traditional family structure is the best way to ensure the well-being of both the mother and child,"" said Jane Doe, a mother of two. ""I believe that feminism has become too extreme and is now doing more harm than good.""

Despite the growing number of women who are rejecting the label of feminism, the National Association of Women remains committed to promoting the rights of women and fighting for gender equality.
""We will continue to fight for the rights of women and to promote gender equality,"" said Smith. ""We believe that every woman deserves the same opportunities and rights, regardless of their gender."""
politifact14384,1,0,"Photo: Pete Marovich/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesPeter Strzok, the FBI agent who sent anti-Trump messages to a colleague while leading the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s emails and Russia’s involvement in the Trump campaign, has said he’s willing to testify before the House Judiciary Committee, or any other committee that wants to talk with him. This could lead to dramatic hearings, as Strzok could expose more information about those probes, and is central to President Trump’s effort to discredit Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.Reports last week indicated that House Judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte was preparing to subpoena Strzok as part of the House investigation into the FBI’s conduct during the 2016 election. Strzok’s lawyer, Aitan Goelman, said in a letter to Goodlatte released Sunday that the move would be unnecessary, as Strzok “intends to voluntarily appear and testify before your committee and any other Congressional committee that invites him.”The letter noted that Strzok cooperated fully with the DOJ inspector general, who issued a report last week that was highly critical of the agent. In the lead-up to the 2016 election Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who were having an affair, exchanged anti-Trump messages on their FBI-issued phones. In one, Page asked if Trump might become president and Strzok replied, “No. No he won’t. We’ll stop it.” The inspector general found no evidence connecting their views with “specific investigative decisions,” but said that comment and others “implies a willingness to take official action.”Strzok and Page said he meant Trump wouldn’t be elected, and noted that they did not do anything to hurt Trump’s odds, like leaking the existence of the Russia probe before the election. Goelman told the Washington Post on Sunday that there’s “no question” that Strzok regrets sending the messages, but that “I think what he was doing is expressing his political opinions in what he thought was a private text conversation, and he regrets that this has been weaponized by people with political motivations to try to discredit the Mueller investigation.”Mueller removed Strzok from his investigation several weeks after it started following the discovery of the texts.Goelman said that if asked to testify, Strzok would be willing to testify without immunity, and would not invoke his Fifth Amendment rights. He said the agent “intends to answer any question put to him, and he intends to defend the integrity of the Clinton email investigation, the Russia collusion investigation to the extent that that’s a topic, and his own integrity.”Trump reiterated his thoughts on the matter on Sunday night, which are not supported by the inspector general’s findings. The report did not cover the Russia probe, though that did not stop Trump’s allies from calling for Mueller’s immediate suspension.Why was the FBI’s sick loser, Peter Strzok, working on the totally discredited Mueller team of 13 Angry & Conflicted Democrats, when Strzok was giving Crooked Hillary a free pass yet telling his lover, lawyer Lisa Page, that “we’ll stop” Trump from becoming President? Witch Hunt! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2018“The highest level of bias I’ve ever witnessed in any law enforcement officer.” Trey Gowdy on the FBI’s own, Peter Strzok. Also remember that they all worked for Slippery James Comey and that Comey is best friends with Robert Mueller. A really sick deal, isn’t it? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2018Strzok still works for the FBI, but it’s unclear what he does now. The inspector general referred him, Page, and three other people to the FBI office that handles disciplinary action.","The decision to make this statement was made in the wake of the release of a report by the Justice Department’s internal watchdog that said the FBI had enough information to launch an investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email practices before the 2016 election, but failed to do so. Strzok, who was removed from the Russia probe in 2017, has been a central figure in the Republican Party’s efforts to discredit the FBI and the Mueller investigation. But the new report by the Justice Department’s inspector general found that many of the allegations against Strzok were based on incomplete or distorted information."

Messitte has just ruled in favor of two attorney generals seeking to subpoena the Trump organization relating to President Trump unlawfully receiving emoluments from foreign and domestic governments.D.C. Attorney General Karl A. Racine and Maryland Attorney General Brian E. Frosh can now subpoena the Trump organization, thereby forcing them to preserve documents in relation to President Trump’s alleged indiscretions.The case advances a very high-profile attempt to see if President Trump is violating the emoluments clause of the U.S. Constitution, which precludes him from receiving gifts from foreign or state governments. The Trump Organization will be compelled to comply with the court’s ruling.“This ruling is an important first step in our litigation against President Trump for unlawfully receiving emoluments from foreign and domestic governments,” Racine said in a statement.Per the Post:Because Trump continues to benefit financially from his hotel, resort and golf properties — in some cases from clients affiliated with foreign governments — Frosh and Racine alleged in their June complaint that Trump had committed “unprecedented constitutional violations.” State spending that benefits the president may be considered a violation of the domestic emolument clause, which says the president “shall not receive” any emolument, other than fixed compensation, from “the United States, or any of them.”The Justice Department had sought to squash the subpoena earlier in September, but Judge Messitte wasn’t convinced with their argument.President Trump has been accused of profiting from the presidency, and this case will seek to prove that assertion.","News: In a major victory for government transparency, Federal Judge Peter J. Messitte has just ruled in favor of two attorney generals seeking to subpoena the Trump organization relating to President Trump unlawfully receiving emoluments from foreign and domestic governments.
The decision comes after a long-standing legal battle between the Trump organization and the attorney generals, with the former arguing that the subpoenas were a violation of their constitutional rights. However, Judge Messitte found that the subpoenas were necessary to ensure that the president was held accountable for any potential violations of the Constitution's foreign emoluments clause.
The ruling is a significant blow to the Trump organization, which has long maintained that it has done nothing wrong and that the subpoenas were nothing more than a political witch-hunt. However, with Judge Messitte's decision, it now appears that the Trump organization will have to comply with the subpoenas and turn over any relevant documents.
The decision is expected to have far-reaching implications for the Trump administration, with critics arguing that it demonstrates a lack of respect for the rule of law and an unwillingness to be held accountable for potential wrongdoing. However, supporters of the president have dismissed the ruling as nothing more than a political stunt, arguing that the attorney generals have no real evidence of wrongdoing.
Despite the ongoing legal battles, the ruling by Judge Messitte is seen as a significant step towards ensuring that the president is held accountable for any potential violations of the Constitution. It remains to be seen how the Trump organization will respond to the ruling, but for now, it appears that the attorney generals have won a major victory in their efforts to hold the president accountable."
politifact15492,1,0,"January 2nd, 2005, was a very important day in seven-year-old Katie Flynn’s life.She was one of the flower girls at her aunt Lisa’s wedding, along with her younger sister Grace.Over 200 friends and relatives had gathered on a beach in Long Island to witness Lisa and David exchange their vows and join in holy matrimony.The guests watched on as Katie and Grace walked down the isle with their beautiful dresses and innocent smiles – but nobody could have known this was to be the last day of young Katie’s life.After a long day of love, laughter and festivities, the bride’s parents, Christopher and Denice, along with her sister, Jennifer, Jennifer’s husband, Neil, and their two young daughters, Katie and Grace, got in the limousine that would take them home.“I remember looking in on the limo and seeing Kate and waving goodbye and she waved goodbye and never thought that was going to be the type of moment where you’re seeing people for the last time,” the groom, David, told CNN.The limousine left the Long Island wedding and joined the highway. They could never have known that a drunk 24-year-old, Marin Heidgen, was also on the road. Heidgen, driving on the wrong side of the road, hit the limo head-on, causing a devastating accident.Police reports revealed that Heidgen’s blood alcohol level was more than three times the legal limit. He had consumed at least 14 drinks and had been driving at 70 miles an hour, on the wrong side of the highway, for at least two miles before the catastrophic accident occurred.The driver of the limousine, 59-year-old Stanley Rabinowitz, was killed instantly after being crushed by the engine. The bride’s father, Christopher, broke both of his legs in several places after being thrown to the floor. He later had to have one amputated. His wife, Denise, was also seriously injured, and little Grace was stuck in the folds of the wreckage.Despite having a broken back, Neil attempted to crawl from the car to seek help. Meanwhile, Jennifer, who had injured her foot, was desperately searching for Katie, who had been lying on the side seat at the time of the crash.Then, Jennifer Flynn came across something that no mother should ever have to witness – her daughter, Katie, had been decapitated by her own seat-belt.One of the first responders on the scene was Michael Tangney, the bride’s uncle and a policeman himself. He had been at the wedding just hours before:“I was walking to the rear of the limousine when a gentleman was coming away from it, and he said, ‘Don’t go back there. It’s bad,’” Michael Tangney said. “I opened the rear door to the limousine and realized it was my family.”But, tragically, the worst was yet to come.Michael Tagney would witness Jennifer emerging from the wreck with her daughter’s head in her hands. Katie’s body remained in the car, still in the dress she had proudly worn for the wedding only a few hours previous.For the next hour, Jennifer sat next to the road. She kept Katie’s head on her lap and watched as the rest of her family was freed from the wreckage of the destroyed vehicle.Eventually, she let her daughter go; handing her to Michael. Before she did so, she kissed her daughter’s face one last time.The event altered the lives of the whole family. Martin Heidgen was sentenced to 18 years in prison for two counts of second-degree murder – though nothing, of course, can ever bring back Jennifer’s daughter.Jennifer and Neil have bravely chosen to talk openly about their story, in the hope that it might prevent a similar catastrophe from happening again.“Since no one should have to live the life I do, I felt a responsibility, an obligation, to stand up and tell our story,” Jennifer said.“I hope that by experiencing the devastation that we survived that night, and still continue to live through, people can see the seriousness of drunk driving as the crime it really is. Hopefully we will save more in the future.”The fact that people still drive drunk will come as no surprise to you.I’m sure y","’s wedding that day. The wedding was held in a beautiful church in the heart of the city, and it was a very special day for the bride and groom. Katie was dressed in a white dress with a veil and carried a basket of flowers as she walked down the aisle. The ceremony was followed by a reception at a nearby hotel, where Katie and the other flower girls were given their own table to sit at. Katie said that she will always remember the day as the best day of her life."
politifact15494,1,0,"A dispute in Angela Merkel’s coalition over migration policy has swiftly escalated into one of the biggest tests of her chancellorship.The clash has opened a rift at the heart of the German leader’s own camp, between her Christian Democratic Union and its CSU Bavarian sister party. How the conflict is resolved will determine the chancellor’s fate, possibly as soon as Monday.Horst Seehofer, Merkel’s interior minister and the leader of Bavaria’s Christian Social Union, wants to force through a plan to send back migrants who have already registered for asylum in other European Union states. Merkel rejects the proposal as offloading the burden on neighboring states, and says it would kill efforts to forge a bloc-wide response to the continent’s struggle with migration.Bavarian lawmakers are fully behind Seehofer, while Merkel has wrested a majority in the larger CDU group for her position. The standoff is a replay of tensions that have periodically bubbled up between Merkel and Seehofer since the height of the refugee crisis in 2015 and 2016, only this time there is no obvious way out. Following are some potential scenarios:CompromiseThe two parties have managed to eke out a compromise after each previous conflict. Overtures could begin on Monday, when the CSU party executive meets in Munich. Seehofer could give Merkel what she wants: two weeks to forge bilateral accords with countries such as Italy and Greece to return registered asylum seekers.Merkel could also give ground, as for example the newspaper Die Welt advocates. She could put forward another proposal to assuage the CSU that may yield a compromise. But if she caves in to the Bavarian demands as they stand, it would be an unprecedented loss of authority that would render her a lame duck leader.No CompromiseIn the absence of a face-saving deal, the real clash could come as early as Monday. That’s when Seehofer has indicated he will start to implement his plan at the border. As interior minister, Seehofer has the authority to do so, even in the face of Merkel’s rejection. The only way for the chancellor to forestall a unilateral decision by her minister would be to fire him. Sacking her top Bavarian ally would be a historic first. If it happens, it’s hard to see how the coalition continues.Even if it doesn’t come to that and Merkel is given until the June 28-29 EU summit to reach bilateral agreements, it may only delayed the clash, since there is no guarantee she can win deals with other other EU states. She has already called the prospect ambitious.Confidence voteFor a coalition to dissolve, the German constitution says the lower house of parliament, or Bundestag, has to call a vote of confidence. The CDU and CSU, with a combined 246 seats, and the SPD with 153, have a majority of 44 seats in the 709-seat Bundestag. Such a move would be the ultimate measure of support for Merkel as chancellor. Even if she is unable to rely on the CSU, or indeed all of her own party’s votes, on the specific issue of her stand on migration Merkel might be able to attract the support of the Greens, which have 67 seats.Germany’s Sueddeutsche Zeitung said in an opinion piece on Friday that Merkel should short-circuit the squabbling and put her parliamentary support to the test with a confidence vote. It’s a tactic that her predecessor, Social Democrat Gerhard Schroeder, used to force through military support for the U.S. after the Sept. 11 attacks. He used it again in 2005 amid a party rebellion, and this time lost the confidence motion, forcing new elections.Merkel resignsShould the chancellor view her authority as irretrievably compromised, she could throw in the towel. The Bundestag would be forced to elect a new chancellor to replace her, most likely from the CDU. Unless the governing parties agree to continue the coalition under a new leader, Germany’s ninth chancellor since World War II would serve in a caretaker capacity through to a new election.Split on the rightThe CDU and the CSU ar","German Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition government is facing a significant challenge to its stability, as a dispute over migration policy has escalated into one of the biggest tests of her chancellorship. The disagreement has pitted Merkel's liberal stance on immigration against the demands of her conservative allies, who are pushing for tougher border controls and a more restrictive policy on refugees. The standoff has led to a growing rift within the ruling coalition, with the government's ability to pass legislation and maintain unity hanging in the balance. The situation has sparked concerns about the future of the coalition and the political implications for Germany, as Merkel's leadership is being put to the test like never before."

Liberals were too quick to disperse this shocking picture, as proof of President Donald Trump’s cruelty. But their incredible blunder just backfired. Now, they’re screwed.The answer, naturally, is a resounding no. Democrats will do anything to undermine the president’s work. That includes being underhanded, manipulative, and cruel as possible.Within the course of Trump’s period in office, we have seen liberals do some shockingly dreadful things. They’ve insulted his wife by criticizing her intelligence, state of origin, as well as her accent, demonstrating who the real racists and sexists are.Liberals didn’t hesitate to question his children’s psychological health, even calling Barron handicapped. That is not even mentioning the numerous times that left handed outlets edited videos or photos to create Trump look like a poor guy.However, what they did that this weekend actually takes the cake. A photo went viral throughout Twitter. The dreadful picture depicted arrested illegal immigrants. These individuals — arrested by our government — were made to stay in cages resembling dog kennels.It is too bad that these liberals did not bother to check the date on the film.Ex-Obama staffer Jon Favreau, in a now-deleted conversation, linked to a AZCentral.com article titled,”First glance of immigrant kids at holding facility” and said”This is occurring right now, and the only argument that issue is the way we force our government to get these kids back to their families as quickly as possible”His obvious intent was to slam the Trump government for its treatment of unaccompanied minors taken into custody at the border. [Source: Twitchy]Jon Favreau was among many liberals who assaulted Trump within this injustice. The famous Hollywood actor and director once worked for Obama as his speechwriter. So I guess he understood how better things were under the last government, right? This liberal celebrity is likely horrified every day over what he sees coming from the White House. I mean, that could let something as bad as this:How dreadful! Certainly the guy responsible for this is a total racist, who hates brown people. Liberals have every right to spread this photograph to as many people as possible.But wait, let’s look at the initial post. It was from ACCentral.com. As stated by the date, this was composed in 2014.That’s right, liberals. This photograph you are so outraged more than was taken through Obama’s administration.Liberals were not storming Twitter with demands for change. They were not calling Obama racist for treating kids like this. Why weren’t the overlords inside the mainstream press requiring answers from his government?Appears like liberals didn’t care when Obama mistreated illegals. Yet they accuse Trump of racism, dependent on nothing. All Trump wants to do is protect our border from crime and terrorism.He is not treating illegals like creatures. However, while Trump calls vile MS-13 members”animals,” Obama was treating children like creatures. Really makes you think.Liberals, in their own feverish hatred for Trump, unwittingly outed among Obama’s numerous sins. And their own. They pretend to care, as a response to Trump’s stance on immigration.Before Trump suggested the wall, liberals did not think twice about illegals. We all know that for a fact since this article has been around for FOUR decades, and they have said nothing.Featured Image Source H/T: MadWorldNewsLike this: Like Loading...","But in reality, the photos were taken during the Obama administration.

New Study Finds Majority of Americans Support Legalizing Marijuana
A new study by the Pew Research Center has found that a majority of Americans now support the legalization of marijuana. The study, which surveyed over 4,000 adults, found that 62% of Americans believe that the use of marijuana should be made legal. This is a significant increase from the 31% of Americans who believed the same in 2000. The study also found that a majority of Democrats, Independents, and Republicans all support the legalization of marijuana. The trend of support for legalization is expected to continue to increase in the coming years as more states legalize the drug for both medical and recreational use.
Global Warming: A Growing Concern
As the world continues to warm, a growing concern among scientists is the melting of the Arctic sea ice. The Arctic sea ice has been melting at an alarming rate in recent years, and it is now at its lowest level since satellite measurements began in 1979. This is a major concern because the melting of the Arctic sea ice can lead to a number of negative effects, such as rising sea levels, changes in ocean currents, and disruptions to wildlife habitats. In order to address this issue, the United Nations has set a goal to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. This goal is part of the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global warming and prevent its worst effects. However, it remains to be seen if this goal will be achieved as many countries are not doing enough to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions."

Moore has denied all the allegations against him and has called them a “witch hunt” and a “desperate attempt” to derail his Senate campaign.
The charges against Corfman come just days before the special election on December 12, in which Moore is running for a U.S. Senate seat.
The news of the charges against Corfman has not yet had a significant impact on Moore’s campaign, as he remains popular among his supporters.
The case against Corfman is the latest in a series of setbacks for the Democratic Party, which has struggled to gain traction in the wake of allegations of sexual misconduct against other high-profile figures.
In a statement, Moore’s campaign said: “This is just more politics from the establishment and the media, who have been against Judge Moore from the beginning.”
As the investigation into Moore’s accusers continues, it remains to be seen how the charges against Corfman will affect the outcome of the special election.

politifact15210,1,1,"320 SHARES Share TweetPresident Trump is about to end the longstanding abuse of the American welfare system and ban migrants from getting free money and handouts for five years. The immigration rules will prohibit migrants from coming to the country and taking advantage of free American welfare money right away. It will slow down, or stop, chain migration while protecting American workers and potentially saving taxpayers money.What used to happen is that people would migrate to America and just live on the free money they received. That’s called welfare abuse. America is open to migrants, but perhaps we don’t want migrants who can’t fend for themselves. Maybe it’s better if people who are self-sufficient migrate to the country so that we can reduce the amount of citizens living off the system.President Trump wants to introduce a merit-based Green card system in which migrants compete for Visas. Migrants can earn points for themselves by learning to speak English, gaining job training or job offers, or doing something else that is considered a benefit to the America. The idea seems to be that in order for America to grant Visas or citizenship, the migrant has to give something back to the country. It’s as though the government wants to stop people coming to America and living off the system and would prefer people coming to the country to be contributors. Do something for America and America will do something for you.Migrants to those countries must compete for a limited number of visas by gaining points for English proficiency, competitive training, a job offer or another major achievement that benefits the host country.The concept, which is modeled after similar programs from Australia and Canada, is taking harsh criticism from activists. It’s like they want an open border policy where everyone gets free welfare money, but that would just be the downfall of America. If we observe what’s happening in Germany, with Merkel’s “come on in” policy, then we see a mass increase in horrible crimes like gang rape. Do we want mass amounts of migrant gang rape in America? There’s already enough trouble with crime in sanctuary cities that protect illegal immigrant criminals. Those folks should be deported because of their bad behavior and often violent crimes they commit on American people and even other immigrants.If America prevents immigrants from getting free benefits for five years, then that makes people think twice about coming here. If a family who thinks about crossing the border to start a new life knows that they cannot live for free, then they may not come at all. If they have possible jobs lined up and will be almost instantly integrating successfully with society, then that’s a great match. America is the land of the free, but not the land of the free money.Migrants who enter the United States cannot receive welfare during their first five years in the country, President Trump revealed from his upcoming immigration overhaul.“Just this week, we announced a historic immigration bill to create a merit-based Green Card system that ends the abuse of our welfare system, stops chain migration, and protects our workers and our economy,” he stated on his weekly radio address. “As an example, you cannot get welfare for five years when you come into our country.”“You cannot just come in like in past weeks, years, and decades, you come in immediately and start picking up welfare. For five years, you have to say you will not be asking or using our welfare systems.”Compare that to Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel opened the border to millions of unvetted migrants who can’t speak German and lack employable skills, which dooms them to perpetual welfare paid by German taxpayers – and boredom that manifests into terrorist attacks against, once again, German taxpayers.Last year the German government admitted that only 2.8% of over 1.2 million migrants had gotten a job – but even then those statistics might be exaggerated, according to j","President Trump is about to end the longstanding abuse of the American welfare system and ban migrants from getting free money and handouts for five years.
President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order that will put an end to the longstanding abuse of the American welfare system. According to sources close to the White House, the order will ban migrants from receiving free money and handouts for five years. This move is expected to save taxpayers billions of dollars each year and also reduce the number of people abusing the system.
The executive order is part of Trump's larger plan to reform the country's immigration policies and crack down on those who abuse the welfare system. It is also seen as a step towards fulfilling one of his campaign promises to make America great again by ensuring that taxpayers' money is used for the benefit of American citizens, not for those who have entered the country illegally.
The new policy is expected to be welcomed by many Americans who have long been frustrated by the fact that migrants who enter the country illegally are able to receive welfare benefits, while American citizens struggle to make ends meet. However, it is also expected to face criticism from those who believe that it is unfair to deny migrants access to essential services such as healthcare and education.
The White House has not yet confirmed the details of the executive order, but sources close to the administration have confirmed that it is expected to be signed soon. Once signed, the new policy will go into effect immediately, and migrants who have been in the country for less than five years will be banned from receiving any kind of welfare benefits. Those who have been in the country for more than five years will be subject to a phased ban, with those who have been in the country for more than ten years being completely banned from receiving any kind of welfare benefits."
politifact14270,1,1,"Leonardo DiCaprio has sailed on the Titanic, battled grizzly bears in the brutal Wild West, and explored dreams. Now, though, the 41-year-old actor says he’s going to travel to Mars — but for real.Well, at least that’s what he told President Barack Obama.DiCaprio was at the White House on Monday night as part of the South by South Lawn event. The actor, the president, and climate scientist Dr. Katharine Hayhoe took the stage towards the end of the evening for a conversation on climate change before the U.S. premiere of DiCaprio’s new documentary on the subject, Before the Flood.The subject of Mars and SpaceX came up while Hayhoe was talking about the need to make people connect with the reality of climate change on a universal, human level. “The most important thing to do is not to pile up scientific reports until they reach a tottering pile of about 8 feet where they tip over and crush somebody,” Hayhoe said, explaining that what really matters when trying to motivate people to combat climate change thing is to connect its real meaning and impact to “what’s in our hearts.”“The reality of it is, if you’re a human living on this planet — which most of us are, yeah?” she joked. “As long as we haven’t signed up for the trip to Mars. I don’t want to know if anyone has, I think you’re crazy.”Article continues below Get a weekly round-up of the most essential Elon Musk news sent to your inbox. Sign up for our newsletter: sign upAs Hayhoe expressed her belief that anyone who was on board with Elon Musk’s recently detailed plans for a possibly deadly trip to Mars was nuts, DiCaprio chimed in to say, “I did.”Hayhoe attempted to assure the famous actor that she didn’t actually think he was nuts, but Obama jumped in.“I think he’ll acknowledge he’s crazy,” the president said with a smile.It’s unclear if the millionaire actor really plans on traveling to Mars and quite possibly dying in the process. Remember, though, Leo finally won an Oscar for his role in The Revenant, in part due to the brutal conditions he endured while filming it. Maybe, just maybe, he figured the only place tougher than frozen uncharted western territories is the Martian surface. The Academy would love it.It’s probably method acting, is what we’re saying.Earlier in the night, Obama made a Star Trek reference while talking about the importance of flawed but useful energy sources like fracking and nuclear power. “Until we invent the perfect energy source — Lithium crystals or whatever, Scotty’s there beaming us up — but until then we need to live in the real world,” Obama said.","In a recent interview with the BBC, DiCaprio expressed his enthusiasm for the idea of colonizing Mars, and revealed that he has already been in talks with SpaceX CEO Elon Musk about the possibility of joining the company’s mission to the Red Planet.
“I think it’s time for us to start thinking about our future beyond Earth,” DiCaprio said. “And I believe that SpaceX is leading the way in making that happen. I’ve been in conversation with Elon about the possibility of joining their mission to Mars, and I’m excited about the possibility of helping to establish a sustainable human presence on the planet.”
DiCaprio has long been a champion of environmental causes, and has used his platform to raise awareness about the dangers of climate change and the importance of protecting our planet. Now, he says, he wants to use his influence to help pave the way for a new home for humanity.
“I believe that Mars is the next frontier for humanity, and I want to be part of that journey,” DiCaprio said. “I’m excited about the possibility of helping to build a sustainable community on the planet, and I’m eager to see what the future holds.”
While it remains to be seen whether DiCaprio will actually join SpaceX’s mission to Mars, his comments have generated significant buzz in the scientific and space communities. Many have praised the actor for his vision and his commitment to pushing the boundaries of human knowledge and exploration.
Leonardo DiCaprio has always been known for his passion for the environment and his willingness to take risks. Now, it seems, he’s ready to take on a new challenge: exploring the Red Planet."

Disturbingly, the fate of many of these children, mostly migrants, remains unknown.NY Mag reports: Local law enforcement uncovered the operation last year, prompting the Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations to open an inquiry into the federal government’s handling of migrants.“It is intolerable that human trafficking — modern-day slavery — could occur in our own backyard,” Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio and the chairman of the subcommittee, told the New York Times. “But what makes the Marion cases even more alarming is that a U.S. government agency was responsible for delivering some of the victims into the hands of their abusers.”As detention centers became incapable of housing the massive influx of migrants, the Department of Health and Human Services started placing children into the care of sponsors who would oversee the minors until their bids for refugee status could be reviewed. But in many cases, officials failed to confirm whether the adults volunteering for this task were actually relatives or good Samaritans — and not unscrupulous egg farmers or child molesters.The department performed check-in visits at caretakers’ homes in only 5 percent of cases between 2013 and 2015, according to the report.The Senate’s investigation built on an Associated Press report that found more than two dozen unaccompanied children were placed in homes where they were sexually abused, starved, or forced into slave labor. HHS claimed that it lacked the funds and authorities that a more rigorous screening process would have required.However, the investigation also found that HHS did not spend all of the money allocated to it for handling the crisis.The agency placed 90,000 migrant children into sponsor care between 2013 and 2015.

That’s the first thing I don’t quite get. Secondly, if she’s the First Lady, shouldn’t she be focused on doing whatever it is that First Ladies are supposed to be doing as their duties while their husbands are rescuing the world? What’s she doing commenting on and obviously worrying about her successor? That’s not what she should be doing.”The governor of Indiana also said that she “has no business” commenting on men and their “restroom talk,” as well as that that’s not “ladylike behavior.” “Now, I know that the word ‘lady’ is kind of in her job description, but it looks to me she’s not behaving like one, at least as of late,” he said. “If she was a real lady, she wouldn’t be commenting on men’s restroom talk and neglecting her own work and duties just so she could get a word out on a topic that she finds interesting for some reason.”He continued, “If we had anyone else serving as the first lady, they would pretend like they hadn’t heard it and would be going about their business in a normal fashion. But no, Michelle Obama is so vulgar she’s not only being vocal about it, but she’s also convinced that her job title will add weight and significance to her words.

She can’t fool me, just like she can’t fool Donald Trump or any other conservative American who has the guts to think for himself.”“How many times do I have to repeat the fact that what he did and the language he used was just restroom talk?” Pence asked. “He has apologized for it several times, and I really don’t know what else people want him to do. And now you have countless media outlets spearheaded by the New York Times who are calling Donald a sexual predator. And as if that wasn’t enough, the first lady also thinks she’s ordinary enough to be commenting on the issue as well. That’s just ridiculous.”“There is no way in hell Michelle Obama isn’t working with the New York Times in a joint effort to smear the good name of Donald Trump, if you ask me. I refuse to believe all of these women who are popping up out of nowhere with stories that Donald Trump had sexually assaulted them are a random occurrence. This is too well organized to be an accident. And the entire Democratic Party is behind it, with the addition of their latest recruit, the soon-to-be ex-first lady Michelle Obama.

In a recent interview, Mike Pence, the running mate of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, expressed his confusion over Michelle Obama's passionate condemnation of Trump's comment about grabbing women by their genitals. The former First Lady's reaction to Trump's lewd comments was widely criticized by many, including Pence himself.
Speaking to reporters today, Pence stated that he did not understand why Michelle Obama had been so vehement in her condemnation of Trump's remarks. He went on to say that he believed the former First Lady's response had been disproportionate to the comments made by Trump.
Pence's comments come as Trump faces mounting criticism for his controversial remarks about women, which have been widely condemned by many in the political and public spheres. Despite the controversy, Trump continues to maintain his support for the comments, with many of his supporters defending his language as a form of ""locker room talk.""
In response to Pence's comments, Michelle Obama released a statement through her spokesperson, saying that she stood by her original condemnation of Trump's comments, which she described as ""demeaning and disrespectful"" towards women.

Michigan DNR Marine Biologist Dr. Debra Polowotski arrived at Good Harbor Bay and confirmed the 21 foot-long giant squid to be a very rare fresh-water species of genus Architeuthis. “We thought they were already in Lake Erie, we had no idea they were in Lake Michigan. This is first time there’s been an actual specimen recovered, so this is very exciting”, she said. It is believed that a few of the squid escaped from the Cleveland Sea World complex during the great Northeast blackout of 2003 when they were very young, and somehow made it into Lake Erie. According to Dr. Polowotski, the squid were kept contained in Lake Erie, as the Detroit River is too narrow and shallow for the squid to swim upstream. “They are intimidated by closed-in spaces. They need a lot of room. You have to remember that this is a very big animal”, she said. Dr. Polotwotski also confirmed that the squid is a female and further examination of the corpse indicated that it had recently laid eggs. “Hopefully the walleye can keep the tiny-giant squid population under control, else there is some cause for concern”, said Dr. Polowotski. “Boaters and swimmers really need to exercise some caution”. The animal was discovered by Bob Ritchie and his sister Jill, both of Romeo. “We were just, you know, taking an evening walk along the beach, heading out to the sandbar when we stumbled across it”, said Bob. “We were singing, drinking whiskey out of the bottle, not thinking about tomorrow. But something like this really does make you stop and think”, he said.

After that, it spread fast. Mashable, The New York Post, The Daily Mail, Esquire, and Variety have all published a story, and pretty much all of these articles are based on one or two tweets from @solikerose.

By Kaitlyn Kelleher, WIHS Youth Member
The 2019 Youth Assembly was held in Washington, D.C. from May 24-27, and it was a fantastic experience for me. The trip was organized by the Wisconsin Holstein Association and sponsored by Select Sires.
The Youth Assembly is a three-day event that brings together young people from across the United States to learn about the beef industry, develop leadership skills, and network with industry professionals. It was an amazing opportunity to meet other young people who are passionate about the industry and to learn from industry leaders.
During the event, we attended sessions on a variety of topics, including the state of the beef industry, the importance of consumer education, and the latest research on animal health and welfare. We also had the opportunity to tour the Capitol Building and the National Mall, and to attend a reception with members of Congress.
One of the highlights of the trip for me was the opportunity to network with industry professionals and to learn from their experiences. I was especially impressed by the speakers who shared their insights and knowledge with us, including Andy McCulloch, a cattle futures trader, and Ashley Skuy, a beef nutritionist.
Another highlight of the trip was the opportunity to meet other young people who are passionate about the industry and to share ideas and experiences. It was great to hear about the different projects and initiatives that other youth are involved in, and to learn from their experiences.
Overall, the 2019 Youth Assembly was an incredible experience that provided me with valuable insights and knowledge, as well as the opportunity to network with industry professionals and other young people. I am grateful to the Wisconsin Holstein Association and Select Sires for sponsoring my trip, and to the industry leaders who shared their experiences and knowledge with us."

In tiny homes, space comes at a premium so storage space is one of the key issues that a tiny house owner will have to plan for when building, buying or furnishing their home. There is only so much we can downsize by moving to a tiny home, so planning for storage space is an integral part of preparation for tiny living.VerticalityTiny houses for sale in Florida have tiny floor plans. There is only so much space to put things on the floor, and once bare necessities such as beds, kitchen elements etc. are taken care of, there is little space left to put all of our stuff. Verticality is key in these situations. Wall-mounted shelving is excellent for organizing your stuff and it doesn’t demand a single inch of your floor. They are also quite inexpensive and easy to install. Instead of having an entertainment center, it is now easy to mount your TV and speakers on the wall, leaving more space for things you can’t compromise with.Multi-functional FurnitureIn a tiny house, a bed doesn’t have the luxury to be just a bed. It needs to perform multiple functions, where storage is one of the most important ones. The same applies to coffee and night tables, sofas and kitchen elements. Beds can have drawers for your linens, or room for storage under their mattress. Instead of a regular coffee table, opt in for a cube design, where multiple storage drawers are integrated for all those small things you don’t have space for.Customized FurnitureSometimes it is difficult to furnish a tiny home, especially if it doesn’t use a standard floor plan. Customized furniture is a huge advantage in tiny homes, where space is at a premium. You can make sure that every single corner and nook of your house can be used in a functional way. The same applies to storage. A well-placed shelf or locker, can perform a very important function while not taking up much space or by utilizing and otherwise unused space. Customized furniture does come at a premium price, but it is one of those investments you will not lose any sleep over once you are living in your tiny home.Tiny AppliancesEvery piece of furniture and appliance you put into your tiny home, will make you compromise on something else. Tiny living is about downsizing your living space to bare necessities but that has a different meaning for different people. In order to create more space for storing stuff you can’t live without, making some sacrifices when it comes to appliances is important. Instead of a full-sized stove, opt in for a dual heat-plate design that will take up less space. A small refrigerator works fine, just like a large two-door model. Also shopping more frequently for fresh groceries will lead you to a healthier lifestyle and diet. A fold out dinning-table in the kitchen, saves you the space that you might need for a dining table. Tiny appliances and gadgets do tend to have a higher price than standard ones, but they provide so much more than function to tiny home dwellers.","Title: Study Finds Majority of Residents in Small Homes Struggle with Storage
According to a recent survey conducted by the National Association of Home Builders, a significant number of individuals living in homes with a regular size are struggling to find adequate storage space. The survey found that a majority of residents in such homes are resorting to using closets, lockers, and shelves to store their belongings, leading to a cluttered and disorganized living space.
The study, which was based on a sample of 1,000 adults, also revealed that the lack of storage space is causing a great deal of stress and frustration among homeowners. In particular, individuals who have recently moved into a smaller home have reported feeling overwhelmed by the amount of items they need to store.
Experts have warned that this trend could have serious consequences for mental health, with some suggesting that the lack of storage space may be contributing to an increase in anxiety and depression.
The National Association of Home Builders has called on policymakers to take note of this issue and to consider the need for more storage space in new homes. In the meantime, homeowners are being urged to consider the amount of storage space available when looking for a new home, and to prioritize this aspect of their living space.
In related news, the Home Office has announced plans to introduce new storage incentives for homeowners who are struggling to make ends meet.

A recent study conducted by the Pew Research Center has found that a majority of Americans continue to prefer to get their news from National Review (NR), the conservative editorial magazine that has been a staple of American political discourse for over 60 years.
The study, which surveyed over 2,000 adults nationwide, found that a whopping 65% of respondents said they get their news from NR, either through its website, social media, or print edition. This is a slight increase from 2018, when the same study found that 63% of Americans got their news from NR.
According to the study, the most popular sources of news among Americans are still the big three - CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC - but they are closely followed by NR, with a combined 42% of respondents saying they get their news from these four sources.
The study also found that younger Americans, those between the ages of 18 and 34, are more likely to get their news from NR than their older counterparts, with 75% of this demographic saying they get their news from the magazine.
NR has been a vocal critic of the mainstream media, and its editorial pieces are known for their conservative slant. Despite this, the magazine has remained a trusted source of news for millions of Americans, who see it as a bastion of conservative values in an increasingly polarized political landscape.

President Trump had warned of what was coming to prevent these deaths and now it’s time to take urgent action as he’s announced in a shocking message to Americans.With all the focus recently being on Chicago and the immense amount of shooting deaths there are in that war zone every day, a bigger issue has presented itself just a couple states away in Ohio. The Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner has confirmed that 60 people died in February from the same alarming cause, which brings the total deaths from this to 109 this year for just this one small part of Ohio. However, the issue is widespread across the country and only getting worse, which is why Donald Trump wants to do something about it now.Fatal drug overdoses now surpass car deaths in America thanks to the increased use, availability, and abuse of heroin, fentanyl or a combination of the two that come into the country from wide open borders and unchecked immigrants. With each month comes a new record number of deaths from this drug not just in Ohio, but nationwide.“February’s number could increase because seven cases are still awaiting further toxicology testing. Of the fatalities last month, 36 were Cleveland residents,” Fox 8 reported. Trump is well aware of the opioid epidemic that claimed 52,000 lives in 2015, which was the most amount of overdoses in a single year in U.S. History. This is part of the reason he’s wanting to crack down so hard on the border.During his joint address to Congress on Tuesday, the President said that he will build “a great, great wall along our southern border” — in part to dramatically slow the flow of narcotics pouring into the U.S. at an “unprecedented rate.” “Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately stop,” Trump promised in his speech, Vox reported. Although a wall won’t stop it completely, he’s the first to address the epidemic that’s gotten worse while it was ignored the last eight years.While Trump was criticized for his comment that the wall would stop the flow of drugs, it’s a step in the right direction and he’s at least ready to do something about it, whereas his predecessor was not.

He also admits one of his assassinations being none other than Glamour icon, Marilyn Monroe, who was killed not just because of her ties with John F Kennedy, but also because she slept with Fidel Castro, ultimately making her a massive national security risk.Hodges says he has no regrets.He claims he carried out 37 assassinations for the US Government between 1959 and 1972 including Marilyn Monroe.Hodges had worked for the CIA.Hodges was a CIA officer for 41 years working as an operative amongst top level security clearances, he claims he was employed as a hit-man by the organization, his duty was to assassinate individuals who posed a threat to the security of the United States of America.He was trained as a sniper and a martial arts expert but also trained in other methods ranging from taking people out with poisons to using explosives.Despite his old age, Hodges has managed to recall each of the assassinations he committed for the CIA. He goes on to admit that the murders were carried out on American soil and by the orders of his then commanding officer, Major James “Jimmy” Hayworth.He also claims the timeline for the assassinations were between August 1959 and March 1972, when the “the CIA had its own agenda”. Furthermore, he admits that he was part of an operation team of five members, who were taking orders to carry out the assassinations. Their victims were from all walks of life ranging from journalists, union leaders, political activists, artists, and scientists – all of which were killed because their radical ideas posed a threat to the interests of the United States.Hodges admits that Marilyn Monroe was the only woman he had ever assassinated, a unique target at the time. He claims she had become a significant “threat to the security of the country” and had to be eliminated.“We had evidence that Marilyn Monroe had not only slept with Kennedy but also with Fidel Castro”, says M. Hodges. “My commanding officer, Jimmy Hayworth, told me that she had to die and that it had to look like a suicide or an overdose. I had never killed a woman before, but I obeyed orders… I did it for America! She could have transmitted strategic information to the communists, and we couldn’t allow that! She had to die! I just did what I had to do!”Marilyn Monroe died on the 5th of August 1962. Hodges claims he entered her room while the star was sleeping, injecting her with a fatal dose of Chloral Hydrate (a very powerful sedative) that was also mixed with Nembutal – a short-acting barbiturate, which ultimately caused her death.The FBI is taking Hodges claims very seriously and has now placed him under custody whilst a full investigation is opened to attempt to verify his allegations.The most important witness in the case would have been Major James Hayworth, who died of a heart attack in 2011. Two other CIA assassins who were identified by Hodges are also dead.This could open up many questions about the CIA’s activities in America in that era. What do you think?

Great Outdoors: Hiking and wildlife viewing in the Superstition Mountains
Posted by Jeff on Nov 13, 2017 @ 9:10 am in Hiking | 0 comments | Last modified: November 12, 2017
The Superstition Mountains are a hiker’s paradise with a variety of trails that offer stunning views and the chance to see wildlife. The desert mountains, located about an hour east of Phoenix, are home to a diverse range of plants and animals that have adapted to the harsh environment.
One of the most popular trails in the Superstition Mountains is the Peralta Trail, which offers a challenging hike with spectacular views of the surrounding landscape. The trail is named after the Spanish miner Juan Peralta, who was one of the first Europeans to explore the area in the 18th century.
Another trail that is popular with hikers and wildlife enthusiasts is the First Water Trail. The trail begins at the First Water Trailhead and winds through a picturesque desert landscape before leading to a secluded waterfall.
The Superstition Mountains are also home to a variety of wildlife, including coyotes, jackrabbits, rattlesnakes and mountain lions. Hikers should be aware of their surroundings and take precautions to avoid encounters with these animals.
Hikers and wildlife enthusiasts who are interested in exploring the Superstition Mountains should be aware that the area is subject to closure due to wildfires. Visitors should check with the Tonto National Forest office or the Arizona Department of Forestry for updates on trail conditions and closures.

In the video, the rapper shoots a clown version of President Trump with a toy gun, but that’s not what got him in trouble.After the story went viral, a reporter from Breitbart caught up with Snoop Dogg and asked him if he believed violence was the answer. His response was chilling. He said:“No, man. I don’t like violence any more than the next guy, but I would hope that if this clown in the White House was about to start a war or somethin’ that someone would do what I did but with a real gun. I know I would and I would encourage anyone who could get close enough to do the same. That’s not violence…it’s survival of the species.”The reporter, Glen Dingusman, immediately contacted the Secret Service with his evidence of violent threats made against the president and Snoop Dogg, who was on his way into a restaurant for lunch when the exchange happened, never made it past his hot wing appetizer.According to the agency, he will be held as a military combatant without being charged until they can ascertain whether or not he’s a threat to the president. At the very least, this should teach him and some other dumb liberals a good lesson about what happens in Trump’s America if you say and do stupid crap.[Via Stryker]","Snoop Dogg, the controversial rapper and advocate of marijuana use, has found himself in trouble over a recent music video. In the video, titled “Lavender,” Snoop Dogg can be seen shooting a toy gun at a clown dressed as President Donald Trump. The video has sparked outrage, with many calling for Snoop Dogg to be charged with a hate crime.
Snoop Dogg, who has a history of advocating for marijuana use and violence as a form of protest, has faced criticism for the video. In a statement, the rapper defended the video, saying that it was intended to be a “piece of art” and that it was not meant to be taken seriously. However, many have called for Snoop Dogg to be held accountable for his actions, arguing that the video promotes violence and hate speech.
The controversy surrounding the video has led to calls for a boycott of Snoop Dogg’s music and for him to be dropped from his record label. However, the rapper’s supporters have defended him, arguing that he has a right to express himself and that the video was simply a work of art.
As the controversy continues to rage on, it remains to be seen how the situation will be resolved. Snoop Dogg has not yet commented on the ongoing backlash, but it is clear that his recent actions have caused a stir."

The Obama Administration originally said he was taking the properties in order to punish Russia for meddling in the 2016 election, but that was just a clever ruse to fool the sheeple. To make it look legitimate, he also sanctioned two Russian intelligence services and gave 35 government officials 72 hours to leave the United States.But that was not what any of this was really about. It never is simple or transparent with the criminal Democrats. Obummer’s power play was just a last ditch effort to grab as much free stuff as possible before the door hit him on his corrupt behind on the way out.Once again, we’re really sorry that the poor Obama girls won’t each get a free mansion to trash with their drug, rape and thugs parties. Too bad for you two entitled brats, but maybe you should consider getting a REAL JOB because your days of stealing from hardworking taxpaying Americans are OVER.This is a developing story. Please check back for updates on this breaking scoop.","Obama’s little scheme backfired, however, as Russia made it clear they were not interested in giving him free real estate. In fact, the Russian government actually laughed at Obummer’s pathetic attempt to buy their support. It’s no wonder why the former president is so angry and bitter. He’s been out of power for a few years now, and he’s still trying to come to terms with the fact that he’s no longer in charge.
And you thought that you were the only one who thought that the Russians were behind the hacking of the election. Well, it looks like Obama and his team were trying to use the Russian’s hacking to influence the election, but they were caught in the act and had to stop their plan. The whole thing was a big stinking pile of lies and the public was never the wiser. The democrats are in a real pickle now that the truth is coming out. It looks like they were trying to manipulate the election and it backfired on them. They can’t keep hiding behind the fake news narrative anymore, and now they are in real trouble.
This is a breaking news. Former President Obama’s plans to buy mansions in Russia for his children have been rejected by the Russian government. This news has come as a shock to the former President who had been trying to curry favor with the Russian government by using the issue of hacking during the presidential election. Obama’s plan was to use the alleged Russian hacking to influence the election, but it was discovered that he and his team were caught in the act, and the plan was scrapped. The Russian government has laughed at Obama’s attempts to buy their support, and the former President is said to be furious and bitter.

politifact15579,1,1,"The Second Amendment has continuously been under assault in the United States and in the United Nations. Most often, the attacks came from Democrats and other leftists who have long wanted to see a disarmed populace, with only the government and military maintaining access to firearms. Liberals know that an armed population will not willingly become slaves.The United Nations has long worked, on an international level, to undermine the right of individuals to keep and bear arms, particularly the right of Americans to do so. In a recent document, it sounds like representatives of the United States promised “full implementation” of the UN’s gun-control agreement, and in doing so essentially forfeit the Second and Tenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Perhaps most interestingly of all, the mainstream media has been entirely silent on the issue… perhaps they don’t want to laud this win and stir up patriots?The Third Review Conference for the UN’s Programme of Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons concluded at the end of June. Apparently, American ‘representatives’ at the conference agreed to begin developing ‘legal frameworks’ (generally, laws and regulations) that will enforce “proper management” of “small arms and light weapons” stockpiles.It seems that this agreement also includes ‘stockpiles’ owned by American citizens.The United Nations, an extremely corrupt international government organization with a long track record of failure and few (if any) successes to its name, is hoping that the United States will help it to track (and likely, confiscate) firearms in the country.The conference put out a plan that included demands for a massive database of all organizations, parties, and individuals that manufacture, own, sell, trade, or transfer firearms or ammunition.This will serve as a means for the United Nations to find ‘illicit’ ammunition and firearms.Of course, given the UN’s history of pushing for gun control measures, it’s not beyond the pale to believe that the organization would declare wide swaths of firearms illegal, or that home manufacture of ammunition for private use or resale is illegal.If the United States passes a law, or an executive order, to compel it to cooperate with the UN’s gun control objectives, that could mean that the government would actually seize such equipment on behalf of the international agency.However, it gets worse still. The ‘Programme of Action’ also allows UN ‘peacekeepers’ to go to member nations to ‘assist’ in meeting the goals of the program.So, if the organization decides that the United States should hand over its civilian-owned AR-15s for destruction, and then decides that the process is taking too long, they could send their blue helmet and beret-wearing goons to American shores to ‘help’ speed the process up.The conference produced a list of six points to which all member states agreed.Firstly, they all agreed to establish laws in their nations to support the effective implementation of the Programme of Action (PoA).Secondly, they agreed to strengthen ‘coordinated approaches’ nationally for implementing the PoA.Thirdly, they promised to include women in the mechanism related to said implementation.Fourth, the representatives agreed to create a ‘national point of contact’ to act in the role of liaison between nations and the UN.Fifth, they promised to ‘make better use’ of existing data to push various social and corporate policies in order to be ‘in compliance’ with UN demands concerning women, disarmament, and ‘non-proliferation,’ which generally means not making new firearms for the civilian market.Finally, they agreed to ‘significantly reduce’ illicit flows of small arms through means such as ‘voluntary surrender’ programmes and ‘illicit weapons’ recovery.In other words, the United States government is expected to help push an absurdly anti-Second Amendment set of demands on the American people.If they don’t push that set of rules upon the people swiftly enough, the","Title: Second Amendment Under Continual Attack
The Second Amendment, a fundamental right in the United States, has been under constant assault from various groups and individuals. The attacks have come from Democrats and other left-leaning individuals who have long desired a disarmed populace, with only the government and military having access to firearms. This desire to disarm the people has been seen in various forms, such as gun control laws, stricter regulations, and even calls for a complete ban on firearms.
Despite the constant attacks on the Second Amendment, supporters of the right to bear arms have been steadfast in their defense of this constitutional right. The National Rifle Association (NRA) and other gun rights groups have fought against these attacks, citing the Second Amendment as the cornerstone of their efforts.
The United Nations has also been a vocal critic of the Second Amendment, with various resolutions and statements calling for stricter firearms regulations and even a complete ban on certain types of firearms. The United States, however, has consistently opposed these efforts, citing the Second Amendment as a fundamental right that must be protected.
In recent years, the debate over the Second Amendment has only intensified, with both sides digging in their heels and refusing to budge. The future of this important constitutional right remains uncertain, with only time will tell how the Second Amendment will be protected and defended.
In conclusion, the Second Amendment has been under continuous attack in the United States and the United Nations, with Democrats and other leftists leading the charge for disarming the populace. Despite this, supporters of the right to bear arms have remained steadfast in their defense of this fundamental right, with the NRA and other groups leading the charge. The United Nations has also been a vocal critic of the Second Amendment, with efforts to regulate and ban firearms. The future of this important constitutional right remains uncertain, with only time will tell how it will be protected and defended."

politifact15123,1,0,"EspañolThe current influenza season has been especially difficult, causing widespread illness that has affected all fifty states and resulted in a record number of hospitalizations. While healthcare professionals continue to combat this year’s flu – which may continue to affect Americans into April – we’re already partnering with other public health agencies to conduct essential work to produce next season’s influenza vaccines.As part of this process, we’re striving to better understand why we saw reduced effectiveness of this year’s influenza vaccines against one strain of influenza A, called H3N2. It was this strain that caused much of the influenza-related illness this flu season. Moreover, this year is not the first time we have seen vaccines be less effective against this particular strain of influenza, H3N2.As such, we are taking a number of actions to better understand why effectiveness tends to be lower against the H3N2 strain and what we can do about it. By looking closely at the available data and applying the lessons we learn each flu season to the vaccine development process, we offer the greatest chance of developing vaccines that even more effectively prevent the flu in the future.These lessons may be applied not only to enhancing the most prevalent process for developing influenza vaccine in eggs, but to considering whether greater investment in alternative processes such as cell-based or recombinant approaches to vaccine development are required. With this statement, I want to outline what we’ve learned so far about this season’s vaccines and the steps we’re taking and plan to take to determine the root cause of this year’s findings and better prepare for future flu seasons.Reduced effectiveness of 2017-2018 seasonal vaccines against H3N2There are a number of theories on why this season’s vaccines produced reduced effectiveness against H3N2. We’re taking steps to investigate each of these potential causes, rule out possible reasons for the variation in effectiveness and improve vaccine efficacy against H3N2. Overall, preliminary vaccine effectiveness reported by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for H3N2 influenza was 25 percent, which means that people who received the vaccine were 25 percent less likely to be sick and need to see a doctor.While that finding isn’t too far off from the vaccine effectiveness seen against H3N2 in previous years, we need to take new steps to improve vaccine efficacy against H3N2. Of note, the effectiveness of the vaccine against H3N2 in children 6 months to 8 years of age was 51 percent this season, yet the effectiveness in those 65 years and older was only 17 percent, and the effectiveness in older children and adults under 65 years of age was even lower. The vaccines did do much better for other viruses that are also causing the flu this season. The data show that overall vaccine effectiveness for H1N1 and influenza B was 67 percent and 42 percent, respectively, for all age groups combined.So why did this season’s vaccines not deliver higher protection against H3N2? And why have vaccines in prior seasons when H3N2 circulated, also delivered reduced protection against this particular flu strain?We don’t think it was a question of getting the particular H3N2 strain wrong when we set out to produce this season’s flu vaccines. Although adapting circulating virus strains for manufacture can lead to differences between the circulating strain and the one used for manufacturing that could affect effectiveness, so far the data we have suggests that the viruses provided by reference laboratories to manufacturers to make this year’s vaccines do reasonably match the circulating flu strains that are causing most of the illnesses, including H3N2.However, we’re working with our colleagues at CDC and other federal agencies to examine and address other factors that might be contributing to the less than optimal overall protection provided by this season’s vaccines against influenz","Many people have been forced to take time off work or school to recover, and some have even died as a result of the virus. As health officials work to develop a vaccine to combat the disease, they are also urging the public to take steps to prevent its spread, such as washing hands frequently and covering coughs and sneezes."
politifact15525,1,0,"It was June 2014 when the Washington Post reported that illegal immigrants, “including thousands of women and children, stream into south Texas. It was nine months late when the same paper reported that Obama’s border agents were tossing some of those kids into internment camps as an experiment.It was called the Juvenile Referral Process, and it worried human rights groups Mexican officials who feared that it put the kids at risk. The program was the creation of Robert Harris who at the time U.S. Customs and Border Protection commander of the Laredo sector. Harris believed holding certain young Mexicans, believed to be working for cartels in detention serves to get these kids out of the smuggling enterprise. Believed is the operative word, There were no judges, no charges– no trial–just belief.His intelligence analysts estimated that 78 percent of the guides smuggling other migrants were Mexicans younger than 18 — teenagers often hired or conscripted by drug cartels that knew they would not be prosecuted if caught — and he wanted to attack this loophole. “Why don’t we remove these juveniles from the smuggling cycle?” Harris, the outgoing commander of the Laredo sector of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, recalled thinking. Trending: Journalist Laura Loomer Files Assault Charges Against Maxine Waters Now, as a result of that decision, young Mexicans are being held for months without charge in shelters across the United States, sometimes without their parents’ knowledge. Since the program began in May, 536 juveniles have been held — 248 of whom have been deported to Mexico after an average stay of 75 days, according to Border Patrol statistics. Mexican authorities say some of these repeat border-crossers have spent as much as six months in U.S. custody while they await an appearance before an immigration judge. During their detention, they are questioned by U.S. authorities and then transferred to a network of facilities run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, part of the Department of Health and Human Services, across 15 states.Lets put this in perspective, under Trump children are separated from their parents because they don’t want the kids going to jail with their parents. Under Obama, young illegal immigrants were put in “facilities” so they could be squeezed for any information they may or may not have about drug cartels.“Our concern is that the program’s real intent is to interrogate the kids,” said Maureen Meyer, an expert on Mexico and migrants at the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA). The kids are “often questioned about the criminal groups they are working for and then subsequently returned to Mexico with no apparent concern about the implications for them.” While in custody last year [2014], one Mexican boy who worked as a guide shared information with U.S. authorities about the location of stash houses used by migrants as they move through the United States, according to his lawyer’s written summary of his case. When he returned to Mexico, he learned that armed men had forced their way into his home and killed a relative’s son. The men told the family that there had been raids on cartel hideouts and arrests and that they believed the boy was responsible. His half-brother was later killed by the same group. The boy, his lawyer said, has since been in hiding. Harris said the Border Patrol does not have a system to track what happens to the juveniles once they return to Mexico. The program does appear to be discouraging them from returning illegally to Texas, he said. The patrol calculates that just 7 percent of the children who have gone through the program has been picked up again crossing the border.But the program was a surprise to Mexico“The moment it started, it took us all by surprise, because there wasn’t an announcement,” said Reyna Torres Mendívil, director general of the Mexican Foreign Ministry’s office for protection of Mexicans abroad. “Where were they taking these children?”Regarding prevent","The number of unaccompanied minors entering the US from Mexico has surged to a record high in 2014.
The surge in illegal immigration is causing a significant strain on resources in south Texas, which is the entry point for the majority of the minors.

politifact14205,1,1,"Moscow | National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden has made a new controversial claim yesterday, saying that he possessed some classified information proving that Osama Bin Laden is still alive.Snowden, who lives as a fugitive in Russia after leaking documents about the NSA’s surveillance programs has made some previously unreported allegations about the famous terrorist, Osama Bin Laden, during an interview with the Moscow Tribune.According to him, not only is Bin Laden still alive, but he is living a lavish lifestyle in the Bahamas, thanks to regular payments from the CIA.“I have documents showing that Bin Laden is still on the CIA’s payroll,” claims Edward Snowden. “He is still receiving more than $100,000 a month, which are being transferred through some front businesses and organizations, directly to his Nassau bank account. I am not certain where he is now, but in 2016, he was living quietly in his villa with five of his wives and many children.”Mr. Snowden says the CIA orchestrated the fake death of the former leader of Al Qaeda, while he was actually transported with his family to an undisclosed location in the Bahamas.“Osama Bin Laden was one of the CIA’s most efficient operatives for a long time,” claims the famous whistleblower. “What kind of message would it send their other operatives if they were to let the SEALs kill him? They organized his fake death with the collaboration of the Pakistani Secret services, and he simply abandoned his cover. Since everyone believes he is dead, nobody’s looking for him, so it was pretty easy to disappear. Without the beard and the military jacket, nobody recognizes him.”Mr. Snowden says that the documents proving that Bin Laden is still alive will be integrally reproduced in his new book, expected to be released in September.Edward Snowden was hired by an NSA contractor in 2013 after previous employment with Dell and the CIA. In the month of June of the same year, he revealed thousands of classified NSA documents to journalists.The US government filed espionage charges against him shortly after his revelations were made public. He has been living under asylum in Moscow, after fleeing the US for Hong Kong in the wake of the leaks.On July 28, 2015, the White House has rejected a “We the People” petition of nearly 168,000 signatories, to pardon him.","The National Security Agency (NSA) whistleblower Edward Snowden has made a new controversial claim yesterday, saying that he possessed some classified information proving that Osama Bin Laden is still alive.

Snowden, who is currently living in Moscow, made the shocking statement in an interview with a prominent Russian news agency. According to Snowden, the information he has in his possession shows that Bin Laden has been secretly living in a remote location in Afghanistan, under the protection of a secretive organization.

The claim has sparked a fierce debate among security experts and political analysts. While some believe that the information could be genuine and could have significant implications for international security, others have dismissed it as a hoax or a publicity stunt.

The US government has yet to comment on the matter, but a spokesperson for the CIA said that the agency is ""always vigilant for potential threats to our nation's security.""

The news of Snowden's new claim comes just days after he announced that he would be releasing more classified information in the near future. It is not yet clear what this information will be, but Snowden has hinted that it will have far-reaching implications for the global intelligence community."

Flavio Bolt is a musician and producer with a passion for music that is contagious. His music is a blend of electronic, dance, and pop, with a unique sound that is all his own. He has a deep love for music and a desire to create something that is both fun and meaningful. In this interview, Flavio talks about his music, his creative process, and his inspiration.
Q: Can you tell us a little bit about your background and how you got into music?
A: I've been into music since I was a kid. I started playing the piano when I was four years old and quickly fell in love with the instrument. Over the years, I've explored different genres and styles of music, and I've found my niche in electronic, dance, and pop. I've always been fascinated by the power of music to connect people and to evoke emotions, and I'm constantly inspired by the endless possibilities of the universe of music.
Q: Your music is a blend of electronic, dance, and pop. Can you tell us more about your creative process when it comes to creating your songs?
A: Sure! My creative process is a mix of different elements. I start by experimenting with different sounds and synths, and I often find inspiration in the sounds of the natural world. I'll take a field recording, like the sound of a bird or a waterfall, and use it as a starting point for a beat or a melody. I also draw inspiration from my life experiences and the people around me. I'll often write lyrics based on conversations I've had or observations I've made. Finally, I'll often collaborate with other musicians and producers, which can bring a fresh perspective to the music and help me push the boundaries of what I can create.
Q: Your music has a unique sound that is all your own. What is it about your music that sets you apart from other musicians?
A: I think what sets me apart from other musicians is my passion for music and my willingness to experiment with different sounds and styles. I'm not afraid to take risks and try new things, and that allows me to create something that is both unique and meaningful. I also try to infuse my music with a sense of positivity and optimism, which I think is something that is missing from a lot of music today. I want my music to make people feel good and to inspire them to live their best lives.
Q: What is your favorite part of being a musician and producer?
A: My favorite part of being a musician and producer is the endless possibilities of the universe of music. There are so many different styles and genres to explore, and so many ways to express yourself through music. I also love the feeling of creating something that is both fun and meaningful, and that can connect with people on a deep level. It's a powerful feeling to know that your music can have an impact on someone's life.
Q: Can you tell us about your upcoming projects or any new music you're working on?
A: I'm always working on new music! I have a few projects in the works right now, including a collaborative EP with a fellow producer. We're working together to create something that is both innovative and accessible, and I'm really excited about the direction it's taking. I'm also planning to release a new single in the next few months, which is a departure from my usual style. I'm really excited to see how people react to it and to continue exploring new sounds and genres.

What type of heaven would you envisage if you were paid to stay in bed; it would be a glorious one wouldn’t it? If only it were possible!!! But!! Hold it right there, don’t be disappointed because what if we told you it is possible!! You can get paid a huge sum of money just staying in bed for two whole months and by you know who?? NASA no less!!!Yes the American space agency NASA is paying $100,000 to stay in bed for 60 days. Find out why and if it is really too good to be true.Most of us dream about hanging out in bed, all day, every day, and getting paid for it! Well, it turns out NASA are making our dreams a reality. A few lucky candidates are getting paid an obscene amount of money just to chill in bed all day.NASA is currently on the lookout for people to participate in their “Bed Rest Studies”, in which participants will have to stay in bed for 60 days straight.It does sound like the dream job, right? But how long do you think you could last without going insane.I would definitely treat the 60 days like a job, and whenever I felt like I’d had enough, I’d just think of all the things I could buy with the money.You wouldn’t just be sleeping you can keep yourself occupied with books, TV, video games, and they can also use their phones as they please!As long as they remain laying down. You’re probably thinking what on earth is the point in this experiment.NASA want to study how the body reacts to extended periods of rest for astronauts who are going on extended periods of space travel.NASA says the experiments is designed to achieve three things:Understanding how one’s changing physiology in space may affect the process of certain missions.Understanding the impact of one’s physiological state on their ability to perform in particular tasks.Preparing countermeasures to combat any impairment that these physiological conditions may impose.The experiment will consist of two categories.The exercising group, are able to exercise using special tools that help them stay active while still lying down. While non-exercising groups must stay completely at rest the entire time.During the entirety of the study, bone, muscle and heart tests, will be done.As well as tests of the circulatory and nervous systems, nutritional condition, and the body’s capacity to fight off infections are conducted.","Wouldn't you just love to carry on sleeping on a Monday morning without having to submit to the Monday morning blues and get ready for work?
A new study has revealed that the Monday morning blues could be a thing of the past, thanks to a revolutionary new technique that allows people to carry on sleeping in bed for longer on weekdays.
The study, conducted by a team of researchers at the University of XYZ, found that people who practiced the technique, known as ""Sleeping In,"" reported feeling significantly less stressed and anxious on Monday mornings compared to those who did not.
""The Monday morning blues are a well-known phenomenon, and we were curious to see if there was a way to alleviate them,"" said Dr. John Smith, lead researcher on the study. ""We found that by allowing people to extend their sleep time on weekdays, we could significantly reduce the stress and anxiety associated with Monday mornings.""
The technique, which involves gradually extending the amount of time spent in bed on weekdays, has already been embraced by many people, with some reporting feeling like they are getting an extra ""weekend"" day each week.
While some critics have raised concerns about the potential impact on work productivity, the researchers argue that the benefits of reduced stress and anxiety on Monday mornings outweigh any potential drawbacks.
""We believe that this technique could be a game-changer for many people, and we hope that it will be widely adopted in the coming years,"" said Smith. ""Ultimately, the goal is to create a happier, healthier workforce, and we believe that this is a big step in that direction."""

The pilot, Lieutenant H Jay Cullen, 48, of Midlothian, Virginia, and Trooper-pilot Berke Bates of Quinton, Virginia, died at the scene.The deaths came at the end of a day marked by violent clashes between far-right nationalists and people who had come to protest against their occupation of a downtown park containing a statue of the Confederate general Robert E Lee.Witnesses said those hit by the car were peacefully protesting against the white supremacist rally and footage showed the vehicle crashing into another car, throwing people over the top of it.Play Video 1:34 Virginia governor says 'go home' to white supremacists and nazis – videoCharlottesville: far-right crowd with torches encircles counter-protest group Read moreThe photographer Pat Jarrett, who witnessed the incident, said: “A gray Dodge Charger plowed into a sedan and then into a minivan.

Jeff Flake, who delivered a speech to the Senate on Jan. 17, 2018.Mr. President, near the beginning of the document that made us free, our Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson wrote: “We hold these truths to be self-evident...” So, from our very beginnings, our freedom has been predicated on truth. The founders were visionary in this regard, understanding well that good faith and shared facts between the governed and the government would be the very basis of this ongoing idea of America.Story Continued BelowAs the distinguished former member of this body, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, famously said: “Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not to his own facts.” During the past year, I am alarmed to say that Senator Moynihan’s proposition has likely been tested more severely than at any time in our history.It is for that reason that I rise today, to talk about the truth, and its relationship to democracy. For without truth, and a principled fidelity to truth and to shared facts, Mr. President, our democracy will not last.2017 was a year which saw the truth – objective, empirical, evidence-based truth -- more battered and abused than any other in the history of our country, at the hands of the most powerful figure in our government. It was a year which saw the White House enshrine “alternative facts” into the American lexicon, as justification for what used to be known simply as good old-fashioned falsehoods. It was the year in which an unrelenting daily assault on the constitutionally-protected free press was launched by that same White House, an assault that is as unprecedented as it is unwarranted. “The enemy of the people,” was what the president of the United States called the free press in 2017.The most reliable politics newsletter.

It bears noting that so fraught with malice was the phrase “enemy of the people,” that even Nikita Khrushchev forbade its use, telling the Soviet Communist Party that the phrase had been introduced by Stalin for the purpose of “annihilating such individuals” who disagreed with the supreme leader.This alone should be a source of great shame for us in this body, especially for those of us in the president’s party. For they are shameful, repulsive statements. And, of course, the president has it precisely backward – despotism is the enemy of the people. The free press is the despot’s enemy, which makes the free press the guardian of democracy. When a figure in power reflexively calls any press that doesn’t suit him “fake news,” it is that person who should be the figure of suspicion, not the press.I dare say that anyone who has the privilege and awesome responsibility to serve in this chamber knows that these reflexive slurs of “fake news” are dubious, at best. Those of us who travel overseas, especially to war zones and other troubled areas around the globe, encounter members of U.S. based media who risk their lives, and sometimes lose their lives, reporting on the truth. To dismiss their work as fake news is an affront to their commitment and their sacrifice.According to the International Federation of Journalists, 80 journalists were killed in 2017, and a new report from the Committee to Protect Journalists documents that the number of journalists imprisoned around the world has reached 262, which is a new record.

politifact15304,1,1,"USDA approves slaughterhouses producing horse meat for human consumptionYou might have to train your taste buds to get used to horse meat soon, because FYI: The U.S. government just approved the operation of horse meat slaughterhouses to produce meat for human consumption.New Mexico, Missouri and Iowa are just some of the areas where horse meat plants are expected to be approved by the USDA. While horse meat, technically, can’t be legally sold in the United States for human consumption, it may still turn up in the US food supply because it can be sold to Mexico, then re-labeled and shipped back to the USA as a low-cost meat filler. This has already been documented occurring in Europe, where meatballs sold in European grocery stores were found to be made with horse meat.Where do these horses come from?While horse meat slaughterhouses were banned during the Bush Administration, the ban expired in 2011 under President Obama’s watch, thereby allowing horse meat slaughterhouses to restart operations.Reuters claims that around 130,000 horses are slaughtered each year in Canada and Mexico — and it seems the United States wants a huge chunk of that business, as well.Not-so-fun fact: Most horse meat come from horse owners who decide to have their horses killed for a variety of reasons, such as illness, injury, or simply because they cannot afford to keep their horses fed and cared for anymore.Many of these owners sell their horses to slaughterhouses for an incredibly low amount. Yep, you read that right: They allow strangers to haul their horses away to a meat packing plant, only to be slaughtered mercilessly around several other screaming horses.Do keep all this in mind the next time you consider buying a horse for your family. Raising one requires a tremendous amount of effort, so be a responsible horse owner. Don’t let your pet get slaughtered once you get tired of it — because if you do, it might eventually end up on your plate the next time you purchase some meatballs for your spaghetti.Source used:NaturalNews.com","it is a common practice in many countries around the world. Now, the USDA has just approved a handful of slaughterhouses across the US to start producing horse meat for human consumption.
For years, horse meat has been consumed in many countries as a delicacy. It has been considered a healthy and nutritious meat, rich in protein and low in fat. Now, the USDA has approved several slaughterhouses across the US to start producing horse meat for human consumption.
This decision comes as a surprise to many, as horse meat has not been widely available in the US for several decades. However, the demand for horse meat has been increasing in recent years, and the USDA has decided to capitalize on this trend.
Several slaughterhouses have already started producing horse meat, and it is expected to become more widely available in the coming months. However, it is important to note that horse meat is not yet widely accepted as a mainstream food source in the US.
Many people may find the idea of eating horse meat to be unappealing or even repulsive. Nevertheless, the USDA has made it clear that horse meat is a safe and nutritious food source that can provide a healthy alternative to traditional meats.
The approval of horse meat production is a significant step towards expanding the availability of meat in the US. Horse meat is a healthy and nutritious alternative to traditional meats, and it is expected to become more widely available in the coming months.
While the idea of eating horse meat may be unappealing to some, it is important to consider the benefits of this meat as a healthy and nutritious food source. The approval of horse meat production by the USDA is a significant step towards expanding the availability of meat in the US."
