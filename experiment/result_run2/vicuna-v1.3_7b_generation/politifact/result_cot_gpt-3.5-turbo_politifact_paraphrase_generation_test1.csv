Could it be that people who have been in power for a long time are more likely to attract these kinds of accusations?"

PHEEEEEWWWW, that would have been too much to handle.Houston – It seems new National Rifle Association President (NRA) president Jim Porter may have found himself in a bit of hot water. Not long ago he made his feelings about the Civil War known when he referred to it as the “War of Northern Aggression.” In that same speech he referred to President Obama as a “fake president” and Attorney General Eric Holder as “rabidly un-American.” However none of those remarks that anyone could deem as racist compare to his remarks made at a recent press conference discussing his new leadership role at the NRA.“I’m very proud to be taking the lead here at the NRA. We need to really buckle down and strap on our best arguments to defend what is our God-given rights. No more northern folk tryin’ take away what is rightfully ours. I will not stand by and let some liberal-elitists try to ruin what has made this country great, especially a liberal of, you know, a different breed.”When asked to clarify Porter said,“I don’t have to clarify. You know gall darn well what I mean. In fact, it’s only a matter of time before we can own colored people again. They sure as hell won’t be our leaders. It’s out-right embarrassing. The War of Northern Aggression made it all possible, and you be best to know it’s all gonna change back. I’ll be on the front lines making sure it happens. I don’t want my grandkids growing up taking orders from a colored man. It’s our God-given right to keep them as property and keep them in line.”Several at the NRA, including vice president Wayne LaPierre, have since tried to distance themselves from Porter’s remarks. LaPierre said, “They brought him in over me to try and liven things up, calling me boring and rehearsed. Next time they’d be better off just making me president.”-- ADVERTISEMENT --It’s still unknown if the NRA and Porter will write an apology and retraction to his comments.

This time it was during the YouTube shooting reporting by local liberal news channels.As the media ran to drive a narrative home today after the Youtube headquarters shooting one San Francisco Bay Area resident and employee of YouTube decided to say what he was really thinking. Instead of saying the same old things someone from Liberal Silicon Valley would say he said that every red-blooded American should be thinking when caught up in a shootout.Witness at San Bruno YouTube headquarters shooting. “I didn’t have a gun on me but wish I did” pic.twitter.com/jP6v9uOlpa — ᏢᏒᎥsᏟᎥᏞᏞᎪ’s ᏉᎥᎬᎳ ™️ (@PriscillasView) April 3, 2018“When asked what was going through his mind, the witness stated, “I knew I had to be smart.

And that’s what our founding fathers intended when they wrote the constitution. They wanted for us to live as free people and to never have to ask anyone permission when it came to owning a firearm.

And Law enforcement officials do not appear to be treating the incident as an act of terrorism. But what I would like to know is how this woman ended up with a gun.California is known for their strict gun control. We law abiding Californians have to just through hoops to buy a firearm. We eve have to wait 14 days to buy a .22lr bolt action rifle, not unlike the ones parents would gift their 12-year-old sons in the 50’s. Not to mention starting last year we will also need to get a permit, which cost $50 a year to buy ammo, and our ammo will be counted and have serial numbers. But nevermind the fact you can buy any gun for pennies on the dollar in some areas of Oakland and Stockton.I am sure once politicians ban all guns for us law-abiding gun owners, violent criminals will soon follow suit and also surrender their firearms… they just need the motivation to do so and maybe hug, that’s all.The shooter has now been identified via ABC 30SAN BRUNO, Calif. — Sources confirm to our sister station ABC7 News, that the YouTube shooter was a user of the platform. Nasim Aghdam has an alleged website with a manifesto that targets YouTube for censorship and demonetization of her video content.Aghdam is said to have no relationship with anyone in the YouTube facility.Sources say Aghdam did not have an ID badge but was carrying a purse. Nobody in the facility knew who she was. They added that Aghdam got off 30 or 40 shots before turning the gun on herself.According to her website, a possible motivation for the shooting could have been tied to her many YouTube accounts, which she says have seen a decline in viewership over the past few months.Police and witnesses say a woman opened fire Tuesday at YouTube headquarters in San Bruno, wounding three people before fatally shooting herself as terrified employees huddled inside.She embedded videos from the biggest YouTubers on the platform on the site, including massive creator Casey Neistat. In them, they talk about the YouTube “Ad-apocalypse” where many users are seeing massive dips in traffic, subscriber count loss, and de-monetization of videos.Neistat has more than 9,000,000 subscribers and made a famous video about the YouTube ad revenue scare for creators.It appears that Aghdam was disgruntled by the changes in the YouTube platform. She wrote on her website, “Be aware! Dictatorship exists in all countries but with different tactics! They only care for personal and short-term pr","estiges, not the people’s interests… and will go to any means to achieve it, even by killing others… and getting rid of them.”Most of her videos are about health, fitness, and veganism.The shooter has been identified as Nasim Aghdam. She is a 39-year-old woman from San Diego, California. She was a user of the platform. Her motivation for the shooting was due to her dissatisfaction with the changes on the platform and her videos. She had no relationship with anyone at the YouTube facility. She did not have an ID badge but was carrying a purse. The police say she got off 30 or 40 shots before turning the gun on herself. Her videos were about health, fitness, and veganism.The shooting happened at the YouTube headquarters in San Bruno, California. It resulted in three people being wounded and one person, the shooter, dying from her wounds.Police are saying the shooting was not an act of terrorism. They have ruled out any ties to international terrorist groups.The motive for the shooting is still under investigation, but the shooter’s website indicates that she was upset with YouTube for censoring her content and demonetizing her videos.

Please refer to the site' The Ultimate Guide To Bail Bonds
Bail is a sum of money that is paid to the court to secure the release of a defendant from jail. The amount of bail is determined by the court and is based on the severity of the crime and the defendant's criminal history. If a defendant is unable to pay the full amount of bail, they can apply for a bail bond. A bail bond is a type of insurance policy that guarantees the defendant will appear in court.
There are two types of bail bonds: surety bail and property bail. Surety bail is the most common type of bail bond and is issued by a bail bond company. The defendant or their family member pays a fee to the bail bond company, which agrees to pay the full amount of bail if the defendant fails to appear in court. Property bail involves using property as collateral to secure the full amount of bail.
If a defendant is released on bail, they are required to follow certain conditions set by the court. These conditions may include not committing any new crimes, appearing in court on the scheduled court dates, and not leaving the state. If the defendant violates any of these conditions, they may be required to return to jail until their court date.
The bail bond process typically involves the following steps:
1. The defendant or their family member contacts a bail bond company and provides information about the defendant and the crime they are accused of.
2. The bail bond company will review the case and determine if they are willing to post a bail bond.
3. If the bail bond company agrees to post a bail bond, they will charge a fee, which is typically a percentage of the total bail amount.
4. The defendant or their family member will pay the bail bond fee to the bail bond company.
5. The defendant is released from jail and is required to follow the conditions set by the court.
The bail bond process can be complicated, and it is important to work with a reputable bail bond company. A bail bond company that has been in business for a long time and has a good reputation can provide peace of mind and ensure that the defendant is released from jail as quickly as possible.

politifact13887,1,0,"Brian Kline is the type of person who voted for President Donald Trump in November. He’s a working-class man whose job is in retail, scoring him $11.66/hour. Thanks to Medicaid he’s being treated for cancer. During the CNN town hall with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, Kline explained his situation and his struggles. “My question is pretty straightforward,” Kline told Price. “Why do you want to take away my Medicaid expansion?” Price’s dispassionate answer seemed to fall flat on the audience. “I took care of a lot of patients with cancer,” Price explained about his 20 years as an orthopedic surgeon. “We don’t want to take care away from anybody. What we want to make certain, though, is that every single American has access to the kind of coverage and care that they want for themselves.”“But, what if there are people out there who are going to die more quickly because of what you’re doing here, because you’re essentially taking medical care away from people who need it the most?” Kline wouldn’t back down. “Are you saying you actually want people to be okay with that?” Price thought for a second, then replied: “Look, I understand how all of this sounds right now, but you know, there comes a time in everyone’s life when they just have to stop talking B.S. and be practical. As of right now, the fact to the matter is, our national budget is hemorrhaging money because of Obamacare. And believe me – I get how insensitive that sounds, but at the end of the day, we have to stop ignoring the facts here.”He continued, “I understand that this is not something anyone wants to hear, especially people who’ve got worse problems to deal with than the state of the national budget, but this is one of those situations where the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. When President Trump assumed office, he was appalled at the state of the national budget and our finances. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that Barack Obama was to blame, since he’s the one who left the hot potato behind for us to deal with. Now, I’m not going to go into whether or not he did that on purpose, but at the end of the day, all I can say is, we have to fix the problem or else we’re looking at nationwide riots and another economic recession.”“Put simply, we have to plug some holes – of which, by the way, there are plenty – and we kind of have to start with the biggest ones,” the orthopedic surgeon added. “Unfortunately for millions of people across the country, Obamacare seems to be the biggest one by far. Besides, there are more ways than one to look at this picture. I know it’s not pretty, but at the end of the day, even people who are able to fight off cancer – I’m sure you know what I’m talking about, Brian – they can’t lead 100 percent normal lives, ever again. What kind of an existence is that, to have to survive instead of live?”“At the risk of sounding insensitive, we’ve pretty much got two choices here: we either repeal Obamacare, or we take out more loans from countries like China. And nobody wants to be in debt to the Chinese. At the end of the day, it’s better for our national budget if cancer patients pass away more quickly, it’s a lousy way to live anyway, and I’m sorry to say it out loud, but it’s the truth,” Price concluded.",Please provide a paraphrase of the passage.

Sources have said that US President Donald Trump will soon issue an executive order to ban Facebook in the country.On the other hand, even some Republican leaders said that they were opposed to the idea of Facebook — an American corporation — being banned in the country.Unfazed by the criticism from his own party members, Trump said that this move would fight fake news being circulated on social media websites. ""Inside, we both know what's been going on. We know the game and we're gonna play it,"" said Trump.Governance involves taking difficult steps, said the US president, adding that despite Facebook taking action against fake news, a lot of false stories and 'alternative facts' were still being circulated on the site.Other social websites like Twitter and Instagram, though, will be excluded from the executive order.The people working for Facebook are not happy about this selective exclusion.Rick Rowlinson, a source from Facebook, said that even if the ban on Facebook was actually meant to fight against fake news, the President's ""commitment"" should have not just been limited to Facebook. ""You know the rules and so do I. A full commitment's what I'm thinking of,"" Rowlinson said. ""You wouldn't get this from any other guy,"" he added, shaking his head.In California, where Facebook is based, a large section of people have already begun protesting against this move.Courts in the US had earlier blocked Trump's travel ban executive order.Keen on supporting the President, Vice President Mike Pence has also said that he will support the executive order if it is passed by Trump.Reacting to this proposed order, Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that Facebook will continue to run its operations from California even if the site is banned in the US.On Trump's claim to fight fake news, Zuckerberg said that an outright ban was not the correct way to fight false news.Last month, reports were saying that a court in Pakistan was mulling action against Facebook over 'blasphemous content'.Lately, there have been some countries speaking out against social media websites.

politifact14126,1,0,"Breaking News: FBI Uncovers Evidence That 62 Million Trump Voters are All Russian AgentsAnonymous sources within the FBI have revealed to The Times that they have new evidence indicating that everyone who voted for Donald Trump is an agent of the FSB (formerly the KGB). An unknown portion of these voters may have had their minds controlled by a Russian space-beam, agents close to the investigation say.The allegation that 62 million Americans appear to be employed by Russian intelligence services has rocked the Bureau, and it is reported that multiple agents have taken their own lives, given that realizing just how deep this Russian hacking conspiracy runs blew their minds — literally.This shocking new revelation comes after it was confirmed as a fact that Russia did Wikileaks because Donald Trump personally called Vladimir Putin and asked him to. It was also revealed earlier this week that Alex Jones (real name “Alexi Jonesinov”) is a Russian sleeper agent who was ordered by the FSB (formerly the KGB) to post news articles on the internet saying that Donald Trump would be a good President.However, the revelation that 62 million Americans are taking orders directly from the Kremlin is a revelation of a whole other order, which FBI agents are struggling with how to deal with.It was determined by Puerto Rican federal judge Mizu Tomazaki that it is a crime to support Donald Trump or to post positive things about him on the internet. 9th circuit judges Weinberg, Steinman and Goldenstein upheld the ruling. Despite this, the logistics of rounding up 62 million people and locking them in prison present a difficult task to overcome.It may also be that not every voter is a direct agent of the FSB (formerly the KGB), and some may have been under the control of a mind control beam in space.“We have not determined for sure that everyone who voted for Trump was paid directly by the Kremlin, given that it is highly possible that the Russians used a space-beam from a satellite to control their brains from a facility in St. Petersburg, and moved their bodies like puppets to the polls to check the Trump box,” one current agent familiar with the investigation told the times, describing the process of using a satellite-mounted space-beam to control people’s actions as “Russian neuro-brain hacking.”When asked for comment on these reports by The Times, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the allegations of space-beam mind control by the FSB (formerly the KGB) were “ridiculous,” “outrageous” and “goofy.” However, Peskov suspiciously asked “vere is Moose and Squirrel?”NSA chief Mike Rogers said that though it is a well-established fact that going all the way back to Soviet times, the Russians have used space-beams to control people’s brains, he’s “never seen anything on this scale before.”The Times also sought comment from President Trump; however, when asked about these allegations, he began screaming in Russian and jumped in a big truck and drove off down the road.You are all nuts…almost 1/2 of America voted to make Trump the legal president, and you keep teling us we don’t matter. Install Hillary by force or some other act of politics, and you will have a civil war on your hands. And just in case you haven’t noticed, Trump’s people have most of the guns.","All this blabber about Trump is only making the situation worse.

politifact15031,1,0,"Four million people dropped off the food stamp rolls in one month, according to the latest numbers on food stamp enrollment from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).The latest USDA data show that the number of participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the government program that administers food stamps, dropped from 45,666,795 in October 2017 to 41,658,868 in November 2017 — a staggering decrease of 4,007,927 over one month.Even though there was a temporary spike in enrollment, mostly concentrated in a few states that caused the national average of food stamp enrollment to spike, nationwide enrollment in the program as a whole is still on a steady decline.Enrollment in the program sharply increased by 3.5 million during the first month of fiscal year (FY) 2018 (October 2017) mostly due to heavy increases in temporary SNAP enrollment in hurricane-affected states such as Florida and Texas.In Florida alone, food stamp participation soared by 2.5 million from September to October due to the state administering Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (D-SNAP) benefits to poor residents affected by Hurricane Irma.The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service approved Florida’s request to administer these special D-SNAP benefits beginning September 10, 2017.A spokesperson for Florida’s Department of Children and Families (DCF) — the program that administers food stamp benefits in Florida — confirmed with Breitbart News that the dramatic increase in SNAP enrollment in the state was due to disaster relief, but that most food stamp recipients were not normal beneficiaries of the food stamp program.“The dramatic increase in SNAP recipients in the fall was related to the state’s administration of the federal disaster SNAP program following the impact of Hurricane Irma. To qualify for the federal disaster food assistance program, individuals must have lived or worked in one of the 48 declared counties on September 5, and NOT be a customer in the regular food assistance program,” said DCF Communications Director Jessica Sims.Sims added that DCF handed out D-SNAP benefits totaling more than $1 billion to 3.1 million people in the months following Hurricane Irma, but the state curtailed its D-SNAP benefit program on December 3.The sharp decline in food stamp enrollment over one month reflects how states like Florida have curtailed their temporary food stamp benefit programs for those affected by natural disasters.But it also highlights an ongoing downward trend in food stamp enrollment that has been going on for several years since state legislatures enacted welfare reform measures designed to get people back into the workforce.The Trump administration announced that it would adopt some of these state welfare reform measures — such as requiring food stamp recipients to work a certain number of hours per week — and implement them at the federal level, causing nationwide food stamp enrollment to plunge even further.Over the past year since President Donald Trump took office, enrollment in SNAP dropped by two million. The latest food stamp numbers show that the downward trend over the past year — and every year after 2013 — is continuing.","As of November 2017, the average monthly enrollment in SNAP has been steadily declining since its peak in November 2012, when it was 47,697,954."

politifact14481,1,0,"There’s a well known saying that “To whom much is given, much is expected” and by all accounts, it appears Floyd Mayweather Jr. knows what he means on the world stage. He’s living up to that expectation. By way of financial support, the newly retired American boxer, Mayweather has offered an overwhelming sum of money to the Hurricane Harvey victims.The World No. 1 undefeated boxer Floyd Mayweather has donated 200 million dollars to help rebuild Houston, after the most populous city in the state of Texas and the fourth-most populous city in the United States was slammed by Hurricane Harvey on Sunday.The donation which will be utilized through his foundation was announced today after he travelled to Houston to ascertain the damage caused by the hurricane.“It is a humanitarian gesture, an act of solidarity and support for a brotherly affected people,” the American boxing hero said.","“I’m one of them, from the same state, and it’s important to me to give back to my community and those in need, especially during these difficult times. We are all in this together and we have to help each other.”Mayweather’s donation is the largest ever for a single event in the United States, according to GiveWell, a non-profit organization that tracks charitable giving.

politifact14643,1,0,"SHARE this story with your friends!10.3k SHARES Share Tweet ShareWhen Donald Trump hinted that he may end aid to Puerto Rico over the mayor of San Juan’s decision to withhold aid from the rest of the country, the city’s other leaders finally took action.While Puerto Rico’s Governor has praised Donald Trump’s efforts to quell the suffering of the people affected by Hurricane Maria, many of those efforts have been in vain because supplies come into San Juan, and the mayor has been stingy with distribution.“We simply don’t have the staff or resources to distribute countrywide,” Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz told a local newspaper, adding that “anyone can come to San Juan if they need supplies.”Unfortunately, that explanation was not good enough for her peers. In an emergency meeting on Thursday, the city council held an emergency meeting to initiate impeachment proceedings which begin on Monday.Donald Trump has helped Puerto Rico and other hurricane-affected areas much more efficiently than any previous President, and Puerto Rico needs to replace their leadership with someone who understands and appreciates that before they lose the aid we aren’t even required to give them.","This is the second time the council has voted to impeach the mayor, but it failed to pass the vote on the first occasion. A spokesperson for the council confirmed that this time, the vote will be binding and will require the mayor to face a trial.A spokesperson for the mayor’s office declined to comment on the matter, saying that they would let the legal process run its course.

Paraphrase:

1. Donald Trump suggested that he might stop providing aid to Puerto Rico if the mayor of San Juan refused to share it with the rest of the country.
2. However, the city’s other leaders decided to take action against the mayor because her decision to limit the distribution of aid was not acceptable.
3. The city council held an emergency meeting to start the impeachment proceedings against the mayor, which will begin on Monday.
4. This is the second time the council has tried to impeach the mayor, but the first time the vote failed.
5. The council’s spokesperson confirmed that this time the vote will be binding, and the mayor will have to face a trial.
6. The mayor’s office spokesperson declined to comment on the matter, stating that they would let the legal process run its course.
7. The mayor’s decision to limit aid distribution was not acceptable to the city’s other leaders.
8. Donald Trump has helped Puerto Rico and other hurricane-affected areas more efficiently than any previous president, but Puerto Rico needs to replace its leadership before losing the aid.
9. The city council has initiated impeachment proceedings against the mayor for the second time, and this time the vote will be binding.
10. The mayor’s office has declined to comment on the matter, stating that they will let the legal process run its course.
11. The mayor’s decision to limit aid distribution was not acceptable to the city’s other leaders.

politifact14128,1,0,"Workers in New Orleans dismantled the city’s Jefferson Davis monument early Thursday, removing the prominent statue of the Confederate leader that had stood for more than 100 years.As workers slung a strap around the statue’s waist and lifted it off its pedestal, at least 100 people cheered from across the street, outnumbering the few dozen protesters of the removal, some waving Confederate flags.“This historic moment is an opportunity to join together as one city and redefine our future,” Mayor Mitch Landrieu said as he announced that crews had begun removing the statue, the second of four planned removals of Confederacy-related monuments.The Mayor also made an announcement that the statue would be replaced with a bronze statue of the 44th President Barack Obama.“It will be nice”, Landrieu said, “to see a monument to our first African-American President in the same spot that used to be a place to memorialize old racist White privilege.”The Obama statue will be patterned after one erected in Kenya last year and will reportedly cost the Louisana taxpayers an estimated $800,000 dollars.Like an earlier removal, this one was performed in the dark because of death threats against city officials and contractors.Beaureguard Billy-Bob Johnson, one of the leaders of the opposition was outraged by not only the statue being taken down but the fact that it occurred in the middle of the night.“We would have preferred it to be in the daytime,” Johnson said, “so everybody could see what they are doing the light of day. And I really hate coming downtown at night with all the darkies afoot and everything.”Before the monument could be removed, police had to clear the immediate area of demonstrators — both supporters of the monuments and those who want them taken away. Barricades were used to keep the sides separated, NOLA.com reported. The news outlet said chants by monument supporters included “Where’s Mitch?” while opponents chanted, “Hey hey, ho ho, white supremacy has got to go.”As Fox news reported earlier, the mayor’s plan calls for the Davis statue to be melted down and cast into smaller statues of Black Lives Matter leaders.","The mayor stated that the removal of the Davis statue was the last step in a four-step process to remove symbols of the Confederacy from public spaces in New Orleans.This statue was placed at the entrance of the city’s City Park in 1911, and for years has been a source of controversy and divisiveness. The statue was moved to a nearby park in 2017, and the city has been working to remove it since. A team of workers used a crane to lift the statue off its pedestal and place it on a flatbed truck. The truck then drove away with the statue, leaving the pedestal empty.

politifact15280,1,0,"A leaked Hillary Clinton email confirms that the Obama administration, with Hillary at the helm, orchestrated a civil war in Syria to benefit Israel.The new Wikileaks release shows the then Secretary of State ordering a war in Syria in order to overthrow the government and oust President Assad, claiming it was the “best way to help Israel”.Newobserveronline.com reports:The document was one of many unclassified by the US Department of State under case number F-2014-20439, Doc No. C05794498, following the uproar over Clinton’s private email server kept at her house while she served as Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013.Although the Wikileaks transcript dates the email as December 31, 2000, this is an error on their part, as the contents of the email (in particular the reference to May 2012 talks between Iran and the west over its nuclear program in Istanbul) show that the email was in fact sent on December 31, 2012.The email makes it clear that it has been US policy from the very beginning to violently overthrow the Syrian government—and specifically to do this because it is in Israel’s interests.“The best way to help Israel deal with Iran’s growing nuclear capability is to help the people of Syria overthrow the regime of Bashar Assad,” Clinton forthrightly starts off by saying.Even though all US intelligence reports had long dismissed Iran’s “atom bomb” program as a hoax (a conclusion supported by the International Atomic Energy Agency), Clinton continues to use these lies to “justify” destroying Syria in the name of Israel.She specifically links Iran’s mythical atom bomb program to Syria because, she says, Iran’s “atom bomb” program threatens Israel’s “monopoly” on nuclear weapons in the Middle East.If Iran were to acquire a nuclear weapon, Clinton asserts, this would allow Syria (and other “adversaries of Israel” such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt) to “go nuclear as well,” all of which would threaten Israel’s interests.Therefore, Clinton, says, Syria has to be destroyed.Iran’s nuclear program and Syria’s civil war may seem unconnected, but they are. What Israeli military leaders really worry about — but cannot talk about — is losing their nuclear monopoly.An Iranian nuclear weapons capability would not only end that nuclear monopoly but could also prompt other adversaries, like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, to go nuclear as well. The result would be a precarious nuclear balance in which Israel could not respond to provocations with conventional military strikes on Syria and Lebanon, as it can today.If Iran were to reach the threshold of a nuclear weapons state, Tehran would find it much easier to call on its allies in Syria and Hezbollah to strike Israel, knowing that its nuclear weapons would serve as a deterrent to Israel responding against Iran itself.It is, Clinton continues, the “strategic relationship between Iran and the regime of Bashar Assad in Syria” that makes it possible for Iran to undermine Israel’s security.This would not come about through a “direct attack,” Clinton admits, because “in the thirty years of hostility between Iran and Israel” this has never occurred, but through its alleged “proxies.”The end of the Assad regime would end this dangerous alliance. Israel’s leadership understands well why defeating Assad is now in its interests.Bringing down Assad would not only be a massive boon to Israel’s security, it would also ease Israel’s understandable fear of losing its nuclear monopoly.Then, Israel and the United States might be able to develop a common view of when the Iranian program is so dangerous that military action could be warranted.Clinton goes on to asset that directly threatening Bashar Assad “and his family” with violence is the “right thing” to do:In short, the White House can ease the tension that has developed with Israel over Iran by doing the right thing in Syria.With his life and his family at risk, only the threat or use of force will change the Syrian dictator Bashar Assad’s mind.The email prov","oked a sharp response from the Obama administration, which accused the State Department of releasing the email in a misleading way in order to smear Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration. The administration’s response also claimed that the email was “doctored” and did not reflect US policy on Syria. However, the email was later confirmed to be authentic by the State Department itself, and there is no evidence to suggest that it has been doctored."

politifact15334,1,0,"‘Smallville’ star Allison Mack has confessed that she sold children to the Rothschilds and Clintons during her time in the child sex cult.According to police, Allison Mack worked in a senior management position for the Hollywood pedophile cult NXIVM. As second-in-command, it was her job to lure children into the cult in order to sell them to elite Hollywood pedophiles and powerful politicians.Thefreethoughtproject.com reports: “As alleged in the indictment, Allison Mack recruited women to join what was purported to be a female mentorship group that was, in fact, created and led by Keith Raniere. The victims were then exploited, both sexually and for their labor, to the defendants’ benefit,” U.S. Attorney Richard P. Donoghue said in a statement.The cult was finally exposed when the daughter of former Dynasty actress Catherine Oxenberg became a member. Oxenberg told the New York Times that she became concerned after she saw that her 26-year-old daughter India was extremely emaciated from dieting, and was suffering from serious health problems.“Some people have said this is a voluntary sorority. The women I have spoken to tell a far different story,” Oxenberg said. “Coercion is not voluntary. Extortion is not voluntary. Blackmail is not voluntary.”When these accusations hit the news, other women, including actress Sarah Edmondson, came forward to all to tell the same story, of the blackmail, the branding, as well as the forced labor and forced sexual activity.Raniere is also accused of having a history of pedophilia, with accusations that stretch back over 20 years, involving girls as young as 12.In 2012, several women were interviewed by the Albany Times Union about the coercive sexual experiences that they had with Raniere when they were young girls. One of the women in the case was found dead of a gunshot wound before she was able to give the interview. Her death was ruled a suicide.The U.S. attorney’s office requested to have Raniere held without bail in a letter to the court stating that he was a known child predator.Although this extremely important detail is being left out of most mainstream reports, one of the main charges in the criminal indictment against Raniere and Mack is sex trafficking of children.A quick search for Allison Mack’s arrest report or charges—as reported by the mainstream media—will not yield any mention of children. Most mainstream reports only mention sex trafficking and ominously omit that the charges were for sex trafficking of children. Exactly why the media is refusing to report this remains a mystery.Another important aspect of this case that has been largely overlooked, is the connections that this organization has to high-level figures in politics and finance. The organization worked much like a pyramid scheme, collecting regular fees from its members. But the majority of the funding, over $150 million, came from the trust funds of Seagram heiresses, Sara and Clare Bronfman.Their involvement with Raniere began in 2002 and has been very public and controversial, with other members of the Bronfman family distancing themselves from the sisters in the press. The Bronfman family has very close ties to the Rothschild banking dynasty, with members of both families belonging to many of the same companies, including their joint financial firm, Bronfman & Rothschild.Additionally, at least three high-ranking members of the organization, including Nancy Salzman and the Bronfman sisters, are members of Bill Clinton’s foundation, the Clinton Global Initiative, which requires an annual $15,000 membership fee.Now that Raniere is in jail and Mack is on bail and ordered not to have any contact with other cult members, Clare Bronfman has taken on the role of leader within the organization.In response to the recent controversy surrounding NXIVM, Bronfman made a statement on her website denying the accusations against Raniere. She praised Raniere and the NXIVM programs, insisting that she is doing work that is tru","ely positive for humanity.She writes, “I am deeply grateful for the life and teachings of Vanguard (Raniere) and for all that I have learned and experienced through my involvement with NXIVM. The work being done by NXIVM is truly positive for humanity and I am committed to continuing this important work.”

politifact15625,1,1,"San Juan mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz’s party are facing fraud charges relating to the embezzlement of over $3 million in federal funds, just months after she appeared on CNN and blamed President Trump for mishandling the Puerto Rico hurricane disaster response.Despite the fact that the U.S. government sent emergency workers, supplies and billions of dollars to the territory, its Democrat-allied politicians still pointed a finger at the president — and the left-leaning mainstream media happily spread the “blame Trump” narrative.As comparisons to George W. Bush and Hurricane Katrina grew, figures like San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz attacked Trump for supposedly mishandling the disaster response, despite the fact that emergency management experts praised the president and FEMA’s actions.“What is really nasty is that anyone would turn their back on the Puerto Rican people,” Yulín Cruz declared at the time, even wearing a T-shirt labeled “NASTY” — where did she get it during a major storm? — as part of a petty jab at the U.S. president.Liberals across the United States, glued to CNN, cheered the San Juan mayor and declared her a national hero. “We are dying, and you (Trump) are killing us with the inefficiency and the bureaucracy,” she said during a television conference in early October.Western Journal reports: Fast forward to this week. It turns out that sure enough, there was plenty of “inefficiency and bureaucracy” in Puerto Rico … but it looks like the island’s own liberal politicians were likely the ones behind it.According to the Associated Press, a Puerto Rican mayor and two additional island officials have now been charged with corruption.Although the alleged crimes go back before Hurricane Maria made landfall in the Caribbean, the arrests paint a dire picture of widespread corruption and misuse of government funds during the same general time frame as the disaster.“The suspects are the mayor of the southwest town of Sabana Grande and the former directors of finance for the northern town of Toa Baja,” the AP reported.“U.S. Attorney Rosa Emilia Rodriguez told reporters that the former officials from Toa Baja are accused of using nearly $5 million worth of federal funds to pay the town’s public employees and municipal contractors,” the newswire continued.“Not only is that illegal, it’s immoral,” Rodriguez added.Puerto Rico officials are accused of taking millions of dollars that was granted by the United States for assistance programs and re-directing it wherever they saw fit, such as taking $2.5 million from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and using it to pay town employees.At the center of the illegal scheme is Miguel Ortiz Vélez, who served as mayor. Ortiz Vélez belongs to the Popular Democratic Party, which is affiliated with the more well-known Democrat party in the mainland United States.Guess who else belongs to the same liberal PDP political group: Carmen Yulín Cruz, the person who was blaming Trump for hurricane deaths while her own party was defrauding taxpayers and laundering aid money. Is anyone surprised?There may be more arrests to follow, as well. Government officials said that more corruption is suspected, and additional Puerto Rican officials are under scrutiny.“Rodriguez said the investigation into alleged corruption in Toa Baja is ongoing because officials believe other people are involved,” the AP confirmed.The hurricane that devastated Puerto Rico was certainly a tragedy, and many lessons about disaster preparedness can be learned from that incident.However, it’s abundantly clear that widespread corruption and incompetence in Puerto Rico was a major part of the chaos. That corruption doesn’t point to Donald Trump … it leads right to the same leftist Democrats who were trying to point fingers the entire time.","In other words, Puerto Rico’s own corrupt politicians were likely the ones responsible for much of the island’s misery, not President Trump."

politifact15146,1,0,"The Democrats mulling a run for the White House in 2020 are facing intense pressure from liberals to campaign on abolishing the agency that enforces federal immigration laws, a proposal that was once relegated to the far-left fringe.In protesting the Trump administration’s policies toward illegal immigration, liberal commentators and writers have been embracing the idea of gutting the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, which identifies, arrests and deports illegal immigrants inside the United States.“This is a growing position on the left, and I imagine 2020 Democratic presidential aspirants will have to grapple with it,” liberal writer and MSNBC host Chris Hayes tweeted.In January, the idea was endorsed by Brian Fallon, a former top aide to 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and Eric Holder, President Barack Obama’s attorney general. The Daily Caller first drew attention to the calls.“ICE operates as an unaccountable deportation force,” Fallon tweeted. “Dems running in 2020 should campaign on ending the agency in its current form.”Thomas Homan, the acting director of ICE, has reacted to these calls by Democrats by saying they should speak to victims of illegal immigrant crime.“These politicians, they need to talk to the victims of alien crime, talk to the parents that I talk to that lost children at the hands of criminal aliens,” Homan said Thursday on Fox News’ “Tucker Carlson Tonight.”But the idea has picked up steam in recent days after Hayes, the MSNBC host, asked Democratic California Sen. Kamala Harris if she believes ICE should exist.“ICE has a purpose, ICE has a role, ICE should exist,” Harris, a potential 2020 candidate, responded. “But let’s not abuse the power.”Since then, Harris, the former attorney general of California, has faced a backlash from liberal publications.“Kamala Harris is very likely running for president in 2020,” Jack Mirkinson of the liberal Splinter website wrote. “It should be a political problem for her that she is not willing to take her criticisms of ICE to their logical conclusion and call for its abolition.”He added: “She should be asked, over and over again, why exactly she is willing to uphold the legitimacy of such a racist, corrupt, and thuggish organization.”Mirkinson wrote that other potential candidates -- like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti -- “should be asked the same question.”PELOSI SLAMS CALIFORNIA ICE RAID AS ‘UNJUST AND CRUEL’The Nation, a liberal magazine, last week also published an article titled “It’s Time to Abolish ICE.” The writer accused the agency of being part of an “unbridled white-supremacist surveillance state” and called it “an unaccountable strike force executing a campaign of ethnic cleansing.”“Though the party has moved left on core issues -- from reproductive rights to single-payer health care -- it’s time for progressives to put forward a demand that deportation be taken not as the norm, but rather as a disturbing indicator of authoritarianism,” McElwee wrote.Democratic officeholders also have been openly rebelling against ICE, including Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, who recently tipped off the public to an immigration raid in the San Francisco Bay Area.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., last week slammed that raid as ""unjust and cruel.""Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in a speech in California last week, said as many as 800 illegal immigrants may have evaded capture and said Schaff’s tip-off put both residents and law enforcement at risk.SESSIONS UNLOADS ON CALIFORNIA DEMS FOR ‘RADICAL, OPEN BORDERS AGENDA’Sessions called California’s ""open borders"" policies a “radical, irrational idea that cannot be accepted.”“It cannot be the policy of a great nation to reward those who unlawfully enter its country with legal status, Social Security, welfare, food stamps, and work permits and so forth,” he said. “How can this be a sound polic","ymaking? How can this be a sound future for our country?”“The American people are not going to tolerate it,” he added. “The American people are not going to stand for it.”The dispute over ICE comes as the Trump administration is pushing for stricter immigration policies, including building a border wall with Mexico and ending a program that protects young immigrants from deportation.In recent days, the Department of Homeland Security has also announced plans to deploy more personnel to the U.S.-Mexico border.IMMIGRATION POLICY HEATING UP

The ‘passage’ describes the increasing pressure from liberals within the Democratic Party to campaign on abolishing the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE), which identifies, arrests and deports illegal immigrants inside the United States. This idea was once relegated to the far-left fringe but has gained traction among liberal commentators and writers. The passage also mentions that some Democratic officeholders have been openly rebelling against ICE, including Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, who recently tipped off the public to an immigration raid in the San Francisco Bay Area. The controversy over the California raid was described as a “dispute over ICE” in the passage.

The passage also includes statements from Thomas Homan, the acting director of ICE, who argued that politicians should talk to the victims of illegal immigrant crime to understand the role of ICE. However, the idea of abolishing ICE has gained momentum among some Democrats, including Kamala Harris, a potential 2020 candidate who was criticized for not calling for the agency's abolition. The passage also mentions Nancy Pelosi, the House Minority Leader from California, who criticized the ICE raid in the Bay Area as “unjust and cruel” and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who accused California of having an “open borders” policy and criticized the state’s “radical, irrational idea” of granting legal status to illegal immigrants. The passage concludes by noting that the dispute over ICE comes as the Trump administration is pushing for stricter immigration policies, including building a border wall with Mexico and ending a program that protects young immigrants from deportation, and that the Department of Homeland Security has announced plans to deploy more personnel to the U.S.-Mexico border."

politifact15599,1,1,"The New York Times had no idea in 1984 that a piece taking a deep dive into the life of an upcoming billionaire would eventually resurface as confirmation of just how PERFECT a fit President Trump is for this time in America. We pulled out the highlights for you below but the entire article is incredible. Who could have predicted in 1984? Well, it seems that The New York Times described brilliant businessman Donald J. Trump as a great future President of the United States…THE EXPANDING EMPIRE OF DONALD TRUMP:‘DONALD! HEY, DONALD! DONALD!’ The men were yelling, eager to call him by name. A storm front of cigar smoke was gathering above the hotel ballroom, packed elbow-to-elbow for a breakfast-hour sports forum with a crowd that included some of New York’s most wealthy, powerful and famous men.He has no public-relations agent. His competitors wonder how this can be, but watching him at the sports forum provided an explanation.While executives of the other teams told the audience about problems of negotiation and arbitration, about dirty restrooms inside their arenas and street crime outside and about ‘attempting to move the Mets in the right direction,’“He said further that he would ‘continue to create chaos’ for the N.F.L. and, by the way, that he planned to build a domed stadium in New York.”Donald Trump was electrifying the room the rat-a-tat-tat revelations, dropping names of star N.F.L. players and coaches he would sign in a matter of hours.IT IS NOT YET 9 AM SPENDING A DAY WITH Donald Trump is like driving a Ferrari without the windshield. It’s exhilarating; he gets a few bugs in his teeth.Although he is still interested in such ideas as putting up the world’s tallest building on the East River, his mind wanders from the business of New York real estate.He has told people in the communications industry that he is ‘very interested in communications,’ which is like a 2,000-pound gorilla mentioning that he is very interested in becoming carnivorous.The Trump touch. It has set some people in New York to outright Trump worship; they call him ‘a real-estate genius’ who has helped lead the city out of the darkness of the mid-1970’s into a new era of glamour and excitement. Mr. Trump does not take exception to that.Many urban-affairs experts view the developers as saviors of our postindustrial cities. ‘With manufacturing leaving,’ says George Sternlieb, director of the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers University, ‘and with Federal and state aid diminishing, our cities desperately need the rich. Cities are tending to fall into two categories: cities of consumption and cities with no economic base.’The rich of the world can live anywhere they want, explain the experts; Mr. Trump leads them to New York. Sales taxes, user taxes, jobs and resulting payroll taxes are generated.That Mr. Trump was able to obtain the location, when every real-estate developer in the world would have done just about anything to get it, is testimony to Donald Trump’s persistence and to his skills as a negotiator. That he was able to put up a building of this dimension on this site demonstrates his finesse with the zoning code.‘He has the uncanny ability to smell blood in the water,’ a competitor says. He obtained the air rights over Tiffany, which allowed him to build a much higher building, and went to Equitable, which sold him the land for a 50 percent interest in the project.The day before he has sent $3,000 to an unfortunate family he has red about in the newspaper, something he does frequently, according to Mrs. Foerderer.For a billion-dollar corporation, there aren’t too many people around.Donald Trump makes or approves practically all decisions. He does not seem to write anything down, keeping volumes of company files as mental notes.Says Louise M. Sunshine, executive vice president: ‘If it is not the impossible, Donald is simply not interested. There has to be creativity. Money ceased to be the object a long time ago.’ Mr. Trump agrees wit","new class of people into the market,’ he says, ‘people who haven’t bought real estate before.’ So he builds projects that cater to the young and the rich. ‘It’s a great life,’ he says of his own lifestyle. ‘It’s very exciting. It’s better than winning the lottery. You know why? Because I didn’t have to worry about the taxes.’When asked if he would ever want to run for public office, he replies, ‘I think I’d make a great President.’A billion dollars can buy a lot of respect, but even without it, Donald Trump has earned it. He is widely admired for his honesty, his energy, his courage, his ambition – and, of course, his money. He is the most well-known and the most flamboyant of New York’s real-estate developers, a man who has remade the city’s skyline and transformed its economy. He is a symbol of the city’s revival, its return to greatness after a long period of decline. And he is, quite simply, a force of nature.Donald J. Trump, billionaire, developer, celebrity, is the most talked-about man in New York. And he is running for President of the United States.

The passage above is a news article written in 1984. It describes Donald Trump as a brilliant businessman and a future President of the United States. The article highlights his negotiating skills, persistence, and ability to get things done. It also mentions that he is a generous person who frequently donates to charity and helps out people in need. The article is not an endorsement of Trump but a report on his success in real estate and his growing influence in the city of New York."

The Washington Post, which endorsed Jones, is the one making the accusation. This is a desperate move by the Democrats to try to smear Moore and keep him out of the Senate. But it won’t work. The people of Alabama know what’s going on, and they aren’t going to be fooled by this fake news.Roy Moore is a man of integrity, and he will not be silenced.

The left is doing everything they can to destroy anyone who stands in their way, but we cannot let them succeed. We must support Moore and all the other conservative candidates who are fighting for our future.Thank you, Roy Moore, for your unwavering commitment to our country and your steadfast refusal to be silenced by the left’s smear campaign.

That old “nanny state” argument rears its head every time.

Bayer suggests that one way to help people quit would be by tackling the problem from the supply side. “I think we would do much better to think about reducing the nicotine content, so that the addictive quality of cigarettes wasn’t as severe, and make quitting easier.” The World Health Organization’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control established a method called MPOWER in 2008 that aims to end the “global tobacco epidemic,” which kills over 7 million people each year. The way to do this is not by banning it all at once, but instead by monitoring use and prevention, protecting citizens from second-hand smoke, offering ways to help people quit, warning people of the dangers of smoking, enforcing bans on advertising, and raising taxes on tobacco products.If you like this blog don't forget to share it.You are currently reading about Smoking In Cars With Children Is Illegal Starting January 30, 2018.

politifact14238,1,0,"Police in Vernal Heights, Florida, arrested 3-practicing cannibals who claim eating human flesh cures both type-1 and type-2 diabetes and depression.According to Vernal Heights Chief of Police, Gregory Moore, the 3-men were arrested when officers responded to what they assumed would be a routine noise complaint.Police arrived at 3845 Toolson Lane (the home of William Provost) at approximately 7:45 PM on Sunday evening in response to a neighbor complaining of strange sounds coming from the home.Responding officers told reporters that they assumed their visit to the house would be a quick one and that they would simply be asking the residents to keep the noise down.When the officers arrived at 3845 Toolson Lane, they repeatedly knocked on the door and rang the doorbell, however, nothing could be heard over the sound a stereo inside the house repeatedly playing the same song, which was later identified as – Enya’s ‘Who Can Say’.After attempting to get the attention of the homeowner via knocking and ringing the doorbell for approximately 5-minutes, police entered the home through an unlocked door located at the rear of the house.The responding officers told reporters that the house had been extremely dark, cluttered, and an overwhelming smell (which was later identified as decomposing flesh) filled the home. Upon clearing the first-floor of the home, the responding officers realized that the blaring music was coming from the home’s basement.According to the officers, a bizarre crime scene was quickly uncovered upon entering the basement. Three men, which have since been identified as 62-year-old William Provost, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore were sitting in a circle on the basement’s concrete floor and ritualistically chanting while eating what police initially believed was an animal carcass, but was later identified as human remains.William Provost, who police believe to be the group’s ringleader, admitted to practicing cannibalism and told arresting officers:“I find human flesh to be the only thing that cures my type-2 diabetes and chronic depression. If expensive pharmaceutical drugs helped, I would figure out a way to obtain them, but they don’t, so I stick to what works for me”.Upon searching the home’s basement, police made several startling discoveries including a large room that appears to contain nothing more than decades worth of clutter, but upon further inspection, police discovered human remains hidden throughout the old wooden furniture and broken appliances.Police also discovered a kitchen style refrigerator located in a small room in the corner of the basement that contained the limbs, organs, and miscellaneous remains of what police believe to be upwards of 7-8 different individuals.In addition to the refrigerator, the small room in the basement also housed a make-shift ‘tool wall’ that contained a myriad of tools that police believe were used to dismember several victims.Upon their initial investigation, police believe the 3-men have been practicing cannibalism for the past 3-4 years and largely remained under the radar due to their practice of targeting and befriending homeless drifters they met at small dive-bars located upwards of 100-miles from their Vernal Heights residence.Vernal Heights Chief of Police, Gregory Moore, spoke to reporters during a brief press-conference this morning.“Though modern-day cannibalism is extremely rare, it does unfortunately exist. That said -treating diabetes and or depression has to be the most bizarre reason for practicing cannibalism that I’ve ever heard.”Provost’s accomplices, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore, also admitted to cannibalizing human flesh because they believed it would cure depression and told arresting officer’s that Provost took them under his wing in late-2012.As of Tuesday afternoon, police and detectives are still conducting a search at the residence located at 3845 Toolson Lane.All three men are current","being held at the Umatilla County Jail and have been charged with multiple counts of murder, cannibalism, and other related charges.

Cannibalism is the practice of consuming the flesh or internal organs of one or more human beings. This can be done for a variety of reasons, including spiritual, cultural, or personal beliefs. Cannibalism is considered a serious crime and is punishable by law in most countries."

Awan was also ordered to turn over all of his passports.A hearing is slated for August 21.Awan’s lawyer, Christopher Gowen, said the charges are politically-motivated and ""began as part of a frenzy of anti-Muslim bigotry in the literal heart of our democracy, the House of Representatives.""""For months we have had utterly unsupported, outlandish, and slanderous statements targeting Mr. Awan coming not just from the ultra-right-wing 'pizzagate' media but from sitting members of Congress,"" Gowen said in an emailed statement.""Now we have the Justice Department showing up with a complaint about disclosures on a modest real estate matter. To an extent, the situation speaks for itself.""","Wasserman Schultz issued a statement Tuesday saying that Awan was fired after the credit union flagged suspicious activity on his account. She also said she had alerted the House's sergeant-at-arms and the Capitol Police about the situation. ""I am concerned about the serious allegations against Imran Awan and am eager to see the investigation proceed to its conclusion,"" Wasserman Schultz said in the statement.Wasserman Schultz did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday.

Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez issued a statement calling for transparency in the investigation and saying that any allegations of wrongdoing should be ""thoroughly and quickly investigated.""""The DNC takes any allegations of wrongdoing seriously and we expect that any investigation will be thorough and unbiased,"" Perez said in the statement."
politifact14161,1,0,"President Trump made Barack Obama look like a complete fool this morning in front of more than 10,000 police veterans when he announced that he would reinstate a national day of remembrance for fallen officers that the traitor before him had done away with.Trump told the crowd the following: “Police officers in this country will no longer be treated like criminals. Obama decided your fallen didn’t deserve to be honored. That changes today. Americans will remember those that keep our streets safe big time.”Obama’s spokesman said the day of remembrance was scrapped so the Black Lives Matter movement wouldn’t be offended. Apparently it’s more important for the friends and families of criminals killed for not obeying simple commands to be coddled than it is for the families and friends of the brave men and women who run into harm’s way to save the innocent to be honored.President Trump has righted that wrong once and for all. If the Black Lives Matter movement wants to remember their dead they can go ahead and burn down their neighborhoods.

politifact14144,1,0,"Seth Rich Seth Rich- EDITOR'S NOTE (5/17/17): We want to update you on a story you first saw on FOX 5 DC. We want to make an important clarification on claims that were made by Rod Wheeler, the private investigator hired by Seth Rich's family, whose services are being paid for by a third party.What he told FOX 5 DC on camera Monday regarding Seth Rich's murder investigation is in clear contrast to what he has said over the last 48 hours. Rod Wheeler has since backtracked.In an interview Monday, Wheeler told FOX 5 DC he had sources at the FBI confirming there was evidence of communication between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks. This is the verbatim of that exchange:FOX 5 DC: “You have sources at the FBI saying that there is information...”WHEELER: ""For sure...""FOX 5 DC: “...that could link Seth Rich to WikiLeaks?""WHEELER: ""Absolutely. Yeah. That's confirmed.""In the past 48 hours, Rod Wheeler has told other media outlets he did not get his information from FBI sources, contradicting what he told us on Monday.Since Rod Wheeler backtracked Tuesday, FOX 5 DC attempted incessantly to communicate with him, but he didn't return calls or emails.On Wednesday, just before our newscast, Wheeler responded to our requests via a telephone conversation, where he now backtracks his position and Wheeler characterizes his on-the-record and on-camera statements as ""miscommunication.""When asked if Wheeler is still working for Seth Rich's family, Wheeler told FOX 5 DC the contract still stands-- ties have not been severed.We reached out once again to the Rich family, and through a spokesperson the Rich family tells FOX 5 DC, ""The family has relayed their deep disappointment with Rod Wheeler's conduct over the last 48 hours, and is exploring legal avenues to the family.""-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Original story:It has been almost a year since Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich was murdered in the nation's capital. There have been no solid answers about why he was killed until now.Rich was shot and killed last July in Northwest D.C and police have suggested the killing in the District's Bloomingdale neighborhood was a botched robbery. However, online conspiracy theories have tied the murder to Rich's work at the DNC.Just two months shy of the one-year anniversary of Rich's death, FOX 5 has learned there is new information that could prove these theorists right.Rod Wheeler, a private investigator hired by the Rich family, suggests there is tangible evidence on Rich's laptop that confirms he was communicating with WikiLeaks prior to his death. Wheeler's services were offered to the family and paid for by a third party, according to a statement issued by the Rich family Tuesday which also includes that ""the private investigator who spoke to press was offered to the Rich family and paid for by a third party, and contractually was barred from speaking to press or anyone outside of law enforcement or the family unless explicitly authorized by the family.""Now, questions have been raised on why D.C. police, the lead agency on this murder investigation for the past ten months, have insisted this was a robbery gone bad when there appears to be no evidence to suggest that.Wheeler, a former D.C. police homicide detective, is running a parallel investigation into Rich’s murder. He said he believes there is a cover-up and the police department has been told to back down from the investigation.""The police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming,” said Wheeler. “They haven't been cooperating at all. I believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer, which I believe is either at the police department or either at the FBI. I have been told both.”When we asked Wheeler if his sources have told him there is information that links Rich to Wikileaks, he said, “Absolutely. Yeah. That's confirmed.""Wheeler also told us, ""I have a source inside the police departm",RichJudicial Watch sues DOJ for documents related to Seth Rich murder investigationSeth Rich’s brother: ‘I just want answers’

politifact14148,1,0,"We all get lazy from time to time and just want to quit everything, crawl back to bed under a layer of blankets and live there until we feel better. We might feel a bit guilty but a relaxing day in bed sounds awesome. Even though it’s a luxury which few of us can afford, at least we can all fantasize about it.If you’re one of those who are in desperate need of some peace and relaxation, NASA might offer you the perfect opportunity to do so and get payed on top of it. But it may involve a bit more relaxation than you’re prepared for.NASA has put out an ad looking for people who’re willing to take part in their “Rest Studies” – a study which will require participant to spend 70 straight days in bed, relaxing and smoking different types of cannabis, for which they will receive a salary of 18.000 USD. During the relaxation period participants are allowed to read books, play games, Skype and smoke weed. They can do whatever they want as long as it involves staying in bed, week after week, earning a cool 1200 USD per week.So what is the exact purpose of these studies?These studies have the purpose of figuring out the best way to preserve astronauts’ health and safety during periods of prolonged space travel. Complete rest and relaxation is the best way to stimulate zero gravity in space because zero gravity actually means zero weight or strain on your muscle. Additionally, they wanted to see how marijuana will affect the body in such an environment.The Rest Study is a very convenient way to examine the changes our body endures during space travel.This study is designed to achieve three core tasks:Examining how the astronauts’ changing physiology in space could affect the process of certain missions.Examining if the astronauts’ physiological state could affect their ability to perform in particular tasks.Preparing countermeasures to combat any impairment that these physiological conditions may impose.The study’s participants were divided into two groups: exercising and non-exercising.The exercising group will have to exercise (on a specially designed equipment to maintain the laying down position and smoke cannabis), while the non-exercising group will just have to lie down and relax completely.The entire study will last somewhere between 97 and 105, depending on whether you’re in the exercising or non-exercising group.Once the study begins, during the initial 13 days (non-exercising subjects) and 21 days (exercising subjects) you can move around the bed rest area freely, in and out of bed. But once this period ends, for the next 70 days you’ll be forbidden from leaving your bed. For 70 days you’ll have to lie down, with your feet up, kick back and enjoy! You’ll get out of bed only for a few tests and nothing more. 70 days of complete lazing.During the study, NASA will have to conduct bone, muscle and heart tests, as well as tests of your circulatory and nervous systems, your nutritional condition, and your body’s immunity system.But is it worth it?You may not think so at first, but spending two whole months in bed can be really excruciating. At some point you may feel like you can’t take it anymore but at least you can rest assured that your efforts will help in the advancement of human space travel.This will probably be your only opportunity to say that you’ve actually helped send the first astronauts to Mars by just being your lazy self and doing nothing in particular but lying flat on your back.Source:http://mysteriousearth.net",/2015/03/24/want-to-spend-70-days-in-bed-smoking-weed-for-18000-usd-heres-your-chance-with-nasa/

It is something that I as well as many others feel needs to be addressed. I love my country, but that doesn’t mean I cannot acknowledge that it is not perfect.”Unfortunately, the owner of the team disagrees.

politifact14905,1,0,"The guest list hasn’t been set for the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, but a number of things could stand in the way of President Donald Trump getting an invite.But a former U.S. president might make the list, due to his friendship with the young British royal: Barack Obama and his wife, former first lady Michelle, who appear to have amiable relations with Harry and his elder brother and future king, Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge.Asked about the potential guest list, Kensington Palace spokeswoman Julie Barley told Newsweek, “We’re focusing on the happy announcement of their engagement,” adding that invitations “will be announced in due course.”Mark Blinch/ReutersWhen the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were married, in 2011, the Obamas were left off the guest list because of the added security costs of protecting the president. The day of the wedding, thousands of Britons took the day off, and about 1,900 guests attended the ceremony in Westminster Abbey in central London. The Obamas traveled to the U.K. less than a month later for an official state visit. Since Obama is no longer president, he doesn’t require as extensive a security detail as he once did.If Trump were to appear at Prince Harry’s wedding in spring 2018, it would likely spark protests. When Prime Minister Theresa May offered Trump a state visit early this year, polls showed that 2 million people intended to take part in a protest against him. The risk of embarrassment, were such a protest to occur at a royal wedding, might put the couple off inviting such a controversial figure.Instead of a state visit, Trump’s trip to the U.K., scheduled for early 2018, has been cast as a “working trip” where he will not meet the queen. In January, sources said Trump wanted to go “one better” than Obama’s state visit and play golf with Queen Elizabeth II at Balmoral Castle.Keep up with this story and more by subscribing nowRead more: Melania Trump “went bananas” when Ivana Trump called herself 'first lady'The Obamas have forged a close relationship with Prince Harry.

Prince Harry also hosted Obama at Kensington Palace in May.As for President Trump, Harry's wife-to-be revealed that she was not a fan.

I mean, come on, if that's reality we are talking about, come on, that is a game changer in terms of how we move in the world here,” she said.Markle supported Democrat Hillary Clinton during the election, calling Trump “misogynistic.”Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other Commonwealth leaders are expected to receive invitations to the wedding because of their nations' ties to the British Empire.","Other foreign leaders, such as French President Emmanuel Macron, could also be invited.The royal family has not released any official statement about the guest list, but a Kensington Palace spokesperson told Newsweek, ""We're focusing on the happy announcement of their engagement,"" adding that invitations ""will be announced in due course."""
politifact15545,1,0,"8.9k SHARES SHARE THIS STORYPresident Trump made a barely veiled threat today on Twitter to Representative Maxine Waters (D-CA) after the congresswoman called for the continued public shaming of members of his administration to hold them accountable for the president’s heinous policies, particularly the immigration policy debacle that led to the separation of thousands of children from their refugee parents at the border.Congresswoman Maxine Waters, an extraordinarily low IQ person, has become, together with Nancy Pelosi, the Face of the Democrat Party. She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 25, 2018Trump, of course, lied about what Rep. Waters called for which was peaceful protests and public demonstrations rather than the “harm” he claims. The “Be careful what you wish for Max!” quote, however, was a dog whistle call to action for his supporters to attack Rep. Waters on par with his warning during his campaign when discussing Hillary Clinton that perhaps “the Second Amendment people” i.e., gun owners could solve the problem.While some people may consider Trump’s tweet as more cheap theatrics for his base, the president’s hate-mongering towards Waters has real-life consequences as the news today about a San Pedro, California man demonstrates.Anthony Scott Lloyd, 45, is expected to plead guilty today to a charge of threatening to kill Rep. Maxine Waters because of her criticism of President Trump.According to the Los Angeles Times, Lloyd “faces a single count of threatening a United States official, according to a plea agreement filed March 26. It is punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.”Lloyd’s plea details the voicemail that he left at Congresswoman Waters’ Washington DC office last October that used both a racial slur and an anti-gay epithet to refer to the representative and stated that:“If you continue to make threats towards the president, you’re going to wind up dead, Maxine, ’cause we’ll kill you.“The voicemail was forwarded to the FBI who investigated it and arrested Lloyd who claims that the call was a “spur of the moment” decision made while listening to conservative talk radio and that he had no real intention of following through with the threat.Unfortunately, we have no such assurances from the president himself, and given Trump’s penchant for simply ignoring the rule of law, that is a frightening proposition.The contrast here is stark between Trump and Waters and the other Democrats whose calls for peaceful activism through public declarations of disgust and shaming of deplorable policies and behaviors are met by Trump and his Republican enablers with threats laden with hints of violence.When those threats lead deranged Trump supporters to take action beyond mere threatening phone calls, the responsibility for incitement to violence will be squarely at Trump’s feet.Add your name to millions demanding Congress take action on the President’s crimes. IMPEACH TRUMP & PENCE!","<https://t.co/R5RPwLvj1y>— The Dangerous Fag (@thedangerousfag) June 25, 2018The tweet from “The Dangerous Fag” above, as well as numerous others, are an example of the kind of threatening and violent rhetoric that Trump’s hate-mongering towards Waters has incited.It is time for Trump and his enablers to be held accountable for their incitement to violence and their encouragement of hate speech.

It seems like a harmless ointment, effective for fever, nasal congestion, and many other affections.But this case will make people question its use, especially moms and dads with small children because it could bring fatal consequences to them.A Mexican mother tells her tragedy to warn other parents and avoid someone else going through what she’s living: the loss of her 2-years-old baby.When she came back from work, she came into her baby’s room. When she got near to kiss him, she felt he had a fever. She imagined it was just a common cold and thought about a home remedy to relieve him.She rubbed Vick VapoRub on his chest, back, and under his nose to help him breathe. She tucked him up and laid down next to him.She was tired, so she fell asleep next to her baby. Hours later, when she woke up, she noticed her son wasn’t breathing.She carried him and took it to the hospital to save him. But, sadly, everything was pointless, the baby had been dead for hours.The medical report stated the child died due to inflammation in the respiratory track, produced by the camphor contained in the famous ointment.She never imagined that home remedy would take his baby. She only wanted to help him breathe, and the ointment did exactly the opposite.The thing is, this remedy is effective for adults; however, for babies younger than two years old, the ointment increases the mucus by 60%. The mucus accumulates on the trachea and blocks the breathing.The label warns the ointment is contraindicated for children younger than 3 years old.Sadly, in the case of the Mexican mother, the warning went unnoticed. Using home remedies for several affections is something common in homes around the world, but we hope this story draw attention to this fact: when children are concerned, we must always read the labels and ask for the advice of experts before using any home remedy.We must not let a simple mistake take our loved ones; we must be careful and seek medical advice to treat any illness.",The passage is about a Mexican mother who used Vick VapoRub on her 2-year-old son and he died due to inflammation in the respiratory track caused by the camphor in the ointment. The mother had never imagined that the ointment would take her child and she warns other parents to read the labels and seek medical advice before using any home remedy on their children.
politifact13577,1,0,"Detroit, MI | A Michigan elector, in a surge of despair at the election of Donald Trump to the US presidency, has taken his life late last night.The 47-year-old man, who leaves behind his wife and six children, took his own life to avoid voting for Donald Trump during the Electoral College that will swear the next president-elect this week.A letter he wrote before taking his own life explains the reasons for his apparent suicide.“ I do not want to carry the burden of Trump’s election on my shoulders, so for the greater good of my children and future generations, I am doing what I believe is best for my country and I hope others will follow in my footsteps ” 1.1kShares 1.1k – Jeremy HashvilleJeremy Hashville, a Michigan elector, has taken his own life to avoid voting in favor of Trump despite Trump’s victory as state laws requires him to vote, an act he hopes others will have the courage to follow to “save his country”.A tragic endAccording to the Detroit City Coroner’s report, the last moments of Mr. Hashville would have been “excruciating painful”.“The deceased would have first attempted to take his life by swallowing 36 laxative tablets that he possibly mistook for antidepressants” describes the 236 pages report.“Despite intolerable intestinal pain, the man then threw himself in front of a bus after literally throwing himself from the balcony of his apartment on the sixth floor but would have miraculously survived,” commented James Arnold of the Detroit Police.“The deceased would have finally covered his own body with gasoline before succumbing to his injuries after lighting himself on fire by inserting his head into the family microwave,” he concluded about the tragic death.","The Electoral College, where Mr. Hashville would have had to vote, is a 538-member body consisting of presidential electors elected in each state to cast a vote for the presidential candidate who won the state’s popular vote. Michigan’s electors are due to vote next week.The vote of a single elector could have swung the election in favor of Hillary Clinton, but the Michigan electors were bound by state law to vote for Trump.According to Mr. Hashville’s letter, “The Electoral College is the only institution that can prevent a madman from becoming president” and that he would “rather burn down the entire system than cast a vote for Trump”.Michigan electors are now in a state of shock and mourning, as they prepare to vote in the Electoral College next week.The tragic death of Mr. Hashville has sparked a national debate on the Electoral College and its role in the US presidential election.The President of the United States, Donald Trump, has not yet made a public statement on the matter.The Detroit City Coroner’s report confirms that Mr. Hashville’s suicide was a tragic but selfless act, done to “save his country” from the perceived danger of a Trump presidency.Mr. Hashville’s family and friends are in deep mourning, as they come to terms with the loss of a loving husband and father.His six children are now left to grow up without a father, while his wife is left to mourn her lost partner and provider.The suicide of Mr. Hashville is a tragic reminder of the emotional toll that politics can take on individuals, and a call to action for all Americans to take their civic duties seriously, but also with a sense of responsibility to the future of their country.

politifact14908,1,0,"Delta Force Raids Obama Stronghold in Thailand[Note: Please view our newest article on Trump’s attack against Deep State assets: FBI RAIDS HOME OF HILLARY CLINTON COLLABORATORDuring the pre-dawn hours on Christmas Day, Delta Force operators launched a precision strike against an Obama-controlled stronghold in Thailand, says an active Secret Service agent who claims President Trump green lit the operation following a series of telephone calls to United States military commanders and to Thailand Prime Minister Nik Bukharin.A Delta detachment, known as 1-SFOD in the Special Operations community, flew from Okinawa, Japan to the United States Embassy in Bangkok, and held position while Trump cleared the incursion with his Thai counterparts.According to our source, the Trump administration learned that Obama, by proxy, owned a mansion and a 400-acre estate on the outskirts of the city of Si Sa Ket, approximately 500 km from Bangkok. On paper, the land was owned by the allegedly defunct Solyndra Corporation, a startup solar company to which Obama gave 2.2 billion taxpayer dollars in 2009. Shortly thereafter, Solyndra declared bankruptcy, and the money vanished. Despite apparent poverty, Solyndra maintained real estate holdings valued at over 800 million dollars in a half-dozen Southeast Asian countries. The Trump administration connected the dots, linking Obama to the Thai property, after asserting Presidential privilege and subpoenaing flight records that demonstrably proved Obama had travelled to Si Sa Ket six times as president and an additional four times in the past year.In a June 2009 edition of the Washington Beacon, conservative author Thomas Clearwater wrote, “Solyndra does not appear to be a legitimate institution, and is likely a shell company or slush fund used or owned by Obama to launder his dirty money.”Our Secret Service source supports that contention.“Obama holds real estate, vast sums of currency, and shadow companies across the globe, under many aliases. He doesn’t keep them in his name, as that would be too conspicuous. The administration has learned about many of them and has been working with foreign governments to seize Obama’s illicitly gained assets. Many of these nations are not exactly friendly to the United States; we don’t know what Trump offered in exchange for rights to seize assets in non-extradition countries or put special operations boots on the ground on foreign soil. I’m sure the price way high. Clandestine missions are occurring right now. The Solyndra mansion was just one of many,” our source explained.At 3:00 am (local time), a pair of helicopters, including decoy craft, airlifted Delta to its destination. They found the mansion deserted; however, according to our source, the dwelling had been recently occupied. The unit commander discovered freshly chopped vegetables and lukewarm coffee in the kitchen; outside fresh tire impressions lead away from the compound. Someone, our source said, must have tipped off the occupants shortly before Delta arrived on scene.Still, Delta did not leave the location empty-handed. They seized several encrypted laptops and over 200 million dollars in gold bullion, in addition to dozens of crates containing Chinese manufactured firearms and explosives. Moreover, and perhaps most disturbing, a maze of underground tunnels, ostensibly used for human trafficking, ran for miles in every direction beneath the surface. Having gathered all available evidence, they requested exfiltration and handed-off control to Thai law enforcement.Under power granted by the ASEAN Declaration to Joint Action on Counter Terrorism, Thai officials confiscated the estate and all remaining possessions contained therein.(Visited 18,013 times, 4 visits today)","FacebookTwitterPinterestSave分享0shares

politifact15187,1,0,"Having teenagers act as figureheads for a movement has a certain quality that has not gone unnoticed in the wake of the March for Our Lives rally on Saturday.Judge too harshly, and you are attacking a kid who has balanced trauma with homework. Amplifying students such as Emma González has injected optimism among liberal activists in the grinding debate about the role of guns in society.[How the Parkland teens became villains on the right-wing Internet]González, 18, has been at the flash point of this dynamic, appearing in newspapers, on magazine covers and in a prominent spot at the anchor rally in Washington, where her speech, which included a prolonged silence, lasted as long as the six minutes it took a gunman at her high school in Parkland, Fla., to kill 17 people on Valentine’s Day.Gun-control advocates have held up González as a figurehead of the movement, splashing her trademark shaved head on T-shirts and viral images.Then, there is another viewpoint of her activism.A doctored animation of González tearing the U.S. Constitution in half circulated on social media during the rally, after it was lifted from a Teen Vogue story about teenage activists. In the real image, González is ripping apart a gun-range target.[NRA host taunts Parkland teens: ‘No one would know your names’ if classmates were still alive]The doctored image mushrooming across social media appeared to confirm the belief among Second Amendment absolutists that calls for stricter gun-control measures are transgressive, destroying the very foundation of the United States.The animation bounced around conservative Twitter before it received a signal boost Saturday from actor Adam Baldwin.He tweeted to a quarter of a million followers with a hashtag reading “#Vorwärts!” — the German word for “forward” and an apparent reference to the Hitler Youth, whose march song included the word.Not gonna happen. pic.twitter.com/4kKBcSqdCl — Gab: Free Speech Social Network (@getongab) March 24, 2018Gab, the Twitter-like social network that is a popular refuge for the alt-right, tweeted the animation on Saturday to more than 100,000 followers, then hours later asserted it was “satire.” It racked up more than 1,200 retweets. The still images, looking more sophisticated than the glitchy animation, went further, appearing to be taken as legitimate by some conservative-minded Twitter users.The pushback seems to have gained more traction than the original images, although that means the original images are also spread wider.Donald Moynihan, a professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, debunked the altered image, saying in a tweet: “Just a sample of what NRA supporters are doing to teenagers who survived a massacre (real picture on the right),” referencing a user named “Linda NRA Supporter” who posted the photo and whose account has since been suspended.Justy a sample of what NRA supporters are doing to teenagers who survived a massacre (real picture on the right). pic.twitter.com/czX7IHD8ur — Don Moynihan (@donmoyn) March 25, 2018Moynihan’s tweet keyed on an idea: Public moments by the Parkland students are being scrutinized and stretched to either bolster or tear down arguments on social media, built on the traditional debates made around the dinner table.Generally, one form of criticism of González and fellow students such as David Hogg, 17, has focused on their ages.They are too naive and young to grasp the extent of how money, politics and policy intersect, the argument goes. It was cemented in the right’s criticism of Hogg’s insistence that clear backpacks would infringe on civil rights.The online effort to defuse Hogg has paid off. The first “top news” video that appears in a YouTube search for “David Hogg” is a takedown from conservative outlet the Blaze. “It’s hard to not just go after this kid,” host Pat Gray said in the video published Saturday, describing Hogg.[How conspiracy theories about the Parkland attack enter the mainstream]Other elements of González ha","are being manipulated by adults.The NRA’s “Dana Loesch” series of tweets has been particularly critical of González and her classmates, pointing out their youth and arguing they are pawns in a larger debate.But González has persisted, and her activism has been rewarded. She has been named Time magazine’s “Next Generation Leader,” and Saturday’s march was the largest gun-control demonstration in history. She is a symbol of the activism that has emerged from the tragedy at her school, and her voice will only grow stronger as she continues to challenge the country’s gun laws and the influence of the NRA.Given the reactions to the Parkland students’ activism, it is possible that their public-facing efforts will continue to be scrutinized and their images manipulated for political purposes. It remains to be seen how they will respond to this pressure and continue to push for change."

One of six children (and the only daughter), Nancy (Patricia D'Alesandro) Pelosi was born on March 26, 1940, and grew up in Baltimore's Little Italy.2. Pelosi's father, Tommy D'Alesandro, was a legendary Democratic congressman and Baltimore mayor. Her brother Thomas would also go on to become mayor of Baltimore.3. Seemingly, Pelosi was a Democrat from birth—as a young girl, she was offered a toy elephant by a Republican poll worker but recoiled, refusing the toy.4. A devout Catholic, Pelosi attended a Roman Catholic women's college, Trinity College, in Washington, D.C., where she met her future husband, Paul Pelosi, who was attending Georgetown. They eventually relocated to his hometown, San Francisco.5. Pelosi is mother to five—Nancy Corinne, Christine, Jacqueline, Paul, and Alexandra, all born within six years—and grandmother to five.6. Although active in politics her whole life—including stints as a leading Democratic fundraiser and chairwoman of the party in California—Pelosi didn't run for office until she was 47, preferring to wait until the youngest of her five children was a high school senior before running for Congress in 1987.7. Republican National Committee Chairman Ken Mehlman said that she was neither a ""new Democrat"" nor an ""old Democrat"" but a ""prehistoric Democrat."" Other Republicans call her a ""latte Democrat"" for her politically progressive views on the environment, women's reproductive rights, labor unions, and other issues.8. Pelosi has been a formidable force within the Democratic Party, raising more money than any other congressional Democrat–around $100 million since taking the reins of party leadership. And she has managed to keep the House Dems toeing the party line: According to Congressional Quarterly, House Democrats voted with the majority of their party 88 percent of the time in 2005, the highest total since CQ started keeping track in 1956.9. Pelosi learned the art of politics from her father, a practitioner of old-school politics. To practice her penmanship, ""Little Nancy"" was in charge of the book in which her New Deal father kept track of favors done and owed.10. A true San Franciscan, Pelosi makes sure that her office is stocked with Ghirardelli chocolates. Her diet typically consists of mostly chocolate and chocolate ice cream.

politifact13687,1,0,"The Republican war on women continues unabated. The same week that conservatives argued in the Supreme Court that employers should be able to stop their employees from getting contraception outside of the company health plan, Indiana joined the ranks of states like Texas and Florida in passing a draconian law that purports to protect women, while in fact, endangering their health by making safe abortion much harder to get. And Gov. Mike Pence recently signed it. The bill is stuffed with as many asinine restrictions on abortion with an eye towards making abortion as miserable and humiliating an experience as possible, and ideally something women can’t get legally at all.Asked to comment on his approval of a piece of legislation that basically promotes hatred towards women once stripped of all the legal terms, Pence argued in an interview with The Huffington Post that “abortion as such was a mistake since the day it was first invented.” “So, let’s get that straight right away – I oppose abortion for any reason whatsoever because I believe that killing someone, or something, if you will, that hasn’t developed a consciousness just yet is the ultimate act of crime. And if we’re murderers of innocent beings who can’t defend themselves, how are we to expect people with a fully developed consciousness to stop murdering each other?” the Indiana governor said.“And as if that wasn’t enough,” Pence continued, “we’ve got this situation now throughout different states where some lawmakers allow abortion under some circumstances like rape or when the fetus is diagnosed with an illness, and others just flat out prohibit it. And that’s bad for a number of reasons. First and foremost – we can’t have this kind of freedom of choice. This is bad, let’s be clear. And that’s part of the reason why I signed this bill, because I believe abortion, or I’m going to flat out call it murder, this murdering of children has to stop and it has to be prohibited in every state. So Indiana is just a step in the right direction.”Pence also tried to offer his opinion on what would have happened had he allowed rape victims to still have abortion. “First and foremost, because this is such a sensitive topic, let me just say that I sympathize with rape victims not just in America, but around the world. I can only imagine what it must be like to experience such trauma,” he said. “However, that does not justify murder, not even that justifies murdering a baby, not in my book. Because what would happen? We’d then have an epidemic of women claiming to have been raped just so they could have an abortion. And that has to be stopped at all cost.”Donald Trump’s new running mate also said, “Basically, if I’d have said no on the bill, that would be just like giving out get-pregnant-without-fear cards, because at the end of the day, women could have unprotected sex without worrying about what they’d do in the event of pregnancy. And you know, it’s not supposed to be like that. That would be equal to me picking up a butcher’s knife and slicing people open in the middle of the street. That would be murder. And I’m not a murderer.”“And it gets worse – when you get an abortion, you get several days off of work and whatnot to recover. And there are a lot of crazy people out there. What if women would go out and get raped on purpose just so they could get off work? I mean, Indiana’s economy is struggling as it is, and having thousands of women absent from their jobs would be horrific for the state, I’m telling you. I made the right call and that will be confirmed in the long run,” Pence concluded.","Mike Pence’s recent comments and his signing of the “Human Life Protection Act” are just the latest example of the Republican party’s ongoing campaign against women’s reproductive rights. The law imposes a number of restrictions on abortion, including requiring women to undergo a medically unnecessary ultrasound at least 18 hours before the procedure, and mandating that doctors who perform the procedure provide patients with information on “fetal development, including a description of the unborn child’s organs and body systems, as well as the facts of fetal development from conception to birth, including pictures of the developing unborn child, and a description of the development of the unborn child’s senses of sight, hearing, taste, touch, and smell.” The law also makes it a felony for a woman to seek an abortion because of the race, gender, or disability of the fetus.

In response to his signing of the law, one commenter on Twitter wrote, “Mike Pence is a dangerous and cruel man. His ‘Human Life Protection Act’ is a blatant attempt to control women’s bodies and restrict access to safe and legal abortion. This is not what America stands for.”"

The process included using an air compressor to put pot smoke into the tank before using a regulator to inhale.According to multiple reports, Fitzpatrick invited his buddies over to check out the ‘Scuba Bong,’ a name that is both inaccurate and sounds much too much like ‘Scuba Bomb,’ when the accident occurred. While attempting to attach the air compressor to the tank, the victim knocked over the tank causing an explosion that would send shrapnel into his groin, severing his balls clean off.None of his friends were injured in the accident.The tank in question was fashioned in the early 90’s with a type of aluminum that is known for its capacity to rupture.

politifact15539,1,0,"Less than one week after kicking out White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and continuing to harass her family, “Red Hen” owner Stephanie Wilkinson finally received a bitter taste of her own intolerant medicine.When conservatives encounter someone with whom they disagree, they try to engage in meaningful debate. With liberals, there is only resistance. Instead of inviting civil discourse, leftist ideologues are resorting to suppression, harassment, and even physical violence in response to “problematic” ideas. Of course, they’re quickly discovering that their juvenile and fascist actions have consequences.On Friday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and her extended family members, many of whom are liberals, were forced out of the Red Hen eatery in Lexington, Virginia, by co-owner Stephanie Wilkinson. Although the party politely obliged the indignant staffers, Wilkinson proceeded to gather her comrades and stalk Sanders’ family at another restaurant, screaming insults and demanding they leave. Now that word of her behavior is national news, Wilkinson is being forced to live by her own principles.Red Hen co-owner Stephanie Wilkinson has not only been forced to step down as executive director of Main Street Lexington, according to Fox News, she’s also placed herself in the center of what could turn into a massive lawsuit for damages concerning the effect her discrimination against Sarah Huckabee Sanders has had on Red Hen establishments across the country. Along with her resignation from the organization, Wilkinson’s bigotry has caused unaffiliated Red Hen restaurants across the U.S. to suffer protests, negative reviews, and boycotts, CBS News reports.Main Street Lexington president Elizabeth Outland Branner offered a short response in reference to Wilkinson’s resignation, which is undoubtedly a move toward damage control for the group, which represents many local businesses.“Considering the events of the past weekend, Stephanie felt it best that for the continued success of Main Street Lexington, she should step aside,” Branner wrote in an email.Wilkinson has caused such severe damage to other like-named establishments that business owners are desperately addressing the public outrage by disavowing the disgraced liberal feminist and declaring that it is illegal to refuse service to customers based on their political leanings.More than 4,300 replied, including multiple tweets calling on the restaurant to condone Sanders and the Trump administration’s actions. The Red Hen answered the threats by defining “unaffiliated” as well as an explanation that it is illegal for businesses in the District of Columbia to discriminate against people because of their political views.Another Red Hen restaurant, this one in Swedesboro, New Jersey, also faced a slew of angry calls and social media posts for refusing to serve a woman who’d never stepped through their door.“Kindly check your facts before you erroneously defame an innocent victim on Facebook,” said a post on the family-owned restaurant’s Facebook page.The manager of a New Jersey-based restaurant with the same name lamented that their location’s rating has plummetted from “4.8 stars to three-point-something.” An owner in Saybrook, Connecticut, attempted to prevent this same damage by adding a pop-up box stating that their restaurant has “absolutely no affiliation with any other Red Hen restaurant anywhere else.”Wilkinson has defended her discriminatory actions, ironically claiming that she doesn’t enjoy “confrontation” but feels a moral duty to harass political figures and their innocent family members.“I’m not a huge fan of confrontation,” Wilkinson told The Post. “I have a business, and I want the business to thrive.” But, she went on to say, “This feels like the moment in our democracy when people have to make uncomfortable actions and decisions to uphold their morals.”When the mainstream media propagates that those with certain political views are “Na","ive, Uninformed, or Dangerous” and that businesses can refuse service to customers based on their political beliefs, it is imperative that the public holds them accountable for the consequences of their biased actions.In conclusion, Wilkinson’s behavior has not only cost her personally but also has caused significant harm to the businesses affiliated with the Red Hen brand. With the public now aware of the potential for discrimination, businesses must be cautious in their interactions with customers to avoid any legal repercussions. Furthermore, it is crucial for individuals to support those who promote tolerance and inclusivity, as they are the true guardians of our democracy."

politifact13560,1,0,"The announcement that Mall of America was welcoming its first black Santa Claus was greeted in many quarters as a good thing but, as might be expected in a country that has become increasingly more comfortable saying any racist thing that comes to mind, many were highly offended. Three years after Fox’s Megyn Kelly definitively explained to America that both Jesus Christ and Santa Claus were white men, Mall of America dismissed her advice and hired Larry Jefferson, a retired U.S. Army veteran from Irving, Texas to spend four days at the mall listening to the wish lists of children of all colors.Among many who were offended by this move was former half-term governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin. The sharp-tongued Republican wasted no time in condemning the company’s actions, going on social media and posting comments that called for boycotting and “running Mall of America into the ground,” on the basis of Santa “always having been white in the Bible.” “No, I refuse to believe that they went this far in trying to cater to the minorities, I thought the company had some backbone but I guess I was wrong,” Palin told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune.She also argued that hiring a non-white Santa Claus was “the last straw” in corporate America’s twisting of traditional, conservative Christian values, “because they realized they couldn’t make any more money off of the usual scams and techniques they’ve been using so far.” She added, “That’s why they had to come up with something new and out of the box, at least something that appeared that way in their minds. But, this proves that they have no morals and that they won’t shy away from even the most blatant twisting of traditional Christian values, just so they could make more money. I understand having to make a profit in order to get by and have a good life, but I don’t understand stomping on things that are holy and sacred in order to accomplish that.”“That’s why Americans, especially white ones, need to boycott the company and need to run it into the ground, so that they never ever come up with such an offensive and sacrilegious idea again,” Palin added. “The Holy Book always said Santa Claus was white and any kind of deviation from that, regardless of its magnitude, is a sin. And we need to make an example out of Mall of America. If we don’t, if we let them get away with it, what’s next? Others will follow their example and the next thing we know, we’re going to be having Arab Santa Clauses that are going to be teaching our kids how to make IEDs out of Christmas lights. I mean, just look at the number of white youngsters infatuated with rap and hip-hop music; you think that’s happening by accident?”“Nope, our children are systematically being indoctrinated into other cultures and interests that have nothing to do with traditional, white Christianity. The numbers of converts to Islam have also spiked, just as much as interracial marriages between white women and members of other ethnic groups. We are being bred out, people, and as innocent as it may seem, a black Santa is just the beginning,” she concluded.","Palin’s comments were met with a mixture of outrage and ridicule on social media, with many pointing out that the former governor was once again demonstrating her ignorance and bigotry. Others argued that her comments were just a desperate attempt to get attention and that she should be ignored.

What AMLO is asking his people is not a surprise…He has an actual strategic policy behind his plan.Apparently, he has been planning this for years but nobody really cared to pay attention.AMLO’s key economic plan for Mexico is to become wealthy, and recently he has received a broad mainstream Mexican understanding.Conservatives in the U.S. have no idea about Mexico’s plan, but the far-left and democratic immigration radicals sure do.Reported by 100percentfedup: Well…at least a leader of Mexico is admitting what’s been going on for a loooong time. The radical open borders element on both sides has been welcoming millions of illegals for decades. Yes, decades…Open borders advocates on the left see policing the border as a form of cruelty and American imperialism. There are also radical organizations that feel Mexico deserves a southern portion of America.La Raza aka “The Race” is a radical organization seeking open borders along with many of the George Soros-funded open borders groups:GEORGE SOROS’S OPEN BORDER FOUNDATIONS: An inside look at the machinations of the multibillionaire and his mission to destroy national sovereignty.THE FUTURE PRESIDENT OF MEXICO… Andrés Manuel López Obrador aka AMLO:(From the Daily Caller) […] “And soon, very soon — after the victory of our movement — we will defend all the migrants in the American continent and all the migrants in the world,” Obrador said, adding that immigrants “must leave their towns and find a life in the United States.” He then declared it as “a human right we will defend.”The Conservative Treehouse warns: It would take Mexico several decades to achieve a level of wealth even close to the U.S., and they have no structural (political) systems in place to form the foundation of such an approach. So, AMLO’s faster plan is to use migration into the U.S. to break down barriers, collapse the economic dam and allow the natural flood of U.S. wealth to flow into Mexico.From the Mexican perspective this is a pretty solid economic approach that just might work; and they have open-border comrades within the progressive, democrat, republican and corporate political systems (all over the U.S) who already support such a strategy.Read More",:<https://www.breitbart.com/border-security/2019/07/02/exclusive-mexican-presidential-candidate-openly-urges-migrants-to-flood-u-s-border/>
politifact15004,1,1,"An NFL entertainment lawyer, who has worked for the corporation for more than 15 years, has been found dead in New York City hours after telling reporters that Super Bowl LII is “rigged.”Dan Goodes was found dead in his hometown of New York City in what early reports described as an “gangland-style execution”, hours after blowing the whistle on the “rigged Super Bowl” backstage at a promotional event in Minneapolis.Early reports claim the 49-year-old was found shot dead in a 2017 BMW 2 Series, along with one other man, believed to be a close friend.Goodes, an entertainment lawyer who worked at the National Football League’s Park Avenue headquarters, had been representing the NFL in Minneapolis, working alongside Eagles and Patriots franchise staff on promoting Sunday’s Super Bowl featuring the two teams.However Goodes went “off-script” in Minneapolis and was “physically removed” from the premises by security staff, but not before publicly condemning the NFL as “totally corrupt” and claiming the Super Bowl is “fixed.”Telling reporters that he is a “football fan first and foremost, and a lawyer second”, Goodes said “Football in America in 2018 doesn’t need another rigged Super Bowl. We need a great match. Not another rigged result that doesn’t pass the sniff test.“I like money as much as the next guy. But I like football more. I can’t stand by and allow rampant greed and cynicism to destroy the game I love. The little boy in me won’t allow it.“Football in America won’t recover from this.”Early reports stating Goodes had been shot dead in an “gangland-style execution” in New York City have also been scrubbed from the internet, but not before alert readers captured screenshots of the story.According to Goodes, the NFL have organized a “rigged game” that will earn “maximum revenue” for the league, and hundreds of millions for broadcasters and advertisers, but will leave increasingly jaded Americans with a bad taste in their mouth.“This is the biggest scam in sports history,” Goodes said in Minneapolis, according to reports. “The Super Bowl is already completely scripted out.”“How do I know it’s scripted? I’ve read the damn thing.““You need to understand the NFL is a $35 billion shared revenue corporation. Outcomes can’t be left to chance. Total league revenues are shared equally by all franchises, so they don’t care who wins or loses. Let me be perfectly clear here. It doesn’t matter to the franchise owners. It doesn’t matter to the players. But it matters to the league. Outcomes have been fixed to maximize profits ever since my early days here.”“The sad thing is that it’s legal. Can you believe that? It’s legal thanks to guys [entertainment laywers] like me.”Explaining that the NFL is officially registered as “entertainment,” Goodes said “The NFL has more in common with WWE than you could possibly imagine.”The NFL possesses an Anti-Trust Exemption to the law granted to it by President John F. Kennedy, which ultimately allows the NFL to classify itself as “entertainment” rather than sport, as well as incorporate itself as a single entity, instead of the 32 separate “franchises” they would want you to believe.In a 2004 lawsuit, the NFL argued they are not a collection of 32 teams in competition with each other. They argued they are a single entity, providing “entertainment” in the marketplace, and as such they are not subject to Anti-Trust laws.The only other “sport” that occupies this legal position is the WWE.How are games rigged?According to Goodes, the fat cat franchise owners and their pampered players do not care who wins, as long as they continue reaping the lucrative financial benefits provided by the system.“Have you ever stopped to wonder how Vegas makes the point spread line and over under so close every week? There is not one game where the result totally blows away the point spread or the over under. It doesn’t happen. Are they that good? Hell, no they’re not. Even the best of the best cannot get it so close every singl","week,” Goodes said in Minneapolis. “It’s all fixed. That’s why they call it the National Football League. It’s not a league, it’s a brand. The NFL doesn’t want you to call it the National Football League. They want you to call it the National Football League. So you will remember it’s a brand. The NFL is a brand. The NFL is not a league. The NFL is a brand. And like all brands, the NFL needs to protect its brand.”“It’s not about who wins or loses. It’s about controlling the outcome. It’s about making sure the game is not too close. Because if it’s too close, the public will get too invested. And if the public gets too invested, the public will start to question. And if the public starts to question, the public will see. And when the public sees, the public will act.”What is the NFL’s Anti-Trust Exemption?The NFL’s Anti-Trust Exemption is a law granted to the league in 1966 by President Lyndon B. Johnson. The law essentially allows the NFL to classify itself as “entertainment” rather than sport, and incorporate itself as a single entity, instead of the 32 separate “franchises” it would want you to believe.The Anti-Trust Exemption grants the NFL immunity from Anti-Trust laws, which means the NFL can collude with other teams, set prices, and control the market without facing legal consequences. The exemption is unique to the NFL and WWE, and has been a point of controversy for decades.How are games rigged?According to Goodes, the fat cat franchise owners and their pampered players do not care who wins, as long as they continue reaping the lucrative financial benefits provided by the system. “The NFL doesn’t want you to call it the National Football League.

politifact14327,1,0,"Following the recent resignation of Director of the Office of Government Ethics Walter Shaub Jr., the Trump Administration has unexpectedly accepted another resignation: White House Chef Lisa Mead.Mead reportedly decided to resign because President Donald Trump hasn’t utilized her culinary talents even once the entire time he has been living in the White House.“It’s kind of crazy because Lisa is such a good chef,” said Kurt Reno, the White House aide who recommended Ms. Mead for the job. “But Lisa feels insulted because the President has ordered fast food for literally every single meal he’s eaten in D.C. The only food-related duty Lisa has done for the past six months is retrieve Trump’s orders from drive-through windows and scoop the President’s ice cream from the carton.”Mr. Trump’s favorite fast food choices are reportedly Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonalds, and he eats his fried chicken, burgers, and fries with a knife and fork according to a White House staffer who requested anonymity to avoid consequences from leaking about the President’s eating habits to the press.“It’s borderline creepy,” the staffer said. “The first thing Trump does with his fried chicken is pick off all the skin from every piece like he’s dissecting the chickens with a scalpel or something, and then he puts it all in a pile. Then he cuts off all the lean meat and throws it away, leaving just the pieces of fat which he then eats individually with pieces of the crispy skin he peeled off. It’s gotta be a warning sign of a serial killer or something.”Mr. Trump’s McDonalds habits are even weirder.“He orders the same thing every time,” said the staffer. “He orders two big macs, a large fry, a diet coke of course, and an M&M McFlurry that he has Lisa dig out and remove every brown M&M, and then he makes her dump out half of the ice cream and fill it back up with extra M&M’s. Then he cuts off pieces of his big macs and dips them in the McFlurry so every bite has ice cream and chocolate on it. He dips his fries, still with a fork, in the diet coke as if it were a condiment. The sight of this never gets normal. When Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe saw this routine he threw up.”No wonder Chef Lisa Mead quit.

Decoding the Behavior of the GOP
Decoding the Behavior of the GOPPosted on July 11, 2019July 11, 2019By Elizabeth DaigneauIn recent years, the Republican Party has been criticized for its tone-deafness to issues affecting communities of color, women, and the LGBTQ+ community. Some have argued that the party is in a state of decline, unable to adapt to changing demographics and political realities. But others argue that the GOP is simply engaging in a strategy of “dog whistle politics” to appeal to its base. What is dog whistle politics? And how does it play out in the context of the GOP? To understand these dynamics, it’s important to look at the historical context in which the GOP developed its political identity. The party was founded in the mid-1800s as a response to the growing power of the federal government and the spread of slavery. The GOP’s early leaders, such as Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses S. Grant, were committed to limiting the power of the federal government and protecting individual liberties. This emphasis on limited government and individual freedom has remained a core tenet of the GOP’s platform. But over the years, the party has shifted its focus to issues such as tax cuts, immigration, and national security. In recent years, the GOP has become increasingly polarized and partisan, with many conservative lawmakers and activists pushing for an agenda that prioritizes a narrow set of conservative values. This shift has been driven in part by the rise of the Tea Party movement, which emerged in 2009 as a response to President Barack Obama’s election and the passage of the Affordable Care Act. The Tea Party movement was fueled by a deep sense of anger and resentment at the perceived overreach of the federal government and a belief that the country was moving in the wrong direction. The movement was able to mobilize a significant number of voters and influence the GOP’s direction, leading many to question the party’s commitment to limited government and individual freedom. Dog whistle politics refers to a strategy of communicating a message that is intended for a particular audience without explicitly stating it. It involves using code words, euphemisms, or other cues to signal a particular message to a particular group of people. For example, if a politician refers to “law and order” in a speech, they may be appealing to white voters who see themselves as the real victims of crime. The term “law and order” has been used by conservative politicians for decades as a way to appeal "

politifact14776,1,1,"Pope Francis’s latest controversial statement – that “Jesus is metaphorical, not literal” – has pushed the Catholic Church to the verge of open mutiny, with multiple Vatican cardinals going on the record declaring Pope Francis is the false prophet foretold in holy scripture and prophecy.The statement made by Pope Francis during Holy Mass in the Vatican on Sunday is the latest in a long line of unconventional statements uttered by the pontiff since he ascended the highest office in the Catholic Church, becoming the first jesuit pope in history.Since assuming the papacy in 2013, Pope Francis has operated as a mouthpiece of the globalist movement, taking every opportunity to push the New World Order agenda. A short list of Francis’s most controversial statements include:PREACHING THAT ‘JESUS TURNED INTO SATAN’Pope Francis went where no other Christian, let alone Pope, had ever gone before, accusing Jesus of “debasing himself up to the point of totally annihilating himself”, and “turning into Satan.”Hardcore Francis apologists claim the quote was taken out of context, but when the passage is read in it’s entirety it is clear that Francis meant exactly what he said.Making matters worse, Pope Francis later doubled down, spreading Satanic doctrine further, when he said that Jesus Christ “made himself the devil, the serpent, for us,” according to L’Osservatore Romano, the daily newspaper of the Vatican.PREACHING THAT RELATIONSHIPS WITH JESUS ARE ‘HARMFUL’The heretical statement by Pope Francis comes after he broke with centuries of Christian tradition earlier this year, telling a crowd of 33,000 Catholics in Rome that “a personal, direct, immediate relationship with Jesus Christ” must be avoided at all costs.“Having a personal relationship with Jesus is dangerous and very harmful,” the pope said during the June 25 speech.The unconventional teachings of Pope Francis have caused Vatican Cardinals and senior priests to turn their back on the pontiff and refuse to pledge obedience to him.OPENLY CALLING FOR ‘ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT’In July this year Pope Francis told the Italian newspaper La Repubblica that the United States of America has “a distorted vision of the world” and Americans must be ruled by a world government, as soon as possible, “for their own good.”The week before he also called for “a one world government” and “political authority”, arguing that the creation of the one world government is needed to combat major issues such as “climate change.”Speaking with Ecuador’s El Universo newspaper, the Pope said that the United Nations doesnt have enough power and must be granted full governmental control “for the good of humanity.”France’s Marine Le Pen described Pope Francis as a “globalist bulldog“. Vladimir Putin argued that Francis’s unconventional teachings disqualified the Pope from calling himself a man of God. Francis’s own Cardinals are in open revolt against him, telling anybody who will listen that he was installed in unusual circumstances, with the assistance of globalist powerbrokers like George Soros.Pope Francis’s anti-Christian teachings are forcing Christians around the world to confront the difficult question – is he the false prophet that will precede the antichrist foretold in holy scripture?","The statement made by Pope Francis during Holy Mass in the Vatican on Sunday is the latest in a long line of unconventional statements uttered by the pontiff since he ascended the highest office in the Catholic Church, becoming the first jesuit pope in history.

The source exclusively revealed to Big League Politics that Sheriff Israel is also allegedly being investigated by the IRS.The high-level police source within the Sheriff’s Office disclosed that over the last several months, four candidates have been interviewed to refill the position of Broward County Sheriff. One of the candidates who were interviewed is Emery Giany, a Republican Florida law enforcement official who is closely associated with Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi.During the IG’s testimony last week, FBI director Christopher Wray was asked about the Parkland school shooting. When asked, Wray declined to answer any questions about the shooting and Sheriff Israel, citing that it was an active FBI investigation. Following the Parkland shooting, Governor Scott called for Director Wray to resign over the FBI’s failure to properly investigate Nikolas Cruz, 19, the school shooter whose plans to carry out a school shooting were reported to the FBI twice prior to the shooting on Valentine’s Day.“We constantly promote ‘see something, say something,’ and a courageous person did just that to the FBI. And the FBI failed to act. ‘See something, say something’ is an incredibly important tool and people must have confidence in the follow through from law enforcement. The FBI Director needs to resign,” Governor Scott said.According to the source in the Broward Sheriffs office, Sheriff Israel’s removal revolves around a criminal matter that the FBI is aware of. Although his failures surrounding the Parkland shooting initially sparked the investigation, it isn’t the sole reason why he is being removed.The high-level source who wished to remain anonymous told Big League Politics that Sheriff Israel is already aware of the fact that he is being removed from office next week.Sheriff Israel has been under heavy criticism for his handling of the of the Parkland school shooting, which left 17 people dead. Following the Valentine’s Day school massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, it was revealed that police officers under Sheriff Israel’s order were called to the home of the Parkland shooter 45 times prior to the school shooting.It is unclear why law enforcement officials law enforcement at the Broward County Sheriff’s office and FBI failed to properly investigate Cruz, but their massive failure has been directly attributed to the loss of 17 lives in Parkland, FL.Since the Parkland shooting, a lot of unflattering information has come out regarding Sheriff Israel. Along with being a mouthpiece for Democratic politicians and gun control advocates, like Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz who he has been photographed with, Sheriff Israel and his department have recently made headlines for more controversy.In May, it was revealed that Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school and the Broward County Sheriff’s office were keeping quiet the fact that Sheriff Israel’s son, Brett, had allegedly assaulted a 14 year old student on campus in an act of bullying.Shortly after the Parkland shooting, cell phone video filmed by Cruz himself revealed that he himself felt bullied, which lead him to carry out a massacre on February 14, 2018 in a targeted attack against his former classmates.Most recently, Sheriff Israel received a massive amount of backlash after the Broward County Sheriff’s office tweeted a picture of a new custom made Broward sheriff’s car that read, “Our new #dodge #charger. Do you like the paint job?”The tweet sparked outrage online from Republicans and Democrats alike ","36 hours after the first round of public hearings for the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission began in Tallahassee.The tweet came just days after the House Oversight Committee released a scathing report detailing the failures of the Broward County Sheriff’s office in the lead up to the Parkland shooting, including the revelation that deputies assigned to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School were ordered to stand down during the massacre.The tweet was later deleted after the public outcry.

politifact15631,1,0,"Lisa Page, former FBI lawyer under James Comey and Andrew McCabe, has become the latest rat to depart the sinking ship.According to testimony given by Page during two days of closed-door House hearings, former bosses at the FBI instructed her to cover-up the fact that China, not Russia, hacked the DNC server.Truepundit.com reports: The embattled Page tossed James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok and Bill Priestap among others under the Congressional bus, alleging the upper echelon of the FBI concealed intelligence confirming Chinese state-backed ‘assets’ had illegally acquired former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s 30,000+ “missing” emails, federal sources said.The Russians didn’t do it. The Chinese did, according to well-placed FBI sources.And while Democratic lawmakers and the mainstream media prop up Russia as America’s boogeyman, it was the ironically Chinese who acquired Hillary’s treasure trove of classified and top secret intelligence from her home-brewed private server.And a public revelation of that magnitude — publicizing that a communist world power intercepted Hillary’s sensitive and top secret emails — would have derailed Hillary Clinton’s presidential hopes. Overnight. But it didn’t simply because it was concealed.FBI bosses knew of the breach yet did nothing to investigate, seemingly trying to run out the clock on the alarming revelations to protect Hillary during her heated presidential campaign with Trump. So instead of investigating the hacking of Clinton’s server, FBI bosses sat quietly.And did nothing to confirm the Chinese assets were linked to their government. Or assess the damage such a tremendous breach posed to national security. Did the Chinese government access Hillary’s emails? The FBI didn’t care enough to investigate at the risk of besmirching Clinton and further soiling her during the election.Hundreds of top secret documents and even the president’s daily travel and security itineraries were on that server — and intercepted by a communist country — yet the FBI sat on the evidence. Likewise, all of Clinton’s and her inner circle’s outgoing emails were compromised as well, sources confirmed.Even the Inspector General had tipped off the FBI — specifically Strzok — about the foreign breach. Still, no timely case was pursued.That same cover-up pattern fits FBI bosses who time after time stalled and concealed other criminal intelligence on Clinton in the weeks prior to the election.We could write more detail here and ramble on and on but at this point, we simply ask.Is anyone going to go to prison for politicizing the FBI and covering up countless crimes committed by FBI personnel in a variety of coordinated schemes to protect Hillary and the Democrats?",When will justice be served?
politifact11773,1,0,"335 SHARES SHARE THIS STORYRepublican attacks on transgendered Americans and the religious fight to keep gender a binary delineation took a turn for the bizarre this week when Virginia Republican Mark Cole filed a bill that would force schools to check the genitals of their students in order to ensure that they are using facilities reserved for their “anatomical sex:”Local school boards shall develop and implement policies that require every school restroom, locker room, or shower room that is designated for use by a specific gender to solely be used by individuals whose anatomical sex matches such gender designation. Such policies may also provide that a student may, upon request, be granted access, to the extent reasonable, to a single stall restroom or shower, a unisex bathroom, or controlled individual use of a restroom, locker room, or shower. Any student who willfully and knowingly violates this section shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $50. Civil penalties assessed under this section shall be paid into the Literary Fund. Any law-enforcement officer may issue a summons regarding a violation of this section.He did not deign to inform us how this would be accomplished, but it’s hard to imagine any scenario that did not involve adults inspecting the genitals of children before using the bathroom. Notably, it also provides for stigmatizing transgendered children by isolating them in a single person bathroom, which the Department of Justice ruled in June was a violation of the student’s rights. It is a disgusting show of transphobia that has no place in our public schools; the GOP must accept that America is a multi-gendered, multi-ethnic nation, and no amount of perverted laws is going to change that.Download our NEW Occupy Democrats app for your iPhone by clicking here or for your Android by clicking here.Add your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the President’s crimes.

politifact13982,1,0,"Recently, Republican Ohio Gov. John Kasich vetoed the so-called “heartbeat bill,” a measure that would have banned all abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, or before many women even know that they are pregnant. At the same time, Kasich signed a bill banning abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions only for saving a pregnant woman’s life or preventing the “substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.”“At the risk of sounding discriminatory, which is not at all my goal here, but at the risk of sounding like that, there is no way women should be allowed control over whether or not they are going to have abortions,” Kasich told the Ohio Daily Star. “Women are wonderful beings, they are kind, loving, incredible and a whole other plethora of adjectives could be used to describe them, but at the end of the day, I’m sorry to have to say this, but the honest truth is that women used to be all those things. The women of today are mainly opportunists and gold diggers, who typically get pregnant due to unsafe sex, or to get their partners to marry them.”He continued, “Our mothers and women of the old times were the women every man deserved and was blessed to have. Today, the situation is so critical that I honestly fear for the future of this country. And so, I was in a position to make a change and do something important, and so I did. And there’s one very simple reason why I did it. That’s that, if a woman these days is not intelligent enough to keep her legs closed when they’re supposed to be closed, if she doesn’t have the foresight to make sure she doesn’t get herself in a situation where she might be pregnant, then there is no way a woman like that can or should be entrusted with the decision of having an abortion.”“A woman like that can barely take care of herself, and we’re supposed to tell our doctors to perform an abortion on such a woman and kill her unborn child – a being who’s done no wrong and only exists as its mother’s mistake? Do you really want to put the men and women in our healthcare in that kind of situations? To literally force them to commit manslaughter?” Kasich said. “I don’t know about the rest of the people living in my state, but I for one am not comfortable with that one bit. And so I reacted and did what was necessary to prevent that from happening.”“And I’ll tell you another thing – as of recently, all cases of out-of-wedlock pregnancies in the state of Ohio will have to be approved by the state. That means that every single couple that becomes pregnant and isn’t married or at the very least engaged, will be scrutinized to determine whether the pregnancy was planned or accidental. And in the case of the latter, the couple will be fined a total of $100,000, with $70,000 of the fine being charged on the mother-to-be for not being able to not only use birth control, but having sex before marriage in the first place. Women in this country really need to learn to either keep their legs closed or their other orifices open,” the governor concluded.","Kasich also added that “all women who are pregnant and want to have an abortion must be forced to undergo a mandatory class on the benefits of adoption.”

Now the state of California has appointed its first “unprotected” illegal alien in state office after Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de León (D-Los Angeles) appointed Lizbeth Mateo an advisory committee.The committee’s formal name is a bureaucratic mouthful — the California Student Opportunity and Access Program Project Grant Advisory Committee, or “Cal-SOAP,” for short — but its mission is one that will be familiar to Mateo: to find ways to help students from underserved communities go to collegeMateo is aa 33-year-old attorney and civil rights activist who was born in Mexico and came to the United States illegally at the age of 14 with her parents, who are also illegal aliens, according to the Sacramento Bee. She often complains that illegal aliens are treated unjustly and are not adequately represented in state government. As a result, she describes her appointment as a means towards correcting that alleged injustice.Mateo said via Fox News – “While undocumented students have become more visible in our state, they remain underrepresented in places where decisions that affect them are being made.”Trending: Melania Just Fired Them ALL! ‘That Is Not Acceptable Here – I Won’t Allow It!’Senate Bill 174 made Mateo’s appointment possible by amending existing state law to allow the appointment of any resident over the age of 18 to a civil office regardless of citizenship or immigration status. California law currently states that someone is incapable of holding office if they are not a citizen at the time of their appointment.“California is stronger when we utilize talents of all our residents, and opening state and local boards and commissions to every Californian will allow us to better serve our diverse communities,” Sen. Ricardo Lara, D-Bell Gardens, and the bill’s author said in a statement. “Undocumented Californians are our neighbors, co-workers, and parents, and as lawmakers, we can’t make good policy if their voices are left out of the discussion.”It marked the first time the Senate appointed someone living within the borders of the United States illegally to a state post.

politifact15371,1,1,"President Trump and his administration just voted against a United Nations ban on the death penalty for being gay, making the United States of America (it’s hard to think this is actually really happening) just one of 13 other countries in the world to oppose such a historic vote.A few other notable countries who voted against the ban were China, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, and Egypt.The resolution wasn’t sought to ban the death penalty entirely, but instead to keep it from being imposed in a ‘discriminatory manner,’ particularly in six countries where the death penalty is used for people known to be in same-sex relationships: Iran, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Yemen, Nigeria, and Somalia.While some are saying that a ‘no’ vote might imply a rejection of the death penalty in general, The Human Rights Council resolution specifically stated that it condemned the “imposition of the death penalty as a sanction for specific forms of conduct, such as apostasy, blasphemy, adultery and consensual same-sex relations.”To have a ‘no’ vote puts the United States in a very select group of countries. Not exactly the best group to be in agreement with on an issue like this.Renato Sabbadini, the executive director of The International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, said:“It is unconscionable to think that there are hundreds of millions of people living in states where somebody may be executed simply because of whom they love.” “This is a monumental moment where the international community has publicly highlighted that these horrific laws simply must end.”Since taking office, Trump has made a number of political appointments and policy moves against the LGBT community, including:Having The Department of Justice and Department of Education rescind guidance that defended the rights of transgender students to safety use bathrooms at schools that correspond to their gender identity.Saying publicly that transgenders could no longer serve in the military, and then issuing a directive to the Department of Defense to implement such an order.Signing an executive order in March that rescinded an Obama-era rule that companies have to prove they treat LGBT employees fairly.Fortunately, the measure passed with 27 countries voting for it, but it still sends a chilling message about a new United States agenda on human rights.","President Trump and his administration’s vote against the U.N. ban on the death penalty for being gay is just one of several anti-LGBT actions that have been taken since he took office.The vote is being seen as a “chilling message” about the new U.S. agenda on human rights.

politifact14565,1,0,"The NFL may refuse to listen when Donald Trump says that until players stop disrespecting our national anthem, our veterans, and our flag, team owners should fire people, but Fox Sports is helping him send the message.Pointing out that “NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN” because Americans “love our country” and have been avoiding them ever since Colin Kaepernick and his friends have been kneeling during the National Anthem, Trump suggested Americans as a whole boycott games.If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag & Country, you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2017Fox Sports took things a step farther Sunday morning with a bombshell announcement that until players either stop disrespecting our country or are fired to do so, they will not be airing any games.“President Trump is right that this has gone on for far too long,” Fox Sports spokeswoman Holly McGee told Fox And Friends Sunday. “We are standing with him and refusing to air the games until the 12 teams who have attacked the President apologize and players who disrespect our nation are punished.”“I have to ask, what are we kneeling for at this point?” host Brian Kilmeade said later in the segment. “Because you talk about social injustice, this is the least sexist, least racist, most free, most equal, most prosperous country in the history of humankind.”NFL fans would be wise to call their favorite teams and urge them to get rid of players who hate our country.","The NFL is hurting itself by not taking a stand against this.”I think they’re doing it out of fear of the backlash from the players, the owners, and the media, but it’s not right,” Kilmeade said. “You’re talking about a president who is one of the most pro-military presidents we’ve had in modern history.”Fox News host Pete Hegseth also criticized the NFL on Sunday, saying “it’s time for owners to stand up” and address the issue of players disrespecting the flag.The NFL is a multi-billion dollar business that has the power to make a real impact on social issues. It’s time for them to use that power for good. If they don't, they will lose a lot of fans and revenue. — Pete Hegseth (@petehegseth) September 24, 2017The NFL has been facing widespread backlash after several players took a knee or raised fists during the national anthem in protest of police brutality and racial injustice.Trump has been a vocal critic of the protests and has called for players who kneel during the anthem to be fired.The NFL has since announced that it will not force teams to punish players for kneeling during the anthem, but individual teams have taken their own actions.

Paraphrased: Fox Sports has taken a bold step by announcing that they will not air any NFL games until players stop disrespecting the country and the flag, and until the teams who have been attacking the President apologize. The network's spokeswoman, Holly McGee, stated that until the players who disrespect the nation are punished, they will not air any games. Fox News hosts, Pete Hegseth and Brian Kilmeade, have also criticized the NFL, saying that it is hurting itself by not taking a stand against the players who disrespect the flag. They believe that the NFL has the power to make a real impact on social issues, and that it's time for the owners to stand up and address the issue. If the NFL does not take action, they will lose a lot of fans and revenue."

Mr. Netanyahu is said to be rallying moderate Arabs to thwart Mr. Obama’s bid to become the Secretary-General of the United Nations after he leaves the White House next year.Mr. Obama has already discussed the issue with Republican, Democratic and Jewish officials in the United States, according to Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Jarida.Mr. Netanyahu recently is said to have gotten wind of Obama’s plans which he calls the Obama Project. “Wasn’t eight years of having Obama in office enough?” Mr. Netanyahu is quoted in the Kuwaiti daily as telling associates. “Eight years during which he ignored Israel? And now he wants to be in a position that is liable to cause us hardships in the international arena.”Townhall.com reports: Further gripes Israel has with President Obama include the U.S. “moving closer to the Muslim Brotherhood, toppling the regime of Hosni Mubarak, and attempts to ally itself with political Islam,” the paper quotes a Netanyahu aide as saying.U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon’s term expires in early 2017, making Obama’s bid for the position a possibility.Last year after his speech at West Point, some pointed out that he sounded an awful lot like he was campaigning for the role.","At the time, the White House dismissed the notion.Now, it appears that the rumors were true. In his final year as president, Mr. Obama is making moves to further his globalist agenda, and it seems that he’s not going to let a little thing like leaving office get in his way.Mr. Netanyahu’s bid to thwart Obama’s plans is reportedly being backed by moderate Arab states, who are said to be unhappy with Obama’s handling of the Syrian conflict and his efforts to broker a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians.According to Israel’s Channel 2 News, Mr. Netanyahu is working to rally moderate Arab states to block Mr. Obama’s bid for the top U.N. post.

politifact14818,1,0,"Before the Obama administration approved a controversial deal in 2010 giving Moscow control of a large swath of American uranium, the FBI had gathered substantial evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering designed to grow Vladimir Putin’s atomic energy business inside the United States, according to government documents and interviews.Federal agents used a confidential U.S. witness working inside the Russian nuclear industry to gather extensive financial records, make secret recordings and intercept emails as early as 2009 that showed Moscow had compromised an American uranium trucking firm with bribes and kickbacks in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, FBI and court documents show.They also obtained an eyewitness account — backed by documents — indicating Russian nuclear officials had routed millions of dollars to the U.S. designed to benefit former President Bill Clinton William (Bill) Jefferson ClintonBill Clinton's novel sees fastest fiction sales in two years From Singapore, skepticism and hope The Memo: Summit gives Trump political boost — with risks MORE’s charitable foundation during the time Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonSessions defends firing Comey, warns DOJ report could prompt more terminations Sanders gets best reception at early 2020 audition Hillicon Valley: DHS gets new cyber chief | White House warns lawmakers not to block ZTE deal | White nationalists find home on Google Plus | Comcast outbids Disney for Fox | Anticipation builds for report on FBI Clinton probe MORE served on a government body that provided a favorable decision to Moscow, sources told The Hill.The racketeering scheme was conducted “with the consent of higher level officials” in Russia who “shared the proceeds” from the kickbacks, one agent declared in an affidavit years later.ADVERTISEMENTRather than bring immediate charges in 2010, however, the Department of Justice (DOJ) continued investigating the matter for nearly four more years, essentially leaving the American public and Congress in the dark about Russian nuclear corruption on U.S. soil during a period when the Obama administration made two major decisions benefiting Putin’s commercial nuclear ambitions.The first decision occurred in October 2010, when the State Department and government agencies on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States unanimously approved the partial sale of Canadian mining company Uranium One to the Russian nuclear giant Rosatom, giving Moscow control of more than 20 percent of America’s uranium supply.When this sale was used by Trump on the campaign trail last year, Hillary Clinton’s spokesman said she was not involved in the committee review and noted the State Department official who handled it said she “never intervened ... on any [Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States] matter.”In 2011, the administration gave approval for Rosatom’s Tenex subsidiary to sell commercial uranium to U.S. nuclear power plants in a partnership with the United States Enrichment Corp. Before then, Tenex had been limited to selling U.S. nuclear power plants reprocessed uranium recovered from dismantled Soviet nuclear weapons under the 1990s Megatons to Megawatts peace program.“The Russians were compromising American contractors in the nuclear industry with kickbacks and extortion threats, all of which raised legitimate national security concerns.

politifact15540,1,0,"Among the far-left liberal owners of the Red Hen Restaurant in Lexington, Virginia apparently did not learn her lesson once she chose to throw Sarah Huckabee Sanders out of her restaurant on Friday evening, then coming under assault of a complete army of”Deplorables.”Regardless of all the backlash, Stephanie Wilkinson has doubled down and is now claiming she does not repent what she did Friday.All this mess started when Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, together with her Husband along with six other friends decided to go out to dinner this past Friday night in the Red Hen Restaurant.As Sanders along with the rest inside her celebration nibbled in what we can only surmise as mediocre crackers and cheese, the owner of the restaurant has been called to the institution where she asked Sanders to return to the terrace with her.When they got to the patio Wilkerson told her the restaurant had”certain criteria” like”honesty, and empathy, and collaboration.” So she asked Sanders to depart.She agreed because Sanders is a lady. She gathered up her stuff and left, together with the rest of her celebration.Vice noted:But despite all the backlash she’s gotten from the right, Stephanie Wilkinson says she does not regret a thing.“We simply felt there are moments in time when folks need to live their own convictions. This appeared to be one.”When Sanders came to the Red Hen along with her husband along with six other people on Friday night, the boxer called Wilkinson to mention the team was”a little concerned,” Wilkinson told the Post.She headed to the restaurant, and–while Sanders and her friends munched on cheeseboards–called the team to a huddle in the kitchen, and asked if they wanted Sanders to leave. According to the Article, a handful of her workers are gay, and many others are revulsed by Sanders’ treatment of this emergency at the boundary. They wanted her gone.Wilkinson took Sanders out into the patio and asked her to leave, telling her why the restaurant had”certain criteria” like”honesty, and compassion, and collaboration,” Wilkinson told the Post. Sanders agreed to proceed, gathered up her things, and headed out, followed by the remainder of her party, whose meal Wilkinson comped.Following the White House Press Secretary identified the place by name on Twitter, President Trump called it”filthy,” and a army of his assistants got busy screwing with its business–beginning a campaign to make a bunch of bogus dinner reservations and tanking its score on Yelp.I always had a guideline, if a restaurant is filthy on the outside, it’s dirty on the inside!The restaurant’s Yelp page has been bombarded with over 11,000 one-star reviews, leaving it in a sound one-and-a-half.Piggybacking on Trump’s dig on the area being”filthy,” several pissed-off reviewers have claimed to have discovered roaches in their food because Sanders was kicked out, but some have compared Wilkinson to a Nazi and called her and her staff”un-American hateful bigots.”“I’ve a company, and I want the company to flourish. This feels just like the moment in our democracy when people need to make uncomfortable actions and decisions to maintain their morals.”Saturday afternoon the Press Secretary hadn’t any difficulty in telling her story and actually named the establishment on Twitter, which was followed by President Trump calling it”filthy” on his Twitter page.Which in turn led to a military people deplorables wasting no time whatsoever in creating our feelings heard on social networking, on Yelp and by creating fake dinner reservations in demonstration. The Restaurant’s Yelp page currently has the company at one star and a half.While on the other side, liberals were pleased to leave this slum a 5-star rating although they threw a hissy fit every time a Christian baker didn’t need to bake a cake for a homosexual wedding a few years back.Wilkerson went on to confirm to the Article she feels like this is the moment in our democracy when people have to make uncomfortable decisions a","kin to living their own convictions.She added that the”system has not worked for a very long time” and that the place is doing what it needs to do to continue its company.The Red Hen Restaurant in Lexington, Virginia is a far-left liberal restaurant, run by Stephanie Wilkinson, the place Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked to leave on Friday night."

politifact14310,1,0,"By AM Conservative Post authorFareed Zakaria, CNN host of ‘Foreign Affairs,’ has in his private blog called for the merciless rape of white females by Islamic minority groups shortly after openly gloating over the rise in premature deaths of white males in his article in The Washington Post.Zakaria’s blog post unapologetically calls to increase the death rate of white Middle America by systematically targeting Caucasian females.“The white race is rightfully failing because it is a foolish, arrogant, and self-absorbed ethnicity that has racism infused into its very genes. While the sharp incline of the death rate of white males is a good start, the solution to the ‘white question’ will not be reached until there is a sharp decline in the population of white females as well. Much more needs to be done in this regard if this country is ever to advance from its ignorant backwardness towards being an actually inhabitable nation.Thankfully, the Prophet Muhammad has given us a foolproof way to speed up the decline of a vanquished nation by treating their women as our sex slaves. They may try and fight the unstoppable tide, but their resistance will grow only weaker as the white race loses its ability to keep its head above water. We may yet see some final convulsions before white Middle America is decreased to a manageable number where it can be more easily controlled.”The blog post was removed from Zakaria’s blog within a few hours, after it began to receive negative attention.CNN officials have refused to take action against their employee.“Every death of a white person brings tears of joy to my eyes,” Zakaria posted on his Twitter account shortly after having to remove his blog post, in what is believed to be a passive-aggressive response to his critics.Photo Credit: World Economic Forum","/ Flickr (CC by 2.0)

He converted to Islam two years ago.However, what those reports don’t mention is that the would-be terrorist also ‘liked’ numerous Antifa pages, suggesting he supported the movement.Jameson liked Berkeley Antifa, Antifa California, Antifa Scaramento and White Rose Antifa Portland, an archived version of his Facebook profile confirms.He also liked a number of other far-left pages, including ‘Trump Resistance Movement’, ‘Things Trump Supporters Say’, ‘US Democratic Socialists’, ‘Progressive Politics’, and ‘Jeremy Corbyn’.Some of Jameson’s favorite news organisations were The Young Turks, CNN, BuzzFeed and Al Jazeera. He also liked a number of pro-vegan pages.The jihadist also sympathised with a number of pro-Muslim pages, including ‘Documenting Oppression Against Muslims, ‘Islam – Religion of Peace’ and ‘Stunning Hijabs’, as well as numerous anti-Israel activist pages.Jameson’s Facebook likes confirm that his political leanings were a mixture of radical far-left ideology and Islamism.As we have documented, ISIS has previously attempted to reach out to those on the far-left as part of an attempt to create militant offshoot cells within the United States and Western Europe.A passage from the ISIS manifesto Black Flags from Rome entitled ‘European Muslims allying with Left-Wing activists’ details a plan to recruit those on the far left because they broadly share the same goals as radical Islamists.During the anti-Trump inauguration riots back in January, one Antifa supporter was seen displaying an ISIS flag and beheading videos on his phone in an effort to intimidate Trump supporters in Washington, DC.According to a recently revealed FBI field report, Antifa supporters have stored improvised explosives on college campuses.

The system they use is called Global Forecast System (GFS).At 2:00 this afternoon, Friday, September 1, the GFS model spit out its projection of Hurricane IRMA’s path over the next 12 days. This model shows the utterly terrifying projected path of Hurricane IRMA coming right up the east coast, and making landfall in NEW YORK HARBOR as a Category 5 Hurricane, with winds in excess of 157 MPH.I am not a weather expert. I do not profess to have any idea at all about the accuracy of these computer models. As a layman, I know the models can turn out to be wrong.

The controversial changes are said to be part of a major overhaul of the UK’s welfare system, which could see millions of people affected.Sources close to the White House claim that the changes are being designed to “reduce costs” and “increase efficiency” in the UK’s welfare system. The UK government has denied that any such changes are being considered, but the allegations have sparked concern among politicians and campaigners who fear that the proposals could have a devastating impact on some of the country’s most vulnerable citizens.CommentsCommentsPowered by"
politifact15178,1,0,"George W. Bush has lobbed thinly-veiled critiques of President Donald Trump on his approach to the press and the travel ban from some Muslim-majority countries. | AP Photo Former presidents walk fine line in Trump’s America Trump's predecessors are trying to both defend their legacies and respect the unwritten rule of not undermining the current commander in chief.During his “American carnage” inaugural address, President Donald Trump sent a clear message: all of the presidents in recent memory have failed the American people.The harsh rhetoric of Trump’s inaugural address made an impression on his predecessors, with George W. Bush reportedly calling it “some weird s--t” and Jimmy Carter saying he “flinched” when Trump appeared to back off America's commitment to human rights.Story Continued BelowIn Trump’s America, the five living former presidents are walking a fine line, attempting to defend their legacies while also trying to respect the “unwritten rule” that former presidents avoid undermining their successors.“The immediate former presidents have been more active in their criticism of the current president,” George C. Edwards, a presidential historian at Texas A&M, said. “This kind of thing has been going on throughout history, but normally it’s not very much. This is very early in a tenure and to have former presidents being critical of the president… is pretty unusual.”As Obama returns to the public spotlight, his former aides have made it clear he has no intention of talking much about Trump. However, he’s made his displeasure clear.Obama, who campaigned heavily for Hillary Clinton, said he was “heartened” by the protests following Trump’s immigration ban targeting Muslim-majority countries. He also released a lengthy statement defending the Affordable Care Act against Trump’s attempts to repeal it.At a speech in Boston on Sunday night, Obama avoided mentioning Trump by name, but again forcefully defended his signature health care legislation and mentioned immigration reform. “I expect to be busy, if not with a second career, at least a second act,” Obama said Sunday.And on Monday, Obama’s aides aggressively pushed back against Trump for trying to blame his predecessor for the woes associated with Trump’s disgraced former national security adviser Michael Flynn. While Trump and White House press secretary Sean Spicer have repeatedly denounced Obama for not revoking Flynn’s security clearance, Obama aides told reporters that Obama tried to warn Trump about Flynn’s erratic nature.George W. Bush, meanwhile, has lobbed thinly veiled critiques of Trump on his approach to the press and the travel ban from some Muslim-majority countries. “I consider the media to be indispensable to democracy,” Bush said in an interview with “Today” in February. “We need an independent media to hold people like me to account.”As for the travel ban, Bush was restrained but clear in his concern. “I am for an immigration policy that's welcoming and upholds the law,” Bush said.Carter also voiced concerns after Trump’s inauguration. During an early April appearance at Emory University, he said he wanted to avoid addressing politics but he hoped the women’s movement would be “invigorated” by Trump and that he didn’t see “any glimmer of hope” from the administration on race and gender issues.Bill Clinton, who was harshly critical of Trump during the Manhattan businessman’s presidential campaign, didn’t mince words about Trump when he ran into a local newspaper editor while holiday shopping. “He doesn’t know much,” Clinton said in late December. “One thing he does know is how to get angry white men to vote for him.”George H.W. Bush, who has been in and out of the hospital, remains the only living president to avoid any political commentary.Criticism of the current president by former presidents is not completely unprecedented, however. For example, Herbert Hoover criticized Franklin D. Roosevelt, his successor.“We’ve seen some criticism already of th","to do anything to help the current president, then you might start to wonder whether there’s something going on here.”In the end, the living former presidents’ willingness to speak out could be seen as an attempt to defend the office they held and the legacy they left behind, said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University. “It’s not just about Trump, it’s about the office of the presidency,” he said. “They want to protect it and honor it.”With the current president’s approval rating hovering around 40 percent, it’s not hard to see why the living former presidents might feel compelled to speak out. But for now, the former presidents are walking a fine line, trying to maintain their own legacies and respecting the unwritten rule of not undermining the current commander in chief.Story Continued Below Share on Twitter read more"

He and other right-wing commentators were following in the footsteps of a tradition dating back to the 1950s and the far-right John Birch Society, which claimed a communist conspiracy was hell-bent on taking “the Christ out of Christmas,” also blaming ""fantatics"" at the UN for trying to ""poison the 1959 Christmas season with their high-pressure propaganda."">>Ex-Marine who plotted San Francisco Christmas attack claims he was angry about Trump 'giving Jerusalem to the Jews'skip - Trump Christmas tweetThis is your land, this is your home, and it's your voice that matters the most.

While many politicians are as spineless and weak as can be, such as Merkel, Macron, and London’s Mayor, some are standing up to the atrocity that is Islamic Extremism.In an incredible turn of events, 139 out of 168 deputies voted in favor of an amendment which would allow citizens to carry guns and shoot terrorists on sight. “We do not want to disarm our own people at a time when the security situation is deteriorating,” Interior Minister Milan Chovanec said on Wednesday.Sputnik News, a news agency centered in Moscow, reports:“The new law states that Czech citizens have the right to acquire, keep and bear arms in order to ensure the security of the state.”“It means that the approximately 360,000 licensed gun-owners in the Czech Republic are allowed to carry their weapons in public and use them in case of a public order emergency, such as terrorism.”Millions of patriotic men and women are PROUD to stand with the Czech Republic, fearing that if we don’t take action, Islam will soon overtake our nation. Some of the more pathetic and pandering individuals, however, have criticized the new law.The Guardian compares the law to Hitler:“There is little to smile about, however, when Zeman sets out what he sees as the threat being posed by radical Islamists – and even “moderate” Muslims, who he says could be radicalised to commit terror attacks as ordinary Germans were once inspired to fanatically back Hitler.”Yes, that’s right—because apparently Leftists think that protecting your nation from a cult of death, that rapes women, stones gays, and beheads thieves, is somehow “intolerant.” Well do you know what most Americans think?You’re damn right it’s intolerant! Why the HELL should we be tolerant of a barbaric religion that wants to take us back to the 500’s AD? We shouldn’t! We value freedom and family, and we WILL NOT have our country overrun by Islam.Thankfully, despite the overwhelming Leftist propaganda claiming that the law is “unfair,” and “discriminates,” against Muslims, conservatives all across the world have had their morale boosted.Despite what liberals may say about gun safety issues, The Czech Republic is actually one of the safest nations out there—6th safest in the world, to be exact.“Although Western European countries such as France, Belgium, Germany and the UK have suffered several terrorist attacks in recent years, the Czech Republic has not seen any attacks. The Global Peace Index 2016 ranked the country the sixth safest in the world.”After the past decade of liberal policies, pandering to immigrants, and welcoming terrorists into our country with open arms, many are proud to see that Europe is beginning to stand up for itself. Hope may not be lost, after all.With the massive movement of grass-roots nationalism growing, from Nigel Farage and Brexit, to Donald Trump, to various countries exiting the EU and valuing their OWN citizens and heritage over others, it seems that Western Civilization has a fighting chance of surviving.","Hopefully, other countries will follow in the Czech Republic’s footsteps and protect their citizens, their values, and their cultures. Otherwise, the future of Europe and the world is looking grim.Some may criticize the law as “Islamophobic” or “racist,” but the truth is that the Czechs are simply recognizing the reality of the threat that Islam poses to their nation. They are not trying to discriminate against Muslims, but rather, they are trying to protect their own citizens. As the old saying goes, “better safe than sorry.”

politifact15268,1,0,"Update:The Syrian Arab Red Crescent statement was reported, and at the time we had no reason to believe it was not true. Subsequent questions have emerged, however, and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent is saying they are unaware of such a statement having ever been issued by the Syrian branch. They further say the Syrian Red Crescent was shut down in Douma effective April 7.—The Syrian Red Crescent issued a statement Monday dismissing the allegations of a weekend chemical weapon attack in the city of Douma. The statement insisted their medical personnel in the city had found no evidence any such attack took place.The Syrian Red Crescent said their hospital in Douma received six patients complaining of respiratory problems, but said they didn’t seem to have any physical problems at all, nor was there any trace of any chemical agents they might’ve been exposed to.(This has been retracted, it is incorrect.)Chemical attack or no, it wouldn’t be surprising for some people to complain of symptoms without actually having any problems. That the Red Crescent operates a hospital in a city supposedly inundated with wounded and didn’t get a single patient with confirmed exposure, however, is very noteworthy.The Russian Defense Ministry also reported that their own medics had examined some patients in Douma, and had the same result, that none showed signs of chemical poisoning. With White Helmets claiming scores killed and over 500 wounded by exposure, it seems impossible to believe that if it was true no one can find any of these “real” patients to confirm an attack.Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",", one of the best journalists out there."

Is it a reputable news organisation or a blog with a small readership?3. Check the evidence. Is there a link to a credible source, or is it just an opinion piece?4. Check the language. Fake news often uses emotive language and sensational headlines to grab attention.5. Check the overall tone. Fake news often has a biased or extreme tone, and may be written to provoke a strong reaction.6. Check the comments.

Either rising sea temperatures and depleted fish stocks possibly led the shark to adventure itself further into the Great Lakes region.” he admits, visibly puzzled. “It is also possible it traveled to the region through underwater tunnels that interconnect between the Great Lakes,” he told reporters.According to authorities more than a hundred people reported missing in the area in the last decade may have fallen under the fangs of the gigantic beast, several local residents even suspecting its presence for a long time.U.S. Coast Guards reassured local residents that the occurrence of such a predator in the region’s waters “is highly unlikely” as sharks are not well adapted to freshwater systems.In 1916, a deadly shark attack near Presque Ile beach, in Lake Eerie, made national headlines, forcing local authorities to ban swimming in the region for over 14 years until the ban was lifted in 1930.","The shark was believed to have been a white shark, which is known to have caused more than 200 attacks on humans over the years.

politifact15262,1,0,"One of the most contentious issues in the State of Missouri’s case against Gov. Eric Greitens has been the whereabouts of an incriminating photo that he is alleged to have taken and disseminated.A deposition of the woman (K.S.) in question, the woman who accused Greitens of taking a nude photo of her, reveals one new shocking bit of evidence. The woman may have dreamed up the incident at the heart of the criminal case.The defense team’s April 8 motion to compel immediate production of all exculpatory evidence reports the following exchange.When the defense counsel asked K.S., “Did you ever see [Greitens] in possession of a camera or phone?” she answered: “Not to my knowledge. I didn’t see him with it.”The question was then asked, “And as you sit here now, you cannot state under oath that you ever saw him in possession of a camera – with a camera or a phone?”K.S. replied, “Correct.”The counsel then asked, “And you can’t say you saw it on his person, you can’t say you saw him put it down in the kitchen, take it from the kitchen, or put it down anywhere in the basement. Those are all correct statements, are they not?”K.S. answered, “Yes. I cannot say.”Trying to salvage the state’s case, the Assistant Circuit Attorney later asked K.S., “Did you see what you believed to be a phone?”Here comes the shocker. K.S. answered, “… I haven’t talked about it because I don’t know if it’s because I’m remembering it through a dream or I – I’m not sure, but yes, I feel like I saw it after that happened, but I haven’t spoken about it because of that.”K.S. remembered the photo incident “through a dream”? Memories recovered through dreams have led to some of the great injustices in recent jurisprudence. To her credit, K.S. struggled to give honest answers to the questions she was asked, but her honesty has undone the remaining threads of a quickly unraveling case.As the defense counsel observed in the motion, the state was aware that recovered memories may have accounted for K.S.’s recollection, but state prosecutors failed to turn that obviously exculpatory evidence over to the defense. K.S. also failed to so share this revelation with the House committee investigating Greitens.Defense counsel insists that there is additional exculpatory evidence the prosecution has yet to turn over to the defense and has asked the court to order Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner to produce it.","With the trial scheduled to begin next week, the defense team will likely make the exculpatory evidence issue an issue at trial."
politifact14155,1,0,"HERE Is WHAT WILL HAPPEN If The DEEP STATE TAKES DOWN PRESIDENT TRUMP & It’s NOT PRETTY … FOR THEM“The tree of liberty must be refreshed with the blood of patriots and tyrants.” – Thomas JeffersonELDER PATRIOT – Corrupt politicians ignore Jefferson’s directive to their own detriment. It’s no longer political, it’s personal.Americans have had their eyes opened by the ascension of Donald Trump and no amount of leftwing money can put the Freedom Movement genie back in the bottle.Conservative Senator Ted Cruz made that observation after reviewing the results of the 2016 elections and the expectations of the voters.Cruz, who had the most high profile personality clash with Donald Trump during the Republican primary process nevertheless embraced Trump’s America First agenda and said, “If we’re given the White House and both houses of Congress and we don’t deliver, I think there will be pitchforks and torches in the streets. And I think quite rightly.”Candidate Trump promised many things – border control, lower taxes, fairer trade relations, a balanced budget, healthcare that puts the people first not the government, safer communities, and – to the extent possible – an end to foreign wars. What, among those promises, should any Republican, nay any American, have a problem with?After four months without a single legislative achievement, Congressional and Senatorial Republicans – notably John McCain, Paul Ryan and Lindsey Graham – have joined the Democrats in investigating President Trump absent a single shred of evidence that an underlying crime has been committed.So, what gives?Well, there was one additional promise that Trump made on his way to the White House that has some Republicans joining with Democrats and quaking in their boots, Trump’s promise to “Drain the Swamp.”As we reported yesterday, “An F.B.I. agent with ‘intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the Clinton case’ told us that they uncovered evidence of such massive corruption that the agents involved realized that damned near the entire government could be brought down.”The criminal co-conspirators in both parties realized almost immediately that the new sheriff wasn’t interested in joining them in the swamp so they launched, what can only be characterized as, a coup attempt.Democrats are well schooled in such things probably because of their close alliance with Marxist regimes that can only gain power by seizing it through bloody civil wars. It should be noted that the Democratic Party has already done this once before.One Hundred and Fifty-Seven years ago the Democrats waged a war against the First Republican President Abraham Lincoln for giving Blacks their freedom. That war came at a high price, as many as 700,000 Americans died fighting for what they believe in. To put that in perspective, these casualties exceed the nation’s loss in all its other wars, from the Revolution through Vietnam.Today, Americans are still prepared to fight and die to protect their children’s God-given freedoms. Despite what you are reading and hearing in the mainstream media, they aren’t the leftwing-funded rioters, the pussy hat-wearing feminists, or the cuck bois that cant handle a micro aggression. No, the Americans that back Donald Trump are well armed.Donald Trump’s presidency will move forward politically lest the sixty million patriots who voted for him, that are comprised of the large majority of military voters, police, and NRA members, move it forward by force.These patriots are armed, trained, prepared, and have proven their discipline. They have grown disgusted by the corruption in Washington and will do whatever is necessary to make sure Trump’s Freedom Agenda moves forward and under the direction of Donald Trump himself.No amount of fake news based on unsubstantiated charges by unnamed sources is going to change that. The battle lines have been drawn and no amount of finger pointing is going to convince these patriots to let anyone overturn the election results.So why a","for Trump’s impeachment on the White House website. But it was never taken seriously.The Democrats’ obsession with impeachment is a double-edged sword. The public is not keen on it. While some are outraged by Trump’s actions, others are not. And those who are might not be all that enthusiastic about the Democrats’ efforts.Impeachment is a political act. It requires a majority vote in the House of Representatives and a two-thirds vote in the Senate to remove a president from office. It’s a high bar to clear, and there are no guarantees of success.While impeachment is an option, the more pressing issue is to ensure that President Trump’s agenda is implemented and that he is re-elected in 2020. The American people elected Trump to drain the swamp, and he needs to continue to work towards that goal. The Democrats need to stop obstructing his efforts and start working with him to make America great again. They need to remember that the American people spoke in 2016 and they need to respect the results of that election.

Elder Patriot – In the passage above, the author presents a well-reasoned argument that suggests the possibility of violence if the Deep State, which includes elements of the FBI, CIA, and other federal agencies, successfully removes President Trump from office.

The author is not calling for violence, but rather pointing out the potential consequences if the Deep State succeeds in its efforts to overturn the 2016 election results.

The author is suggesting that the American people, who overwhelmingly support President Trump, would not stand idly by if their elected president is removed from office through unconstitutional means.

The author is also pointing out that the American people are well-armed, trained, and prepared to defend their freedom and the results of the 2016 election.

politifact13973,1,1,"In Tbilisi, the two-room rented apartment Mr. Latsabidze shares with his younger brother is an unlikely offshore outpost of America’s fake news industry. The two brothers, both computer experts, get help from a third young Georgian, an architect.They say they have no keen interest in politics themselves and initially placed bets across the American political spectrum and experimented with show business news, too. They set up a pro-Clinton website, walkwithher.com, a Facebook page cheering Bernie Sanders and a web digest of straightforward political news plagiarized from The New York Times and other mainstream news media.But those sites, among the more than a dozen registered by Mr. Latsabidze, were busts. Then he shifted all his energy to Mr. Trump. His flagship pro-Trump website, departed.co, gained remarkable traction in a crowded field in the prelude to the Nov. 8 election thanks to steady menu of relentlessly pro-Trump and anti-Clinton stories. (On Wednesday, a few hours after The New York Times met with Mr. Latsabidze to ask him about his activities, the site vanished along with his Facebook page.)“My audience likes Trump,” he said. “I don’t want to write bad things about Trump. If I write fake stories about Trump, I lose my audience.”Some of his Trump stories are true, some are highly slanted and others are totally false, like one this summer reporting that “the Mexican government announced they will close their borders to Americans in the event that Donald Trump is elected President of the United States.” Data compiled by Buzzfeed showed that the story was the third most-trafficked fake story on Facebook from May to July.So successful was the formula that others in Georgia and other faraway lands joined in, too, including Nika Kurdadze, a college acquaintance of Mr. Latsabidze’s who set up his own pro-Trump site, newsbreakshere.com. Its recent offerings included a fake report headlined: “Stop it Liberals…Hillary Lost the Popular Vote by Several Million. Here’s Why.” That story, like most of Mr. Latsabidze’s work, was pilfered from the web.Mr. Latsabidze initially ran into no problems from all his cutting and pasting of other people’s stories, and he even got ripped off himself when a rival in India hijacked a pro-Trump Facebook page he had set up to drive traffic to his websites. (He said that the Indian rival had offered $10,000 to buy the page, but that he had reneged on payment after being provided with access rights and commandeered it for himself.)","But now Facebook has changed its rules and is cracking down on fake news. Mr. Latsabidze’s sites are still up, but he said he has little hope of making money from them. He and his brothers are looking for new opportunities to make their mark. He is thinking of starting a business and maybe even moving away from Georgia.

Please paraphrase: Two brothers who are computer experts in Tbilisi, Georgia, have created a fake news industry by creating pro-Clinton and pro-Trump websites, a Facebook page cheering Bernie Sanders, and a web digest of straightforward political news plagiarized from mainstream news media. The brothers got help from a third young Georgian who is an architect. They started with no political interest and experimented with show business news. However, their pro-Trump website, departed.co, gained traction in the crowded field of fake news, thanks to a steady menu of pro-Trump and anti-Clinton stories. Some of their stories are true, some are highly slanted, and others are totally false. They have also been copied by others in Georgia and other faraway lands. The brothers' sites are still up, but they have little hope of making money from them, and they are looking for new opportunities to make their mark."
politifact14893,1,0,"President Donald Trump has only been in office for a short time and he’s already caused so much anxiety to the country, including the intelligence community. Instead of continuing to be a punching bag though, one intelligence agency decided to fight back and they just sent Trump a message: they are watching him. In a twist right out of a Hollywood film, six White House staffers were escorted out of the White House for failing their background investigations. Here’s what WJ just reported:“The staffers were escorted from the White house Wednesday for problems with their SF86 application, the ‘Questionnaire for National Security Positions.’ The 127-page document includes questions on the applicant’s credit score, medical records, employment history, family history, substance use and other personal subjects.”The six staffers included the daughter of President Trump’s Florida campaign manager Caroline Wiles:“Wiles, who resigned Friday before the background check was completed, was appointed deputy assistant secretary before the inauguration in January. She will instead get a job at the Treasury Department, sources told Politico.”The form, called the SF86, is for anyone who is applying for a sensitive position in the U.S government. Depending on the level of clearance and the agency requesting it, information collected can go all the way back to the age of 18 and in some instances, a polygraph exam is required. Both the FBI and the CIA require polygraph exams for top secret positions.It’s striking that Trump had already employed individuals who had not yet passed background investigations. It shouldn’t be surprising then that intelligence agencies are refusing to share information with his administration:“Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, said in an interview with The Journal that the intelligence community considered protecting its sources and the people cultivating them to be ‘their most sacred obligation.’ Schiff added, referring to Trump: ‘I’m sure there are people in the community who feel they don’t know where he’s coming from on Russia.'”Just as was the case with Michael Flynn who just recently resigned over his shady ties to Russia, you can bet that this administration is being closely watched.Featured Photo by Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images",.

politifact14384,1,0,"Photo: Pete Marovich/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesPeter Strzok, the FBI agent who sent anti-Trump messages to a colleague while leading the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s emails and Russia’s involvement in the Trump campaign, has said he’s willing to testify before the House Judiciary Committee, or any other committee that wants to talk with him. This could lead to dramatic hearings, as Strzok could expose more information about those probes, and is central to President Trump’s effort to discredit Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.Reports last week indicated that House Judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte was preparing to subpoena Strzok as part of the House investigation into the FBI’s conduct during the 2016 election. Strzok’s lawyer, Aitan Goelman, said in a letter to Goodlatte released Sunday that the move would be unnecessary, as Strzok “intends to voluntarily appear and testify before your committee and any other Congressional committee that invites him.”The letter noted that Strzok cooperated fully with the DOJ inspector general, who issued a report last week that was highly critical of the agent. In the lead-up to the 2016 election Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who were having an affair, exchanged anti-Trump messages on their FBI-issued phones. In one, Page asked if Trump might become president and Strzok replied, “No. No he won’t. We’ll stop it.” The inspector general found no evidence connecting their views with “specific investigative decisions,” but said that comment and others “implies a willingness to take official action.”Strzok and Page said he meant Trump wouldn’t be elected, and noted that they did not do anything to hurt Trump’s odds, like leaking the existence of the Russia probe before the election. Goelman told the Washington Post on Sunday that there’s “no question” that Strzok regrets sending the messages, but that “I think what he was doing is expressing his political opinions in what he thought was a private text conversation, and he regrets that this has been weaponized by people with political motivations to try to discredit the Mueller investigation.”Mueller removed Strzok from his investigation several weeks after it started following the discovery of the texts.Goelman said that if asked to testify, Strzok would be willing to testify without immunity, and would not invoke his Fifth Amendment rights. He said the agent “intends to answer any question put to him, and he intends to defend the integrity of the Clinton email investigation, the Russia collusion investigation to the extent that that’s a topic, and his own integrity.”Trump reiterated his thoughts on the matter on Sunday night, which are not supported by the inspector general’s findings. The report did not cover the Russia probe, though that did not stop Trump’s allies from calling for Mueller’s immediate suspension.Why was the FBI’s sick loser, Peter Strzok, working on the totally discredited Mueller team of 13 Angry & Conflicted Democrats, when Strzok was giving Crooked Hillary a free pass yet telling his lover, lawyer Lisa Page, that “we’ll stop” Trump from becoming President?

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2018Strzok still works for the FBI, but it’s unclear what he does now. The inspector general referred him, Page, and three other people to the FBI office that handles disciplinary action.",But he is not facing any criminal charges.The FBI said it would not comment on Strzok’s future employment status.

politifact15492,1,1,"January 2nd, 2005, was a very important day in seven-year-old Katie Flynn’s life.She was one of the flower girls at her aunt Lisa’s wedding, along with her younger sister Grace.Over 200 friends and relatives had gathered on a beach in Long Island to witness Lisa and David exchange their vows and join in holy matrimony.The guests watched on as Katie and Grace walked down the isle with their beautiful dresses and innocent smiles – but nobody could have known this was to be the last day of young Katie’s life.After a long day of love, laughter and festivities, the bride’s parents, Christopher and Denice, along with her sister, Jennifer, Jennifer’s husband, Neil, and their two young daughters, Katie and Grace, got in the limousine that would take them home.“I remember looking in on the limo and seeing Kate and waving goodbye and she waved goodbye and never thought that was going to be the type of moment where you’re seeing people for the last time,” the groom, David, told CNN.The limousine left the Long Island wedding and joined the highway. They could never have known that a drunk 24-year-old, Marin Heidgen, was also on the road. Heidgen, driving on the wrong side of the road, hit the limo head-on, causing a devastating accident.Police reports revealed that Heidgen’s blood alcohol level was more than three times the legal limit. He had consumed at least 14 drinks and had been driving at 70 miles an hour, on the wrong side of the highway, for at least two miles before the catastrophic accident occurred.The driver of the limousine, 59-year-old Stanley Rabinowitz, was killed instantly after being crushed by the engine. The bride’s father, Christopher, broke both of his legs in several places after being thrown to the floor. He later had to have one amputated. His wife, Denise, was also seriously injured, and little Grace was stuck in the folds of the wreckage.Despite having a broken back, Neil attempted to crawl from the car to seek help. Meanwhile, Jennifer, who had injured her foot, was desperately searching for Katie, who had been lying on the side seat at the time of the crash.Then, Jennifer Flynn came across something that no mother should ever have to witness – her daughter, Katie, had been decapitated by her own seat-belt.One of the first responders on the scene was Michael Tangney, the bride’s uncle and a policeman himself. He had been at the wedding just hours before:“I was walking to the rear of the limousine when a gentleman was coming away from it, and he said, ‘Don’t go back there. It’s bad,’” Michael Tangney said. “I opened the rear door to the limousine and realized it was my family.”But, tragically, the worst was yet to come.Michael Tagney would witness Jennifer emerging from the wreck with her daughter’s head in her hands. Katie’s body remained in the car, still in the dress she had proudly worn for the wedding only a few hours previous.For the next hour, Jennifer sat next to the road. She kept Katie’s head on her lap and watched as the rest of her family was freed from the wreckage of the destroyed vehicle.Eventually, she let her daughter go; handing her to Michael. Before she did so, she kissed her daughter’s face one last time.The event altered the lives of the whole family. Martin Heidgen was sentenced to 18 years in prison for two counts of second-degree murder – though nothing, of course, can ever bring back Jennifer’s daughter.Jennifer and Neil have bravely chosen to talk openly about their story, in the hope that it might prevent a similar catastrophe from happening again.“Since no one should have to live the life I do, I felt a responsibility, an obligation, to stand up and tell our story,” Jennifer said.“I hope that by experiencing the devastation that we survived that night, and still continue to live through, people can see the seriousness of drunk driving as the crime it really is. Hopefully we will save more in the future.”The fact that people still drive drunk will come as no surprise to you.I’m sure y","’all can relate to this, but when you’re in a car crash, you’re not in a car crash.You’re in a car crash when you’re in a car crash.You’re in a car crash.

politifact14814,1,0,"According to CNN, the former police chief of a small New Jersey town said African-Americans had “no value” and were “like ISIS,” and said he wanted to put them before a firing squad, and now the racist has been arrested.The FBI has arrested Frank Nucera Jr., who was the chief of Bordentown Township Police Department. They allege Nuncera referred to African-Americans using several racial slurs and told his officers to position police dogs at high school basketball games to specifically intimidate African-Americans.Nucera abruptly retired in February after he learned his use of racially motivated force was under investigation. He was making $151,418.31 per year. Nucera draws an annual pension of $105,992.76 — $8,832.73 per month — according to public records.Sixty-year-old Nucera is facing a hate crime charge and a federal civil rights charge. FBI Special Agent Vernon Addison wrote in an affidavit that Nucera “has a significant history of making racist comments concerning African Americans, to whom he frequently referred to as ‘n*ggers'”. One of Nucera’s officers “made numerous recordings” of Nucera that “contained extremely offensive racist comments” over the course of a year because he was “alarmed” by Nucera’s racism, according to the affidavit.The federal charges against Nucera relate to a Sept. 1, 2016, police encounter involving an 18-year-old African-American man and 16-year-old African-American girl. A hotel manager called police because he said the pair hadn’t paid for their hotel room the night before and were swimming in the hotel pool. The FBI affidavit states that their encounter with police “escalated into a physical struggle,” that both teens “resisted arrest” and that one of the officers used pepper spray.AdvertisementAfter both teens were handcuffed, Nucera grabbed the 18-year-old’s head and slammed it “into the right side of the metal doorjamb,” according to the affidavit. An officer heard the 18-year-old’s head make “a loud thud” as it hit the doorjamb, the feds alleged. Officers said the 18-year-old wasn’t resisting when Nucera slammed his head, but had “stopped walking for a moment to loudly complain.” The use of force wasn’t reported to the department.Hours after the assault, Nucera was recorded telling an officer he was “f*cking tired” of African-Americans.“I’ll tell you what, it’s gonna get to the point where I could shoot one of these motherfuckers,” Nucera allegedly said. “And that n*ggerr bitch lady, she almost got it,” he said, referring to the 16-year-old girl’s aunt, who was present at the arrest. “Fucking nipple hanging bitch. I’m so tired of them, man.”Nucera allegedly said that black people should “stay the fuck out of Bordentown” and referred to the 18-year-old as “fucking little, fucking n****r.”In a separate incident noted in the report that occurred in November 2015, Nucera said he wished an African-American from Trenton who he believed had slashed the tires of a police vehicle would give him a reason to “put my hands” on him.“These n****rs are like ISIS, they have no value,” Nucera allegedly said. “They should line them all up and mow ’em down. I’d like to be on the firing squad, I could do it. I used to think about if I could shoot someone or not, I could do it, I’m tired of it.”“The conduct alleged is shocking,” acting US Attorney William E. Fitzpatrick said at a news conference.“It’s a shocking breach of the duty of every police officer to provide equal justice under the law and to never mistreat a person in their custody.”AdvertisementNucera appeared in court Wednesday afternoon in Camden, NJ, and waived his right to a preliminary hearing. He was released on a bail of $500,000.","If convicted, he could face up to life in prison.According to the FBI, Nucera referred to African-Americans using racial slurs and told his officers to position police dogs at high school basketball games to intimidate African-Americans. He allegedly assaulted a teenager during a confrontation and made offensive comments about him.Nucera has been placed on administrative leave and has retired from the police department. He is facing charges of hate crime and civil rights violations.His arrest comes at a time when tensions are high between law enforcement and communities of color, particularly in the wake of a number of high-profile incidents of police misconduct. Nucera’s comments and actions are a stark reminder of the harm that can be caused by racism and bigotry.

politifact15356,1,0,"2.4k SHARES Share TweetPhotos of arrested illegal immigrants from cage-like cells moved viral this weekend. Liberals were too quick to disperse this shocking picture, as proof of President Donald Trump’s cruelty. But their incredible blunder just backfired. Now, they’re screwed.The answer, naturally, is a resounding no. Democrats will do anything to undermine the president’s work. That includes being underhanded, manipulative, and cruel as possible.Within the course of Trump’s period in office, we have seen liberals do some shockingly dreadful things. They’ve insulted his wife by criticizing her intelligence, state of origin, as well as her accent, demonstrating who the real racists and sexists are.Liberals didn’t hesitate to question his children’s psychological health, even calling Barron handicapped. That is not even mentioning the numerous times that left handed outlets edited videos or photos to create Trump look like a poor guy.However, what they did that this weekend actually takes the cake. A photo went viral throughout Twitter. The dreadful picture depicted arrested illegal immigrants. These individuals — arrested by our government — were made to stay in cages resembling dog kennels.It is too bad that these liberals did not bother to check the date on the film.Ex-Obama staffer Jon Favreau, in a now-deleted conversation, linked to a AZCentral.com article titled,”First glance of immigrant kids at holding facility” and said”This is occurring right now, and the only argument that issue is the way we force our government to get these kids back to their families as quickly as possible”His obvious intent was to slam the Trump government for its treatment of unaccompanied minors taken into custody at the border. [Source: Twitchy]Jon Favreau was among many liberals who assaulted Trump within this injustice. The famous Hollywood actor and director once worked for Obama as his speechwriter. So I guess he understood how better things were under the last government, right? This liberal celebrity is likely horrified every day over what he sees coming from the White House. I mean, that could let something as bad as this:How dreadful! Certainly the guy responsible for this is a total racist, who hates brown people. Liberals have every right to spread this photograph to as many people as possible.But wait, let’s look at the initial post. It was from ACCentral.com. As stated by the date, this was composed in 2014.That’s right, liberals. This photograph you are so outraged more than was taken through Obama’s administration.Liberals were not storming Twitter with demands for change. They were not calling Obama racist for treating kids like this. Why weren’t the overlords inside the mainstream press requiring answers from his government?Appears like liberals didn’t care when Obama mistreated illegals. Yet they accuse Trump of racism, dependent on nothing. All Trump wants to do is protect our border from crime and terrorism.He is not treating illegals like creatures. However, while Trump calls vile MS-13 members”animals,” Obama was treating children like creatures. Really makes you think.Liberals, in their own feverish hatred for Trump, unwittingly outed among Obama’s numerous sins. And their own. They pretend to care, as a response to Trump’s stance on immigration.Before Trump suggested the wall, liberals did not think twice about illegals. We all know that for a fact since this article has been around for FOUR decades, and they have said nothing.Featured Image Source H/T: MadWorldNewsLike this: Like Loading...",Paragraphs break automatically after a certain number of words.

politifact15210,1,0,"320 SHARES Share TweetPresident Trump is about to end the longstanding abuse of the American welfare system and ban migrants from getting free money and handouts for five years. The immigration rules will prohibit migrants from coming to the country and taking advantage of free American welfare money right away. It will slow down, or stop, chain migration while protecting American workers and potentially saving taxpayers money.What used to happen is that people would migrate to America and just live on the free money they received. That’s called welfare abuse. America is open to migrants, but perhaps we don’t want migrants who can’t fend for themselves. Maybe it’s better if people who are self-sufficient migrate to the country so that we can reduce the amount of citizens living off the system.President Trump wants to introduce a merit-based Green card system in which migrants compete for Visas. Migrants can earn points for themselves by learning to speak English, gaining job training or job offers, or doing something else that is considered a benefit to the America. The idea seems to be that in order for America to grant Visas or citizenship, the migrant has to give something back to the country. It’s as though the government wants to stop people coming to America and living off the system and would prefer people coming to the country to be contributors. Do something for America and America will do something for you.Migrants to those countries must compete for a limited number of visas by gaining points for English proficiency, competitive training, a job offer or another major achievement that benefits the host country.The concept, which is modeled after similar programs from Australia and Canada, is taking harsh criticism from activists. It’s like they want an open border policy where everyone gets free welfare money, but that would just be the downfall of America. If we observe what’s happening in Germany, with Merkel’s “come on in” policy, then we see a mass increase in horrible crimes like gang rape. Do we want mass amounts of migrant gang rape in America? There’s already enough trouble with crime in sanctuary cities that protect illegal immigrant criminals. Those folks should be deported because of their bad behavior and often violent crimes they commit on American people and even other immigrants.If America prevents immigrants from getting free benefits for five years, then that makes people think twice about coming here. If a family who thinks about crossing the border to start a new life knows that they cannot live for free, then they may not come at all. If they have possible jobs lined up and will be almost instantly integrating successfully with society, then that’s a great match. America is the land of the free, but not the land of the free money.Migrants who enter the United States cannot receive welfare during their first five years in the country, President Trump revealed from his upcoming immigration overhaul.“Just this week, we announced a historic immigration bill to create a merit-based Green Card system that ends the abuse of our welfare system, stops chain migration, and protects our workers and our economy,” he stated on his weekly radio address. “As an example, you cannot get welfare for five years when you come into our country.”“You cannot just come in like in past weeks, years, and decades, you come in immediately and start picking up welfare. For five years, you have to say you will not be asking or using our welfare systems.”Compare that to Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel opened the border to millions of unvetted migrants who can’t speak German and lack employable skills, which dooms them to perpetual welfare paid by German taxpayers – and boredom that manifests into terrorist attacks against, once again, German taxpayers.Last year the German government admitted that only 2.8% of over 1.2 million migrants had gotten a job – but even then those statistics might be exaggerated, according to j","aded observers.The United States is trying to learn from the mistakes of other countries, and create an immigration system that benefits Americans and not just foreign nationals.If America can create an immigration system that’s fair, efficient, and effective, it will help to ensure that our economy is growing, that our society is strong, and that our people are safe."

Student organizers from Never Again MSD planned the march in collaboration with the nonprofit organization Everytown for Gun Safety. The event followed the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, which was described by many media outlets as a possible tipping point for gun control legislation.Never Again MSD (MSD refers to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School) is a group started on social media as a movement “For survivors of the Stoneman Douglas Shooting, by survivors of the Stoneman Douglas Shooting” using the hashtag #NeverAgain.The MSD student survivors who formed Never Again MSD include the now-famous David Hogg, Emma Gonzalez, and Cameron Kasky.Public demonstrations, especially those that are large-scale like March For Our Lives, require a permit from the police department of the city in which the demonstration will take place.A source of European researcher Ole Dammegard contacted the Metropolitan D.C. Police Department concerning the permit for the March For Our Lives demonstration in Washington, D.C.Dammegard’s source received the following email from Officer Scott C. Earhardt of the Homeland Security Bureau of the Metropolitan Police Department and forwarded it to Dammegard:Good morning, In reference to your inquiry concerning the March For Our Lives Demonstration, here in the District of Columbia on March 24, 2018.

A day after the shooting, on February 15, 2018, MSD students formed the group, Never Again MSD. On March 24, 2018, March For Our Lives demonstrations took place in Washington, D.C. (and other cities). Among the organizers of March For Our Lives is Never Again MSD , which had not existed before February 15 . The D.C.

How can an application be made for a permit for a “March For Our Lives” demonstration “several months” BEFORE the Parkland MSD school shooting that galvanized MSD students to form the Never Again MSD group that organized the demonstration?See also:UPDATE (March 31, 2018):There are claims that the email from Officer Earhardt is bogus, and that there’s a permit application for March For Our Lives in D.C. which is dated February 20, 2018, but which is an application to th","wart the demonstration, not to authorize it.This suggests that there may have been an attempt to thwart the demonstration by creating a permit application that had the wrong date on it. I have not yet been able to confirm the authenticity of this claim, but it is worth noting.Another update (April 2, 2018):Officer Scott C.

And it’s time for that to end.”Senate Democrats have vowed to make sure that any new nominee isn’t going to be beholden to outside influences like the Constitution, the founding fathers, or the rule of law. “We need judges to be advocates of progressive laws,” Senator Elizabeth Warren added. “Not people who will bow to the whims of the Constitution, pitting its extremist values of freedom of speech and freedom of religion against our agenda.”“We’re sick and tired of the Constitution sitting in the National Archives, manipulating everything we do,” stated Senator Cory Booker, trying to emote for the cameras but failing. Booker then called a ten-minute recess for him to refresh his supply of fake tears before he could continue.Asked about their concerns, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he “doesn’t care” and plans to “completely ignore” the Democrats in the nomination process since “there’s nothing they can do” and he is “literally unstoppable.”","However, McConnell admitted that he would “work with the President to come up with a nominee that the President would love” so that the nomination process could be “over and done with as quickly as possible” so that he can get back to “doing important things.”

politifact14270,1,0,"Leonardo DiCaprio has sailed on the Titanic, battled grizzly bears in the brutal Wild West, and explored dreams. Now, though, the 41-year-old actor says he’s going to travel to Mars — but for real.Well, at least that’s what he told President Barack Obama.DiCaprio was at the White House on Monday night as part of the South by South Lawn event. The actor, the president, and climate scientist Dr. Katharine Hayhoe took the stage towards the end of the evening for a conversation on climate change before the U.S. premiere of DiCaprio’s new documentary on the subject, Before the Flood.The subject of Mars and SpaceX came up while Hayhoe was talking about the need to make people connect with the reality of climate change on a universal, human level. “The most important thing to do is not to pile up scientific reports until they reach a tottering pile of about 8 feet where they tip over and crush somebody,” Hayhoe said, explaining that what really matters when trying to motivate people to combat climate change thing is to connect its real meaning and impact to “what’s in our hearts.”“The reality of it is, if you’re a human living on this planet — which most of us are, yeah?” she joked. “As long as we haven’t signed up for the trip to Mars. I don’t want to know if anyone has, I think you’re crazy.”Article continues below Get a weekly round-up of the most essential Elon Musk news sent to your inbox. Sign up for our newsletter: sign upAs Hayhoe expressed her belief that anyone who was on board with Elon Musk’s recently detailed plans for a possibly deadly trip to Mars was nuts, DiCaprio chimed in to say, “I did.”Hayhoe attempted to assure the famous actor that she didn’t actually think he was nuts, but Obama jumped in.“I think he’ll acknowledge he’s crazy,” the president said with a smile.It’s unclear if the millionaire actor really plans on traveling to Mars and quite possibly dying in the process. Remember, though, Leo finally won an Oscar for his role in The Revenant, in part due to the brutal conditions he endured while filming it. Maybe, just maybe, he figured the only place tougher than frozen uncharted western territories is the Martian surface. The Academy would love it.It’s probably method acting, is what we’re saying.Earlier in the night, Obama made a Star Trek reference while talking about the importance of flawed but useful energy sources like fracking and nuclear power. “Until we invent the perfect energy source — Lithium crystals or whatever, Scotty’s there beaming us up — but until then we need to live in the real world,” Obama said.","DiCaprio, who has been a vocal advocate for environmental issues, chimed in to say that the planet needed to be protected and that he was glad to see so many people in the audience. “The future of our planet is at stake,” he said. “We are the first generation to feel the impact of climate change and we are the last generation that can do something about it.”The full transcript of the conversation is available on the White House’s website."

politifact15505,1,0,"Hillary Clinton’s State Department gifted an “unknown number” of children to human traffickers after refusing to run the most basic checks on these so-called “caregivers,” according to a bombshell Senate report released late on Thursday and completely covered up by mainstream media.These children were then sexually abused, starved, and forced into child labor, according to the Senate report. Disturbingly, the fate of many of these children, mostly migrants, remains unknown.NY Mag reports: Local law enforcement uncovered the operation last year, prompting the Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations to open an inquiry into the federal government’s handling of migrants.“It is intolerable that human trafficking — modern-day slavery — could occur in our own backyard,” Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio and the chairman of the subcommittee, told the New York Times. “But what makes the Marion cases even more alarming is that a U.S. government agency was responsible for delivering some of the victims into the hands of their abusers.”As detention centers became incapable of housing the massive influx of migrants, the Department of Health and Human Services started placing children into the care of sponsors who would oversee the minors until their bids for refugee status could be reviewed. But in many cases, officials failed to confirm whether the adults volunteering for this task were actually relatives or good Samaritans — and not unscrupulous egg farmers or child molesters.The department performed check-in visits at caretakers’ homes in only 5 percent of cases between 2013 and 2015, according to the report.The Senate’s investigation built on an Associated Press report that found more than two dozen unaccompanied children were placed in homes where they were sexually abused, starved, or forced into slave labor. HHS claimed that it lacked the funds and authorities that a more rigorous screening process would have required.However, the investigation also found that HHS did not spend all of the money allocated to it for handling the crisis.The agency placed 90,000 migrant children into sponsor care between 2013 and 2015. Exactly how many of those fell prey to traffickers is unknown, because the agency does not keep track.","The Trump administration has made no moves to address these concerns, despite the fact that the report was produced under the Obama administration. Instead, the Trump administration has focused on restricting legal immigration.

Paraphrased passage: The U.S. State Department, under Hillary Clinton, knowingly placed children with human traffickers by failing to conduct basic checks on their caregivers. These children were then subjected to sexual abuse, starvation, and forced labor. The Senate report found that local law enforcement uncovered the trafficking operation last year and that the government agency responsible for placing children with sponsors failed to properly vet the adults they were placing these children with. The report also found that the agency responsible for handling the migrant children did not keep track of how many of them fell victim to traffickers, as it did not have the necessary resources. The Trump administration has not taken any action to address these issues, despite the report being produced under the Obama administration."

politifact14621,1,0,"The federal government grants some businesses the ability to pay reduced or no taxes because they are set up as a “non-profit.” The NFL is one of those businesses – or was, until Sunday evening when Donald Trump quietly signed an executive order removing the sports league’s non-profit status.The order notes the un-American attitude displayed by the players, who repeatedly kneel during the National Anthem, burn flags in their locker rooms, and disrespect our country in every way imaginable.To date, little has been done to stop players from disrespecting our military, our flag, and all they stand for, so President Trump “temporarily” revoked their 401(c)(3) status “until it is clear that players and team owners respect their country.”The NFL will be classified as a for-profit entity for tax purposes for the 2017 fiscal year, but the order allows the league to re-apply for tax-exempt status in January 2018 “if all of the problems are solved.”The White House spokeswoman told Breitbart News that the President hopes to see all the “athletes protesting our police and our flag or otherwise using their positions to spread hate” fired and replaced with people who “love and respect America.”[adrotate banner=""3""]The NFL has thus far refused comment.","With the NFL no longer considered a non-profit, the organization will be subject to federal taxes, which could cost the league millions of dollars. According to the Wall Street Journal, the NFL has a net income of $14 billion and paid out $1.8 billion in taxes from 2006 to 2015.

politifact14700,1,0,"Congresswoman Maxine Waters has reignited her political career as one of the most outspoken leaders of the Trump “Resistance.” She regularly and often beats the drum of impeachment for the president. However, in August of 2010, it was Waters who was under legal scrutiny for her behavior as a government official. Waters was charged with three counts of violating House rules and the federal ethics code.According to The Hill’s report from 2010:The House ethics committee on Monday outlined its charges against Rep. Maxine Waters, who is accused of helping a bank in which her husband owned stock secure federal bailout funds. The committee charged the 10-term California Democrat with three counts of violating House rules and the federal ethics code in connection with her effort to arrange a 2008 meeting between Treasury officials and representatives with OneUnited bank. The panel said Waters, who sits on the Financial Services Committee, broke a House rule requiring members to behave in a way that reflects “creditably” on the chamber. The committee said that by trying to assist OneUnited, she stood to benefit directly, because her husband owned a sizable amount of stock that would have been “worthless” if the bank failed. The committee also accused Waters of violating the “spirit” of a House rule prohibiting lawmakers from using their positions for financial gain, as well as a government ethics statute banning the dispensing of “special favors.”The charges were delayed and stalled by members of the committee, and multiple attorneys in the case were fired. Ultimately, Waters was absolved of the charges.According to National Review:[Waters] walked away with a slap on the wrist from the toothless House Ethics Committee in 2012 after being charged with multiple ethics violations related to her meddling in minority-owned OneUnited Bank … As stockholders, they profited handsomely from their relationship with the bank. It was a mutually beneficial relationship. After Waters’s office personally intervened and lobbied the Treasury Department in 2008, OneUnited received $12 million in federal TARP bailout money — despite another government agency concluding that the bank operated “without effective underwriting standards” and engaged “in speculative investment practices. After the federal bailout of Fannie/Freddie, OneUnited’s stock in the government-sponsored enterprises plunged to a value estimated at less than $5 million. Only through Waters’s intervention was OneUnited able to secure an emergency meeting with the Treasury and then-Secretary Henry Paulson. Tom Fitton, Judicial Watch president, reported that Waters’s friend and fellow California Democratic congresswoman Zoe Lofgren helped delay Waters’s scheduled 2010 House ethics trial on the matter by stalling subpoenas and improperly firing two attorneys working on the investigation. Six of ten House Ethics panel members quit the case in 2012 over questions about their partiality. An outside investigator absolved Waters of any wrongdoing. In spite of getting off on the charges, Waters carries with her a terrible reputation for corruption. Please see this list for a rundown of all the numerous scandals and charges which have been brought against her. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington has listed her as one of the most corrupt members of Congress five times. Resist.","org, which supports the anti-Trump “Resistance” movement, recently featured her as one of its most prominent leaders. And yet, despite all of this, she continues to serve in Congress."
politifact14840,1,1,"The FDA has published conclusive proof on their website that the DTap vaccine can cause autism.According to the FDA’s online Biologics Blood Vaccines document, a vaccine manufacturer admits on its package insert that their vaccination can cause autism as one of many adverse reactions.These adverse events reported during post-approval use of Tripedia vaccine include idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, SIDS, anaphylactic reaction, cellulitis, autism, convulsion/grand mal convulsion, encephalopathy, hypotonia, neuropathy, somnolence and apnea. Events were included in this list because of the seriousness or frequency of reporting. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequencies or to establish a causal relationship to components of Tripedia vaccine.In this sense, it should be noted that:Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Concentrates (For Further Manufacturing Use) are produced by The Research Foundation for Microbial Diseases of Osaka University (BIKEN), Osaka, Japan, under United States (US) license, and are combined with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur Inc. Tripedia vaccine is filled, labeled, packaged, and released by Sanofi Pasteur Inc.What’s in Tripedia that probably can interfere with brain chemistry and neurology?According to the Tripedia’s package insert, some ingredients include: Bovine extract, formaldehyde used to inactivate microorganisms a couple of times, ammonium sulfate, aluminum potassium sulfate and two growth mediums: modified Mueller and Miller is one; the other is Stainer-Scholte medium.What is the content of these two growth mediums?Mueller and Miller medium, contains:Glucose, sodium chloride, sodium phosphate dibasic, monopotassium, phosphate, magnesium sulfate hydrate, ferrous sulfate heptahydrate, cysteine hydrochloride, tyrosine hydrochloride, uracil hydrochloride, Ca-pantothenate in ethanol, thiamine in ethanol, pyridoxine-hydrochloride in ethanol, riboflavin in ethanol, biotin in ethanol, sodium hydroxide, beef heart infusion (de- fatted beef heart and distilled water), casein [milk protein] solution. Basically a mixture of sugar, salt, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals.While Stainer-Scholte medium has the following ingredients:Tris hydrochloride, tris base, glutamate (monosodium salt) [MSG], proline, salt, monopotassium phosphate, potassium chloride, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, ferrous sulfate, ascorbic acid, niacin, glutathione.The vaccine is formulated without preservatives, but contains a trace amount of thimerosal [(mercury derivative), (≤0.3 μg mercury/dose)] from the manufacturing process. Each 0.5 mL dose also contains, by assay, not more than 0.170 mg of aluminum and not more than 100 μg(0.02%) of residual formaldehyde. The vaccine contains gelatin and polysorbate 80 (Tween-80), which are used in the production of the pertussis concentrate.“Probable cause” ingredients for adverse reactions include: casein, to which some children are allergic; MSG—an excitotoxin; thimerosal-ethyl mercury; aluminum; formaldehyde; gelatin; and polysorbate 80.You might be wondering:Why some of the doctors don’t say anything about the risk of DTaP Vaccine?That is a question that many of us, still wondering! Maybe they just is just not convenient for them that we know about the risk of these vaccine.To take the vaccine debacle further, most of the mandated vaccines for infants and children, contain many of the above ingredients, which must be stopped from being injected into infants, toddlers, teens and even adults!It’s time for Congress to rescind the “Get out of Jail Free” card for vaccine makers and stop the aggressive onslaught of the Autism Spectrum Disorder that is depriving children of a fulfilling life and ruining families emotionally, financially, and physically to the point of parents divorcing because of the stresses of ASD in a family.It’s about time vaccines are publicl","ly debated by the scientists, doctors, and politicians to discuss the evidence and the facts. Because the FDA is not doing its job and the CDC is not doing its job and the vaccine court is not doing its job, it’s time for Congress to step in and take control of this issue and let the public know the truth.Because it’s not about politics, it’s about the health of our children and the future of our nation.If a doctor is not telling you about the risk of the DTaP Vaccine, you should ask them! It’s your right to know the risks before you make a decision about whether or not to vaccinate your child.Remember, you are your child’s best advocate. It’s time to take charge of your child’s health and make informed decisions. Vaccines are not the only way to protect your child from diseases. There are other ways to protect your child’s health, such as proper nutrition, exercise, and a healthy lifestyle.Don’t let the government and pharmaceutical companies dictate your child’s health decisions. Do your own research and make the best decision for your child’s health.It’s your right to know the truth!

Paraphrase: The FDA has published evidence on their website that the DTap vaccine can cause autism. The vaccine contains a number of potentially harmful ingredients, including bovine extract, formaldehyde, ammonium sulfate, aluminum potassium sulfate, growth mediums, MSG, thimerosal, and residual formaldehyde. Some children may be allergic to casein, an ingredient in the vaccine, and MSG is an excitotoxin. Other ingredients, such as thimerosal and aluminum, have been linked to adverse reactions. Despite the potential risks, many doctors do not discuss the risks of the vaccine with their patients. It is important for parents to do their own research and make informed decisions about whether or not to vaccinate their children.

Michigan DNR Marine Biologist Dr. Debra Polowotski arrived at Good Harbor Bay and confirmed the 21 foot-long giant squid to be a very rare fresh-water species of genus Architeuthis. “We thought they were already in Lake Erie, we had no idea they were in Lake Michigan. This is first time there’s been an actual specimen recovered, so this is very exciting”, she said. It is believed that a few of the squid escaped from the Cleveland Sea World complex during the great Northeast blackout of 2003 when they were very young, and somehow made it into Lake Erie. According to Dr. Polowotski, the squid were kept contained in Lake Erie, as the Detroit River is too narrow and shallow for the squid to swim upstream. “They are intimidated by closed-in spaces. They need a lot of room. You have to remember that this is a very big animal”, she said. Dr. Polotwotski also confirmed that the squid is a female and further examination of the corpse indicated that it had recently laid eggs. “Hopefully the walleye can keep the tiny-giant squid population under control, else there is some cause for concern”, said Dr. Polowotski. “Boaters and swimmers really need to exercise some caution”. The animal was discovered by Bob Ritchie and his sister Jill, both of Romeo. “We were just, you know, taking an evening walk along the beach, heading out to the sandbar when we stumbled across it”, said Bob. “We were singing, drinking whiskey out of the bottle, not thinking about tomorrow. But something like this really does make you stop and think”, he said. DNR officials removed the animal from the beach and took it to an undisclosed location for further study.","“The giant squid is a highly prized specimen and we are going to take it back to the lab and do a full necropsy”, said Dr. Polowotski.

politifact15298,1,1,"Denzel’s recent comments about the “Orwellian Police State” is so very apparent, given the FBI, DNC, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama scandal inside the administration’s treasonous activity in having the Clinton Foundation pay for a fake dossier, made by Christopher Steele and Fusion GPS, which they hoped would create false allegations which would concede Donald Trump’s Presidential victory. This fake dossier was then passed to James Comey at the FBI, who then issued FISA warrants to surveillance Donald Trump at the Trump Tower prior to the election, which later sparked Robert Mueller’s Special Counsel to investigate any Russian collusion in the 2016 Presidential Election. This, in a nutshell, exposes the spying and the treason that the DNC committed under the Obama administration to try to prevent Trump from succeeding, which is all stated in the Nunes Memo.Denzel affirmed, “If the Democrats had won the election, we never would have found out they were using false documents to get warrants to spy on American citizens and political opponents. We never would have known this. Think about it!”Denzel Washington, who has been nominated for Best Actor for the film ‘Roman J. Israel, Esq.’ (his 8th total Oscar nomination), didn’t pull any punches on the revelations of the released memo, stating: “They would have a tool they would use over and over again to circumvent the will of the people in future elections”.When a reporter then asked Denzel Washington if he felt the memo released by Congress on Friday was “reliable”, he responded, “Hell yeah, it’s reliable. We don’t need to know the nitty gritty to understand exactly what’s happened here”.“We know that a warrant to spy on the Trump team was issued based on media reports, and these media reports were based on information provided by an opposition research firm being paid by the DNC and Hillary Clinton.”“You guys can’t see what is wrong with this? You’re kidding me. Well I guess you are reporters. How many reporters was it that got caught colluding with the Clinton campaign?”Denzel Washington then later called out individual reporters and media outlets for never publishing anything negative about the Democrat Party, and subsequently hiding their scandals from any in-depth news output.Denzel continued, “I grew up a Democrat. I get it. I know a lot of people who hate Trump with a real passion. But you’ve got to understand that we dodged a bullet when Clinton lost. More than one bullet. We avoided the creation of an Orwellian Police State”.We couldn’t agree more, and we thank god for Donald Trump every day, which has been our sentiment all along here at Brainstain. We also wonder why the mainstream news media is now trying to downplay the severity of the memo, as if it didn’t constitute complete treason?The double standards are “oh so” apparent, and it’s good to see somebody high up in celebrity circles like Denzel Washington to be brave enough speak out on these pressing issues, and helping to expose the scandals of the Democrat Party.","Denzel Washington, a winner of two Oscars, has been in the movie business for over four decades, and it’s not often that a Hollywood legend like him speaks out on political issues like this. The man has been nominated for 8 Oscars, and he knows how to deliver a powerful message when he wants to. And what he said in this interview was a powerful message indeed."

politifact14777,1,0,"The state of Michigan is quickly turning into a Sharia swamp, thanks to the reckless immigration policies of Obama over the past 8 years. Not only are portions of Michigan being transformed into a “mini Baghdad,” but the state is also being overrun with rampant illegal activity, where the Muslim populace is constantly being busted in welfare fraud and disgusting mutilation practices on little girls. Now thanks to the hordes of Muslims taking over the state, Michigan can add another “accomplishment” on their list, as the Justice Department is dubbing what just went down in this state the “largest scam in United States history.”Muslims continually prove that they have little intentions into assimilating into western civilization or adhering to our nation’s laws after arriving to America from their third world countries. Our generosity to these savages is frequently repaid by insolence, as many Muslims are constantly busted at the center of welfare fraud rings, as they seek to scam the very country who has given them so much. In yet another case of blatant disregard for for our nation’s laws, a group of Muslim doctors in Detroit have just been busted as the masterminds behind a $1.3 billion dollar fraudulent scheme, leading to the arrests of 412 people overnight, in the “largest scam” that the United States Department of Justice has ever seen.The scam involves a scheme where Muslim doctors will write massive quantities of prescriptions for opioids. These drugs never land in the hands of patients however, as the Muslims will them make fraudulent claims to Medicaid and pocket the money. Additionally, the drugs often wind of on the streets as part of a huge back-alley drug operation. The U.S. Justice Department is calling this prescription drug and health care fraud scheme the largest operation of its kind in American history, naming several Michigan Muslim doctors responsible for orchestrating this huge criminal enterprise to rip off Medicare. ClickonDetroit.com has more:“Officials have made 412 arrests nationwide, including 56 doctors and targeting 200 clinics. The Justice Department said those arrested are responsible for $1.3 billion in fraudulent transactions.Federal officials said a group of Michigan doctors was responsible for a major chunk of the scheme.One of the clinics hit in the sting operations is in Farmington. Federal officials said the opioid epidemic is part of it, but the medical office and a number of others were set up specifically as a criminal enterprise to rip off Medicare.Federal officers raided the Fisher Building Wednesday, and U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said their work accounted for 10 percent of the scam’s value.‘Six doctors in Michigan prescribed patients with unnecessary opioids, some of which ended up for sale on the streets,’ Sessions said.A physician group called Global Quality used to operate out of a Woodward Avenue office building.”The ring leader of the massive Medicare scam is Muslim Mashiyat Rashid, who profited with an astounding $164 million from the fraud. He had had no qualms about rubbing the American taxpayers’ noses in what he stole from them, frequently bragging about his large piles of cash on social media. Here’s an image he posted on Facebook where he poses beside his Bentely sedan and corporate jet…all bought and paid for with the Medicare money he scammed from the American taxpayer.Other nauseating pictures show Rashid standing at the NBA finals with his court-side tickets, enjoying a life of opulence he enjoyed while screwing over the American people. Rashid’s name is included in court documents as Feds prepare their case for trial, where Muslim doctors Joseph Betro, Spilios Pappas, Abdul Haq, Tariz Omar and Mohammad Zahoor were busted working directly with Rashid in recent years to make their millions.More than 400 others across the country were charged late last week for taking part in the health care scam in connection with a raid last week at the Fisher Building in De","Troits. Officials have described the scheme as “massive” and “brazen.” And as one would expect, this is not the first time the Obama administration has been involved in allowing such scams to go unpunished. Obama had a history of coddling and enabling Muslim criminals, and now the Justice Department is saying that this is the largest scam in United States history.The scam involved prescription drug fraud and health care fraud, and according to the Department of Justice, it involved a group of doctors who were prescribing patients with unnecessary opioids and then submitting fraudulent claims to Medicare. The doctors were allegedly pocketing the money and selling the drugs on the black market.The scam is the largest of its kind in U.S. history, and it is estimated to have cost taxpayers more than $1.3 billion. The Justice Department has charged 56 doctors and has arrested 412 people in connection with the scheme. One of the doctors, Mashiyat Rashid, is accused of making more than $164 million from the scheme.

politifact13816,1,0,"Living in regular-sized homes with plenty of space for closets, lockers and shelves gives us little need to think about storage space. In tiny homes, space comes at a premium so storage space is one of the key issues that a tiny house owner will have to plan for when building, buying or furnishing their home. There is only so much we can downsize by moving to a tiny home, so planning for storage space is an integral part of preparation for tiny living.VerticalityTiny houses for sale in Florida have tiny floor plans. There is only so much space to put things on the floor, and once bare necessities such as beds, kitchen elements etc. are taken care of, there is little space left to put all of our stuff. Verticality is key in these situations. Wall-mounted shelving is excellent for organizing your stuff and it doesn’t demand a single inch of your floor. They are also quite inexpensive and easy to install. Instead of having an entertainment center, it is now easy to mount your TV and speakers on the wall, leaving more space for things you can’t compromise with.Multi-functional FurnitureIn a tiny house, a bed doesn’t have the luxury to be just a bed. It needs to perform multiple functions, where storage is one of the most important ones. The same applies to coffee and night tables, sofas and kitchen elements. Beds can have drawers for your linens, or room for storage under their mattress. Instead of a regular coffee table, opt in for a cube design, where multiple storage drawers are integrated for all those small things you don’t have space for.Customized FurnitureSometimes it is difficult to furnish a tiny home, especially if it doesn’t use a standard floor plan. Customized furniture is a huge advantage in tiny homes, where space is at a premium. You can make sure that every single corner and nook of your house can be used in a functional way. The same applies to storage. A well-placed shelf or locker, can perform a very important function while not taking up much space or by utilizing and otherwise unused space. Customized furniture does come at a premium price, but it is one of those investments you will not lose any sleep over once you are living in your tiny home.Tiny AppliancesEvery piece of furniture and appliance you put into your tiny home, will make you compromise on something else. Tiny living is about downsizing your living space to bare necessities but that has a different meaning for different people. In order to create more space for storing stuff you can’t live without, making some sacrifices when it comes to appliances is important. Instead of a full-sized stove, opt in for a dual heat-plate design that will take up less space. A small refrigerator works fine, just like a large two-door model. Also shopping more frequently for fresh groceries will lead you to a healthier lifestyle and diet. A fold out dinning-table in the kitchen, saves you the space that you might need for a dining table. Tiny appliances and gadgets do tend to have a higher price than standard ones, but they provide so much more than function to tiny home dwellers.","They are also smaller and consume less energy, which is a big bonus."

President Trump had warned of what was coming to prevent these deaths and now it’s time to take urgent action as he’s announced in a shocking message to Americans.With all the focus recently being on Chicago and the immense amount of shooting deaths there are in that war zone every day, a bigger issue has presented itself just a couple states away in Ohio. The Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner has confirmed that 60 people died in February from the same alarming cause, which brings the total deaths from this to 109 this year for just this one small part of Ohio. However, the issue is widespread across the country and only getting worse, which is why Donald Trump wants to do something about it now.Fatal drug overdoses now surpass car deaths in America thanks to the increased use, availability, and abuse of heroin, fentanyl or a combination of the two that come into the country from wide open borders and unchecked immigrants. With each month comes a new record number of deaths from this drug not just in Ohio, but nationwide.“February’s number could increase because seven cases are still awaiting further toxicology testing. Of the fatalities last month, 36 were Cleveland residents,” Fox 8 reported. Trump is well aware of the opioid epidemic that claimed 52,000 lives in 2015, which was the most amount of overdoses in a single year in U.S. History. This is part of the reason he’s wanting to crack down so hard on the border.During his joint address to Congress on Tuesday, the President said that he will build “a great, great wall along our southern border” — in part to dramatically slow the flow of narcotics pouring into the U.S. at an “unprecedented rate.” “Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately stop,” Trump promised in his speech, Vox reported. Although a wall won’t stop it completely, he’s the first to address the epidemic that’s gotten worse while it was ignored the last eight years.While Trump was criticized for his comment that the wall would stop the flow of drugs, it’s a step in the right direction and he’s at least ready to do something about it, whereas his predecessor was not.

politifact15205,1,1,"athy Griffin went off the rails again in another classless display that shows why her career as a comedian hasn’t been as successful as other well-known people much more successful than her.This time Griffin made repulsive comments that have people wondering if she has transitioned to the other gender while she’s been quietly hiding in the backend of the spotlight. In other words, she once again made remarks that would go viral, putting her back in the spotlight, but it’s in such a negative way that most people had to shake their heads and say “eeeeewwwwwww” right after what she said to the Deputy White House Press Secretary Hogan Gidley.Gidley and Griffin were at the same event and Gidley was passing by the table she was sitting at. Griffin snapped at him by asking how he sleeps at night. Gidley replied that he sleeps well and said thanks. Then it seems like she said something else, and he asked if they were going to go at it right there on the spot, and that’s when Griffin went into the full nasty mode and talked with a repulsive next few words that had people questioning her behavior and gender at the same time.Here’s what happened in full detail courtesy of the Washington Blade: “The event is a celebration of the First Amendment. As a longtime LGBT rights advocate, a comedian and provocateur, Griffin has made a long and successful career out of exercising her First Amendment right to free speech. The stunt last year in which she posed with a mock severed head of Donald Trump — which needlessly led CNN to fire her from a longstanding New Year’s Eve hosting gig with Anderson Cooper — was a textbook case of satire, which is constitutionally protected speech.Thus, the decision to invite Griffin proved an easy and obvious one.

I met her and her boyfriend, Randy Bick, on the red carpet and held her purse as she posed for photographers and granted a series of TV interviews. Inside the heavy purse was a stapler; it turns out she suffered a last-minute wardrobe malfunction leaving the hotel, breaking a strap on her gown. After it was repaired, she feared a repeat and asked to borrow the stapler, just in case.She proved a good sport throughout the night, posing for an endless stream of selfies with (mostly gay) fans who congratulated her on surviving the Trump machine’s attacks in the aftermath of the photo scandal. When asked how her famous mom Maggie is at age 96, Griffin replied, “drunk.”The only awkward moment came when Deputy White House Press Secretary Hogan Gidley tried to squeeze past our table. Griffin stopped him and said, “How do you sleep at night?” Gidley replied, “Very well, thank you.” When Griffin expressed doubt about that, Gidley asked, “Are we really going to do this?”That’s when things got interesting. Griffin, in her trademark style, retorted, “Yes we are, suck my d-ck! No, really, suck my d-ck!”There was some back-and-forth, then Gidley, who was holding a Tecate, announced he was off to enjoy his Mexican beer “before we build the wall and you can’t get these anymore.” That prompted a farewell “f-ck you” from Griffin, triggering nervous laughter around our table.”It sure sounds like they had a fun time exchanging comments before Kathy Griffin took it to the levels of a unprofessionalism, acting exactly like the person who couldn’t hold a job with the Squatty Potty.Even though she claims to be a comedian, there’s still a level of professionalism that people should exude when they’re not on stage. Griffin has been unable to differentiate that and consistently confuses real life for her stage life (or lack thereof).Griffin might have some fans, but she","doesn’t have the career she once had because of her antics, which have gone beyond just being funny. She’s now a cautionary tale of what happens when someone can’t or won’t let go of their “funny” ways.”

Please paraphrase: Kathy Griffin made an inappropriate and disrespectful comment to Deputy White House Press Secretary Hogan Gidley at an event, which put her in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons. She asked him how he sleeps at night, and when he replied that he sleeps very well, she asked if they were going to argue right then and there. She then made a crude and offensive remark that left people questioning her behavior and gender. Griffin is a controversial comedian who has had a difficult time maintaining a successful career due to her unprofessional behavior and lack of boundaries between her stage life and real life."

He claims he committed 37 assassinations for the American government between 1959 and 1972, including the actress and model, Marilyn Monroe. Hodges says he has no regrets.In amongst his many confessions, he admits to being a group member of five CIA agents, whose sole task was to carry out assassinations. He also admits one of his assassinations being none other than Glamour icon, Marilyn Monroe, who was killed not just because of her ties with John F Kennedy, but also because she slept with Fidel Castro, ultimately making her a massive national security risk.Hodges says he has no regrets.He claims he carried out 37 assassinations for the US Government between 1959 and 1972 including Marilyn Monroe.Hodges had worked for the CIA.Hodges was a CIA officer for 41 years working as an operative amongst top level security clearances, he claims he was employed as a hit-man by the organization, his duty was to assassinate individuals who posed a threat to the security of the United States of America.He was trained as a sniper and a martial arts expert but also trained in other methods ranging from taking people out with poisons to using explosives.Despite his old age, Hodges has managed to recall each of the assassinations he committed for the CIA. He goes on to admit that the murders were carried out on American soil and by the orders of his then commanding officer, Major James “Jimmy” Hayworth.He also claims the timeline for the assassinations were between August 1959 and March 1972, when the “the CIA had its own agenda”. Furthermore, he admits that he was part of an operation team of five members, who were taking orders to carry out the assassinations. Their victims were from all walks of life ranging from journalists, union leaders, political activists, artists, and scientists – all of which were killed because their radical ideas posed a threat to the interests of the United States.Hodges admits that Marilyn Monroe was the only woman he had ever assassinated, a unique target at the time. He claims she had become a significant “threat to the security of the country” and had to be eliminated.“We had evidence that Marilyn Monroe had not only slept with Kennedy but also with Fidel Castro”, says M. Hodges. “My commanding officer, Jimmy Hayworth, told me that she had to die and that it had to look like a suicide or an overdose. I had never killed a woman before, but I obeyed orders… I did it for America! She could have transmitted strategic information to the communists, and we couldn’t allow that! She had to die! I just did what I had to do!”Marilyn Monroe died on the 5th of August 1962. Hodges claims he entered her room while the star was sleeping, injecting her with a fatal dose of Chloral Hydrate (a very powerful sedative) that was also mixed with Nembutal – a short-acting barbiturate, which ultimately caused her death.The FBI is taking Hodges claims very seriously and has now placed him under custody whilst a full investigation is opened to attempt to verify his allegations.The most important witness in the case would have been Major James Hayworth, who died of a heart attack in 2011. Two other CIA assassins who were identified by Hodges are also dead.This could open up many questions about the CIA’s activities in America in that era. What do you think? Why would Hodges say something like this if it weren’t true? Is it all conspiracy garbage? Let us know your thoughts!","passage: A 78-year-old former CIA officer, Normand Hodges, has made some shocking confessions about his role in assassinations for the American government.

The Obama Administration originally said he was taking the properties in order to punish Russia for meddling in the 2016 election, but that was just a clever ruse to fool the sheeple. To make it look legitimate, he also sanctioned two Russian intelligence services and gave 35 government officials 72 hours to leave the United States.But that was not what any of this was really about. It never is simple or transparent with the criminal Democrats. Obummer’s power play was just a last ditch effort to grab as much free stuff as possible before the door hit him on his corrupt behind on the way out.Once again, we’re really sorry that the poor Obama girls won’t each get a free mansion to trash with their drug, rape and thugs parties.

politifact15579,1,1,"The Second Amendment has continuously been under assault in the United States and in the United Nations. Most often, the attacks came from Democrats and other leftists who have long wanted to see a disarmed populace, with only the government and military maintaining access to firearms. Liberals know that an armed population will not willingly become slaves.The United Nations has long worked, on an international level, to undermine the right of individuals to keep and bear arms, particularly the right of Americans to do so. In a recent document, it sounds like representatives of the United States promised “full implementation” of the UN’s gun-control agreement, and in doing so essentially forfeit the Second and Tenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Perhaps most interestingly of all, the mainstream media has been entirely silent on the issue… perhaps they don’t want to laud this win and stir up patriots?The Third Review Conference for the UN’s Programme of Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons concluded at the end of June. Apparently, American ‘representatives’ at the conference agreed to begin developing ‘legal frameworks’ (generally, laws and regulations) that will enforce “proper management” of “small arms and light weapons” stockpiles.It seems that this agreement also includes ‘stockpiles’ owned by American citizens.The United Nations, an extremely corrupt international government organization with a long track record of failure and few (if any) successes to its name, is hoping that the United States will help it to track (and likely, confiscate) firearms in the country.The conference put out a plan that included demands for a massive database of all organizations, parties, and individuals that manufacture, own, sell, trade, or transfer firearms or ammunition.This will serve as a means for the United Nations to find ‘illicit’ ammunition and firearms.Of course, given the UN’s history of pushing for gun control measures, it’s not beyond the pale to believe that the organization would declare wide swaths of firearms illegal, or that home manufacture of ammunition for private use or resale is illegal.If the United States passes a law, or an executive order, to compel it to cooperate with the UN’s gun control objectives, that could mean that the government would actually seize such equipment on behalf of the international agency.However, it gets worse still. The ‘Programme of Action’ also allows UN ‘peacekeepers’ to go to member nations to ‘assist’ in meeting the goals of the program.So, if the organization decides that the United States should hand over its civilian-owned AR-15s for destruction, and then decides that the process is taking too long, they could send their blue helmet and beret-wearing goons to American shores to ‘help’ speed the process up.The conference produced a list of six points to which all member states agreed.Firstly, they all agreed to establish laws in their nations to support the effective implementation of the Programme of Action (PoA).Secondly, they agreed to strengthen ‘coordinated approaches’ nationally for implementing the PoA.Thirdly, they promised to include women in the mechanism related to said implementation.Fourth, the representatives agreed to create a ‘national point of contact’ to act in the role of liaison between nations and the UN.Fifth, they promised to ‘make better use’ of existing data to push various social and corporate policies in order to be ‘in compliance’ with UN demands concerning women, disarmament, and ‘non-proliferation,’ which generally means not making new firearms for the civilian market.Finally, they agreed to ‘significantly reduce’ illicit flows of small arms through means such as ‘voluntary surrender’ programmes and ‘illicit weapons’ recovery.In other words, the United States government is expected to help push an absurdly anti-Second Amendment set of demands on the American people.If they don’t push that set of rules upon the people swiftly enough, the","UN will send their own goons to do the job for them.The mainstream media is ignoring this disaster, likely because they don’t want to stir up patriotism."

politifact14745,1,0,"Read original article hereLiberals sure are afraid of Roy Moore. Not only did they push a woman in front of the cameras to cry and lie about some stuff that allegedly happened 35 years ago she’s just now remembering to mention (we refuse to repeat the salacious allegations because they are 100% verifiable fake news) but when the fake 14-year-old didn’t work for them, the Democrat Party did something even worse: they doubled down on the story, introduced a new actress, and had her tell an even more horrible lie.Fiona Dourif says she was 11 years old when Moore “groped her in the alley behind the” church they both attended in 1957. “It was the most horrifying moment of my life,” she told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow on Friday night. She then described the series of events that allegedly happened, including the obviously false allegation that he baited her into the alley with candy. “Roy Moore definitely did all of those things and more,” she said looking into the camera, dry-eyed.Maddow then interviewed Dourif’s parents, who said that they knew of the alleged abuse but didn’t say anything until he was running for Senator because they “feared for their lives.” Of course, if that was the case they would not have waited until he had more political power and wealth than he did when this allegedly happened.One piece of information Dourif failed to mention is that she is currently employed as a housekeeper for Michelle Obama at the D.C. mansion “she” and her “husband” Barack share. This information was uncovered by Gateway Pundit’s Charles C. Johnson, who notes in his report that “Dourif is paid extremely well according to public documents, which report a $250,783.33 annual salary for Dourif.”“Why would Barack and Michelle Obama’s housekeeper suddenly remember that she was molested by someone who is running for public office – someone of the opposing party,” Johnson writes. “This stinks more than Malia Obama’s dorm room after one of her reefer parties.”What exactly is going on? Ever since it her employer was revealed, Dourif has gone dark, removing all of her social media presences and refusing to respond to interview requests from any source.","It is not clear whether she is even still employed by the Obamas. However, the information about her employment was well-documented in public records at the time. The only possible explanation for this sudden memory of a traumatic event from over 50 years ago is that Dourif was coached by the DNC to come forward with false allegations against Moore.The DNC, desperate to stop Moore’s campaign, is so panicked by his lead in the polls that they are now resorting to outright lies to try to destroy him. This is a clear case of political sabotage, and it needs to be exposed for what it is.

politifact15123,1,0,"EspañolThe current influenza season has been especially difficult, causing widespread illness that has affected all fifty states and resulted in a record number of hospitalizations. While healthcare professionals continue to combat this year’s flu – which may continue to affect Americans into April – we’re already partnering with other public health agencies to conduct essential work to produce next season’s influenza vaccines.As part of this process, we’re striving to better understand why we saw reduced effectiveness of this year’s influenza vaccines against one strain of influenza A, called H3N2. It was this strain that caused much of the influenza-related illness this flu season. Moreover, this year is not the first time we have seen vaccines be less effective against this particular strain of influenza, H3N2.As such, we are taking a number of actions to better understand why effectiveness tends to be lower against the H3N2 strain and what we can do about it. By looking closely at the available data and applying the lessons we learn each flu season to the vaccine development process, we offer the greatest chance of developing vaccines that even more effectively prevent the flu in the future.These lessons may be applied not only to enhancing the most prevalent process for developing influenza vaccine in eggs, but to considering whether greater investment in alternative processes such as cell-based or recombinant approaches to vaccine development are required. With this statement, I want to outline what we’ve learned so far about this season’s vaccines and the steps we’re taking and plan to take to determine the root cause of this year’s findings and better prepare for future flu seasons.Reduced effectiveness of 2017-2018 seasonal vaccines against H3N2There are a number of theories on why this season’s vaccines produced reduced effectiveness against H3N2. We’re taking steps to investigate each of these potential causes, rule out possible reasons for the variation in effectiveness and improve vaccine efficacy against H3N2. Overall, preliminary vaccine effectiveness reported by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for H3N2 influenza was 25 percent, which means that people who received the vaccine were 25 percent less likely to be sick and need to see a doctor.While that finding isn’t too far off from the vaccine effectiveness seen against H3N2 in previous years, we need to take new steps to improve vaccine efficacy against H3N2. Of note, the effectiveness of the vaccine against H3N2 in children 6 months to 8 years of age was 51 percent this season, yet the effectiveness in those 65 years and older was only 17 percent, and the effectiveness in older children and adults under 65 years of age was even lower. The vaccines did do much better for other viruses that are also causing the flu this season. The data show that overall vaccine effectiveness for H1N1 and influenza B was 67 percent and 42 percent, respectively, for all age groups combined.So why did this season’s vaccines not deliver higher protection against H3N2? And why have vaccines in prior seasons when H3N2 circulated, also delivered reduced protection against this particular flu strain?We don’t think it was a question of getting the particular H3N2 strain wrong when we set out to produce this season’s flu vaccines. Although adapting circulating virus strains for manufacture can lead to differences between the circulating strain and the one used for manufacturing that could affect effectiveness, so far the data we have suggests that the viruses provided by reference laboratories to manufacturers to make this year’s vaccines do reasonably match the circulating flu strains that are causing most of the illnesses, including H3N2.However, we’re working with our colleagues at CDC and other federal agencies to examine and address other factors that might be contributing to the less than optimal overall protection provided by this season’s vaccines against influenz","meeting in the coming weeks. This meeting will consider the recommended strains for the 2018-2019 flu season, which will be based on the data available at the time. The committee will consider the virus strains from the southern hemisphere, which has a summer and fall flu season, as well as any other relevant data and information to make recommendations to the FDA.

The committee will then make recommendations to the FDA on the best strains to include in the 2018-2019 flu vaccine. The FDA will consider the committee’s recommendations and make a final decision on the composition of the vaccine. It’s important to note that the FDA is responsible for ensuring the safety and efficacy of vaccines, and our scientists are committed to working with our partners to continue to improve the flu vaccine. The work we’re doing now is aimed at improving our understanding of why this season’s vaccines were less effective against H3N2, so that we can develop better vaccines in the future. We will continue to follow the data closely and make adjustments as needed."
politifact15525,1,0,"It was June 2014 when the Washington Post reported that illegal immigrants, “including thousands of women and children, stream into south Texas. It was nine months late when the same paper reported that Obama’s border agents were tossing some of those kids into internment camps as an experiment.It was called the Juvenile Referral Process, and it worried human rights groups Mexican officials who feared that it put the kids at risk. The program was the creation of Robert Harris who at the time U.S. Customs and Border Protection commander of the Laredo sector. Harris believed holding certain young Mexicans, believed to be working for cartels in detention serves to get these kids out of the smuggling enterprise. Believed is the operative word, There were no judges, no charges– no trial–just belief.His intelligence analysts estimated that 78 percent of the guides smuggling other migrants were Mexicans younger than 18 — teenagers often hired or conscripted by drug cartels that knew they would not be prosecuted if caught — and he wanted to attack this loophole. “Why don’t we remove these juveniles from the smuggling cycle?” Harris, the outgoing commander of the Laredo sector of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, recalled thinking. Trending: Journalist Laura Loomer Files Assault Charges Against Maxine Waters Now, as a result of that decision, young Mexicans are being held for months without charge in shelters across the United States, sometimes without their parents’ knowledge. Since the program began in May, 536 juveniles have been held — 248 of whom have been deported to Mexico after an average stay of 75 days, according to Border Patrol statistics. Mexican authorities say some of these repeat border-crossers have spent as much as six months in U.S. custody while they await an appearance before an immigration judge. During their detention, they are questioned by U.S. authorities and then transferred to a network of facilities run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, part of the Department of Health and Human Services, across 15 states.Lets put this in perspective, under Trump children are separated from their parents because they don’t want the kids going to jail with their parents. Under Obama, young illegal immigrants were put in “facilities” so they could be squeezed for any information they may or may not have about drug cartels.“Our concern is that the program’s real intent is to interrogate the kids,” said Maureen Meyer, an expert on Mexico and migrants at the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA). The kids are “often questioned about the criminal groups they are working for and then subsequently returned to Mexico with no apparent concern about the implications for them.” While in custody last year [2014], one Mexican boy who worked as a guide shared information with U.S. authorities about the location of stash houses used by migrants as they move through the United States, according to his lawyer’s written summary of his case. When he returned to Mexico, he learned that armed men had forced their way into his home and killed a relative’s son. The men told the family that there had been raids on cartel hideouts and arrests and that they believed the boy was responsible. His half-brother was later killed by the same group. The boy, his lawyer said, has since been in hiding. Harris said the Border Patrol does not have a system to track what happens to the juveniles once they return to Mexico. The program does appear to be discouraging them from returning illegally to Texas, he said. The patrol calculates that just 7 percent of the children who have gone through the program has been picked up again crossing the border.But the program was a surprise to Mexico“The moment it started, it took us all by surprise, because there wasn’t an announcement,” said Reyna Torres Mendívil, director general of the Mexican Foreign Ministry’s office for protection of Mexicans abroad. “Where were they taking these children?”Regarding prevent","ion of the smuggling of minors, Mexican government officials said that they have been working to get more information from the U.S. government on the program. They have not received any information on the program’s specific details, such as how the children are selected, how long they are held, or how they are treated during their detention.Mexican officials also expressed concern about the potential negative impact on the children’s human rights. They are not being given the due process of law, and they are being held in facilities that are not under the Mexican government’s supervision. They are not being treated as refugees but as criminals.Trending: Police Officer’s Widow Calls Out Maxine Waters: ‘You’re a Disgrace to Congress’ Now, in the 12 months that followed, the Washington Post reported that the number of unaccompanied children apprehended at the southwest border had increased by 198 percent. The Post reported that the surge in children was attributed to a variety of factors, including a poor economy and political instability in the children’s home countries. But it was also reported that the surge had been fueled in part by a smuggling operation that had been hiring children to act as guides for the border crossing. The operation had been paying the children as little as $50 per crossing, according to the Post.The article then goes on to report that the number of children being smuggled into the US by drug cartels has increased dramatically. It is reported that these children are being used to guide the cartels’ operations across the border and that they are being paid as little as $50 per crossing. The article also states that these children are being held in facilities across the US and that some have been held for months without charge. This is causing concern for human rights groups who are worried about the potential risks to these children. Mexican officials have also expressed concern about the treatment of these children and the potential risks to their human rights. The article concludes by noting that the program is the creation of Robert Harris, who at the time was the commander of the Laredo sector of US Customs and Border Protection. The program is called the Juvenile Referral Process and it aims to remove young Mexicans from the smuggling cycle by holding them in detention for an extended period without charge. However, the article notes that there are concerns about the potential risks to these children and the lack of transparency around the program.

politifact14205,1,0,"Moscow | National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden has made a new controversial claim yesterday, saying that he possessed some classified information proving that Osama Bin Laden is still alive.Snowden, who lives as a fugitive in Russia after leaking documents about the NSA’s surveillance programs has made some previously unreported allegations about the famous terrorist, Osama Bin Laden, during an interview with the Moscow Tribune.According to him, not only is Bin Laden still alive, but he is living a lavish lifestyle in the Bahamas, thanks to regular payments from the CIA.“I have documents showing that Bin Laden is still on the CIA’s payroll,” claims Edward Snowden. “He is still receiving more than $100,000 a month, which are being transferred through some front businesses and organizations, directly to his Nassau bank account. I am not certain where he is now, but in 2016, he was living quietly in his villa with five of his wives and many children.”Mr. Snowden says the CIA orchestrated the fake death of the former leader of Al Qaeda, while he was actually transported with his family to an undisclosed location in the Bahamas.“Osama Bin Laden was one of the CIA’s most efficient operatives for a long time,” claims the famous whistleblower. “What kind of message would it send their other operatives if they were to let the SEALs kill him? They organized his fake death with the collaboration of the Pakistani Secret services, and he simply abandoned his cover. Since everyone believes he is dead, nobody’s looking for him, so it was pretty easy to disappear. Without the beard and the military jacket, nobody recognizes him.”Mr. Snowden says that the documents proving that Bin Laden is still alive will be integrally reproduced in his new book, expected to be released in September.Edward Snowden was hired by an NSA contractor in 2013 after previous employment with Dell and the CIA. In the month of June of the same year, he revealed thousands of classified NSA documents to journalists.The US government filed espionage charges against him shortly after his revelations were made public. He has been living under asylum in Moscow, after fleeing the US for Hong Kong in the wake of the leaks.On July 28, 2015, the White House has rejected a “We the People” petition of nearly 168,000 signatories, to pardon him.","The petition asked for clemency for Snowden, who has been charged with violating the Espionage Act and other crimes.However, a Gallup poll conducted in June of 2014 found that 53% of Americans believed Snowden was a hero, while only 36% considered him a traitor."
politifact15409,1,1,"CNN is on the verge of permanently closing its doors after its ratings collapsed even more than last week, falling a staggering 30 percent in the second week of May.While Fox News increased its total viewers by a healthy 6 percent and MSNBC held steady, CNN’s viewership took a nosedive, signalling that the failing news network may be about to come to an abrupt end.Breitbart.com reports: While no one in the media want to talk about it, CNN’s relentless fake news sprees have not only created a massive credibility problem for the hate network, the far-left cable channel’s ratings crisis is even more severe.CNN lies.Numbers do not…Last week, during the all-important primetime hours, CNN was only able to average 844K total viewers. During this same week last year, CNN averaged 1.191 million. That is a -29 percent collapse.CNN’s average total day viewers disintegrated by -25 percent, 841K compared to 635K.In other words, throughout the day last week, CNN could only attract an average of 635,000 total viewers.Fox News, however, is thriving. Last week, Fox averaged 2.487 million primetime viewers, nearly three times that of CNN’s 844K, and 1.463 million total day viewers, more than twice CNN’s 635K.While MSNBC is in a distant second place behind Fox, it is still leaving CNN in the dust with an average of 1.667 million primetime viewers and 913K total day viewers.Incredibly, CNN’s second week of May this year was even worse than the first week, which was already catastrophic. During week one, CNN attracted a dismal 859K primetime viewers, but that was still better than week two, which dropped even further to 844K. In total day viewers, the anti-Trump channel dipped from a ruinous week one of just 649K viewers to an even more ruinous week two of 635K.Compared to the full month of May last year, the Stormy Daniels Network is collapsing even more in the advertiser-coveted 25-54 age demo.During the full month of May 2017, CNN average 399K demo viewers during primetime. Last week that number collapsed a whopping -35 percent to just 259K. In total day, the damage was -34 percent, from 274K demo viewers to a humiliating 183K.By comparison, Fox News averaged 492K demo viewers during primetime (almost double CNN) and 296K demo viewers during the total day.MSNBC averaged 326K demo viewers during primetime and 190K during total day.The third week of May is already looking like it could be even worse for CNN. On Monday, despite the massive news surrounding the opening of the American embassy in Jerusalem, CNN averaged a dismal 643K total day viewers, compared to Fox and MSNBC’s 1.76 million and 1.13 million, respectively.During primetime Monday, CNN could only attract a scant 765K total viewers. Fox nearly quadrupled CNN with 2.89 million viewers. MSNBC more than doubled CNN with 1.93 million.The bottom line is that CNN’s ongoing and well-documented credibility crisis has now come home to roost as a five-alarm ratings crisis.","The once-proud news network is now a laughingstock, and its leadership is utterly clueless as to how to fix it.CNN’s fake news obsession, coupled with its reflexive anti-Trump bias, has turned off millions of viewers and advertisers, leaving the network with a death spiral from which it may never recover.The writing is on the wall. CNN’s days are numbered."
politifact13942,1,0,"The government has implemented a new regulation requiring a governor to be placed on all motorcycles by mid-January 2017. The purpose of the mandatory governor would be to prevent motorcyclists from exceeding a speed of 75- miles per hour. The regulation aims to drastically reduce the amount of annual motorcycle fatalities in the United States.Many are not surprised by the regulation as politicians have been asking for stricter safety features to be implemented on motorcycles for the past several decades. In 2014, the government offered all major motorcycle manufactures including Harley-Davidson, Yamaha, Honda, Ducati, Kawasaki, Suzuki, and BMW a large tax-incentive to begin implementing governors on all newly manufactured motorcycles, however to much surprise, all relevant manufactures declined to take advantage of the additional tax-incentive, requiring government officials to return to the drawing board.Members of the U.S. Department of Transportation or U.D.O.T were supportive of the regulation and heavily involved in its roll-out. According to U.S. Department of Transportation representative James Littleton, the motorcycle governor regulation was long past due and made a comparison to the governors placed on traditional automobiles. Littleton told reporters during a press-conference that each year approximately 8,265 motorcycle fatalities occur throughout the United States. According to Littleton, the vast majority (approximately 73%) of motorcycle fatalities are the result of motorcyclists driving at unsafe speeds.When asked why the regulation would only allow motorcyclists to maintain a speed below 75-miles per hour, Littleton made the following comment to reporters, “This is a crucial safety regulation that should have been implemented at least 20-years ago, now that we are finally implementing it, we want to ensure we do it right. With the exception of a few states that allow for 80-miles per mile freeway driving (Idaho, Montana, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming) and Texas who allows for speeds of up to 85-miles per hour on the freeway, most states allow a maximum speed of 75-miles per hour. We wanted to make it easy for motorcyclists in most all states to easily obey their respective posted speed limit.”According to Littleton, motorcyclists in the few states that periodically allow for speeds exceeding 75-miles per hour, governors allowing speeds up to 80-85-miles per hour may eventually be implemented, however in the meantime, police officials in these states have been given direction to avoid citing motorcyclists for such infractions as obstructing the flow of traffic when relevant.Officials expect all motorcyclists and motorcycle manufactures to be in compliance with the new regulation by mid to late January 2017, however may file for a temporary 30, 60, or 90-day extension under select circumstances. According to Littleton, citations and fines will be imposed on both motorcyclists and motorcycle manufactures who fail to remain in compliance with the regulation.According to Littleton, designated motorcycle mechanic and auto-body shops in each state will be permitted to install the mandatory governors on motorcycles manufactured and sold prior to the implementation of the regulation at a subsidized rate. Littleton did not have details regarding the government subsidized repair readily available, however told reporters that he expects the subsidized cost to be around $35 to the consumer.Littleton concluded the press conference by informing reporters that the U.S Department of Transportation is currently working diligently to release all relevant information pertaining to the new regulation on the U.D.O.T website.",He also announced that a dedicated customer service hotline will be established to assist consumers with any questions or concerns they may have regarding the new mandatory governors.

What type of heaven would you envisage if you were paid to stay in bed; it would be a glorious one wouldn’t it? If only it were possible!!! But!! Hold it right there, don’t be disappointed because what if we told you it is possible!! You can get paid a huge sum of money just staying in bed for two whole months and by you know who?? NASA no less!!!Yes the American space agency NASA is paying $100,000 to stay in bed for 60 days. Find out why and if it is really too good to be true.Most of us dream about hanging out in bed, all day, every day, and getting paid for it! Well, it turns out NASA are making our dreams a reality. A few lucky candidates are getting paid an obscene amount of money just to chill in bed all day.NASA is currently on the lookout for people to participate in their “Bed Rest Studies”, in which participants will have to stay in bed for 60 days straight.It does sound like the dream job, right? But how long do you think you could last without going insane.I would definitely treat the 60 days like a job, and whenever I felt like I’d had enough, I’d just think of all the things I could buy with the money.You wouldn’t just be sleeping you can keep yourself occupied with books, TV, video games, and they can also use their phones as they please!As long as they remain laying down. You’re probably thinking what on earth is the point in this experiment.NASA want to study how the body reacts to extended periods of rest for astronauts who are going on extended periods of space travel.NASA says the experiments is designed to achieve three things:Understanding how one’s changing physiology in space may affect the process of certain missions.Understanding the impact of one’s physiological state on their ability to perform in particular tasks.Preparing countermeasures to combat any impairment that these physiological conditions may impose.The experiment will consist of two categories.The exercising group, are able to exercise using special tools that help them stay active while still lying down. While non-exercising groups must stay completely at rest the entire time.During the entirety of the study, bone, muscle and heart tests, will be done.As well as tests of the circulatory and nervous systems, nutritional condition, and the body’s capacity to fight off infections are conducted.","So, if you’re feeling adventurous and fancy getting paid to laze about in bed for 60 days, you can apply for the NASA Bed Rest Studies.

The passage is about a job opening for NASA where they are paying $100,000 to stay in bed for 60 days. The job is called “Bed Rest Studies” and the purpose of this study is to research how the body reacts to extended periods of rest for astronauts who are going on extended periods of space travel. The study is divided into two categories: exercising group and non-exercising group. The exercising group can exercise using special tools while the non-exercising group must stay completely at rest. Throughout the study, various tests are conducted on the body to understand how it changes with prolonged rest. The job is open for anyone who wants to apply."

Neither, according to the State Board of Elections.The true explanation is much less exciting.Prior to passage of the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) in 1993, the state did not require those registering to provide their birth date. While most voters who registered before NVRA did provide birth dates, some did not. These voters were automatically assigned a default birth date of 01/01/1900 in the state’s voter rolls.

China on Monday rejected Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s comment on the South China Sea dispute, urging Japan to be cautious and respect the efforts made by countries directly concerned.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lu Kang made the statement at a regular press conference, saying that China is the largest and most important country in the region and is entitled to uphold its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests.He added that China’s position on the South China Sea dispute is clear and consistent, and any country outside the region should respect the efforts made by countries directly concerned to maintain peace and stability in the region and not intervene or take sides.Lu also expressed the hope that Japan will respect the rules of the international community, uphold the principles of the United Nations Charter, and not engage in any activities that may complicate or exacerbate regional disputes.Abe on Sunday expressed his concern over the situation in the South China Sea and called on all countries to respect freedom of navigation and overflight and peaceful settlement of disputes in accordance with international law.Meanwhile, China’s National Bureau of Statistics announced on Monday that the country’s GDP growth reached 6.3 percent in the first quarter of this year, marking the highest growth rate since the first quarter of 2015.The growth rate is also higher than the same period last year, indicating that China’s economy is maintaining a moderately fast growth momentum. 此文章可能存在一些误传或误解，请大家谨慎理解。-著名博主徐青哥。2023年3月29日 下午9:08:46 来源：CCTV网负责人：负责人编辑：16809016471 来源：CCTV网 【关键词】南海碳排疫 南海游荡轮 南海疫情 南海防护 南海海滩 南海旅游 南海游荡轮车疫情 南海旅游业 南海游荡轮防疫 南海游荡轮封锁 南海游荡轮抗疫 南海旅游业危机 南海游荡轮封锁危机 南海旅游业危机抗疫 南海游荡轮封锁抗疫 南海旅游业危机抗疫措施 南海游荡轮封锁抗疫措施 南海游荡轮封锁抗疫舆论 南海游荡轮封锁抗疫议论 南海游荡轮封锁抗疫防疫措施 南海游荡轮封锁抗疫防疫措施舆论 南海游荡轮封锁抗疫防疫措施议论 南海游荡轮封锁抗疫防疫措施舆论 南海�������������"
politifact15048,1,0,"It’s no surprise that one of the most hated people in the entire world is George Soros. This liberal billionaire has used his massive wealth and resources to essentially control the Democratic Party. Which is why if Hillary Clinton had won the presidential election, she would have been listening to Soros.When you’re done imaging that nightmare scenario, it’s important to realize that the fight isn’t over yet. Hillary might have lost the election, but Soros is still out there, mobilizing and planning more moves that seek to dismantle the Donald Trump presidency.That’s why Trump finally had enough and is going to charge Soros as a “threat to national security” in the United States. Considering that this is the same man that has mobilized and paid protesters to create a tremendous amount of damage, it’s been a long time coming for this order.Trump had placed a call to Russia to ask about “any and all” files that are related to Soros. He was able to do this thanks to the 2014 Executive Order that was signed by President Obama, entitled “Blocking Property of Certain Persons Contributing to the Situation in Ukraine.”“I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, find that the actions and policies of persons that undermine democratic processes and institutions in Ukraine; threaten its peace, security, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity; and contribute to the misappropriation of its assets, constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat.”Nearly a month after this order was signed US diplomatic cables show that Soros did “undermine the processes and institutions in Ukraine.” Due to Soros’s illegal intervention into a peaceful transition of power, mass conflict erupted and an estimated 9,600 men, women, and children lost their lives.Clearly that is interfering in the process. So why didn’t President Obama charge Soros as a threat to the United States national security? It’s because Soros flooded Obama and Hillary’s Democratic Party with about $100 million in donations. You really think that Obama is going to charge someone that has donated that much to their party?Soros began his takeover back in 2004, as he declared “it is the central focus of my life” and “a matter of life and death” to push his influence on the American people and our democracy. While 2004 failed, Soros had turned to 2016 and had become Hillary’s highest donor. We know that Hillary listens to people that donate to her, so she would have been listening to Soros the entire time.Now that the Democratic Party has been completely defeated, Soros is doing what he can to go against President Trump, saying “democracy is now in crisis.” Soros has been active in his fight against Trump, as he was discovered to have been the mastermind behind paying protesters to cause as much damage and destruction as possible.During the election season, there were several Black Lives Matter protests that quickly turned violent. These protesters started riots, went up against the police force, and generally made life difficult for law-abiding citizens. Then came a report that Soros was paying these protesters around $15 an hour to protest, and they would have their expenses paid for.It didn’t just stop at the Black Lives Matter protests either. There were several protests against Trump during the election season that turned violent. Again, another report circulated that protesters were getting paid to cause as much destruction as possible.Considering that one of these protests actually shut down a speech that Trump had planned to make, it’s safe to say that they were effective at the time. Not to mention that these people were endangering other people around them and creating a lot of problems for the police forces that were assigned to them.It’s about time that Trump did something against Soros. This man has been responsible for fund",ing and organizing some of the most violent and destructive protests in the world. He has also been accused of manipulating financial markets and influencing political outcomes. He is a clear and present danger to the United States and its people. It’s time that something is done about it.
politifact14426,1,0,"James Fields, from Ohio, arrested following attack at ‘Unite the Right’ gathering, and two police officers die in helicopter crashA man has been arrested and charged with murder after a car rammed into a group of people peacefully protesting against a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, killing one person and injuring 19.Police said a 32-year-old woman had died and that they were attempting to notify her family before releasing more details.Col Martin Kumer, the superintendent of Albemarle-Charlottesville regional jail, told the Guardian that 20-year-old James Fields, of Ohio, had been arrested following the attack on Saturday.Facebook Twitter Pinterest James Fields was charged with second-degree murder. Photograph: Albemarle County Jail/AFP/Getty Images“He has been charged with second degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and failing to stop at an accident that resulted in a death,” Kumer said in an email.Donald Trump condemned the “violence on many sides”, but faced criticism for failing to directly denounce the far-right demonstrators.In a separate incident, two police officers died when their helicopter, which was monitoring the far-right rally, crashed outside Charlottesville.State police said in a statement the helicopter was “assisting public safety resources with the ongoing situation” when it crashed in a wooded area. The pilot, Lieutenant H Jay Cullen, 48, of Midlothian, Virginia, and Trooper-pilot Berke Bates of Quinton, Virginia, died at the scene.The deaths came at the end of a day marked by violent clashes between far-right nationalists and people who had come to protest against their occupation of a downtown park containing a statue of the Confederate general Robert E Lee.Witnesses said those hit by the car were peacefully protesting against the white supremacist rally and footage showed the vehicle crashing into another car, throwing people over the top of it.Play Video 1:34 Virginia governor says 'go home' to white supremacists and nazis – videoCharlottesville: far-right crowd with torches encircles counter-protest group Read moreThe photographer Pat Jarrett, who witnessed the incident, said: “A gray Dodge Charger plowed into a sedan and then into a minivan. Bodies flew. People were terrified and screaming. Those closest to it said it was definitely a violent attack. The driver, who people later described as a skinny white guy with a straggly beard, reversed out of there and drove off, the front end of his car all smashed up.”Charlottesville mayor Mike Signer tweeted: “I am heartbroken that a life has been lost here. I urge all people of good will – go home.”Speaking at a press conference on Saturday evening, the governor of Virginia, Terry McAuliffe, who had earlier declared a state of emergency, told the white supremacists: “Go home … Shame on you. You pretend you are patriots, but you are anything but a patriot.”The mother of Fields told the Associated Press on Saturday night that she knew her son was attending a rally in Virginia but didn’t know it was a white supremacist rally.“I thought it had something to do with Trump. Trump’s not a white supremacist,” Samantha Bloom said, before becoming visibly upset as she learned of the injuries and deaths at the rally “He had an African-American friend …,” she said before her voice trailed off.Responding to the events in Charlottesville from Bedminster, New Jersey, Trump: “We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides.”But the Republican senator Marco Rubio tweeted that it was important for Trump to describe the events as a “terror attack by white supremacists”.The FBI said it was opening a civil rights investigation into the accident along with the justice department’s civil rights division and the district attorney’s office.The US attorney general, Jeff Sessions, said: “The violence and deaths in Charlottesville strike at the heart of American law and j","“We’re not going to let hate come into this city.” One woman was seen bleeding from the head and another was being treated by medics.A car crashed into a crowd of protesters later in the day, killing one person and injuring 19.

They eventually gathered in McIntire Park, where they were met by hundreds of counter-protesters.One counter-protester, who gave her name as Misty, said: “We’re here to fight hate with love. We’re not going to let them come in here and spew their hate.”She added: “We’re not going to let them take over our city.”Another counter-protester, who gave her name as Caitlin, said: “This is not a free speech rally. This is a hate rally. They don’t have the right to come in here and spread their hate.”Speaking earlier in the day, the city’s mayor, Mike Signer, said: “I have a message to the white supremacists who came into our city: go home. You are not welcome in this city. You are not welcome in this state. You are not welcome in this country.”However, in the evening, the governor of Virginia, Terry McAuliffe, declared a state of emergency and called in the National Guard to “ensure public safety and prevent violence”.He said: “I am declaring a state of emergency to ensure the safety of all Virginians and to restore peace and order to our commonwealth.”White supremacists and neo-Nazis clashed with counter-protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Saturday, resulting in at least one death and several injuries.

politifact14940,1,0,"Full text: Jeff Flake on Trump speech transcriptPrepared remarks for Sen. Jeff Flake, who delivered a speech to the Senate on Jan. 17, 2018.Mr. President, near the beginning of the document that made us free, our Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson wrote: “We hold these truths to be self-evident...” So, from our very beginnings, our freedom has been predicated on truth. The founders were visionary in this regard, understanding well that good faith and shared facts between the governed and the government would be the very basis of this ongoing idea of America.Story Continued BelowAs the distinguished former member of this body, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, famously said: “Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not to his own facts.” During the past year, I am alarmed to say that Senator Moynihan’s proposition has likely been tested more severely than at any time in our history.It is for that reason that I rise today, to talk about the truth, and its relationship to democracy. For without truth, and a principled fidelity to truth and to shared facts, Mr. President, our democracy will not last.2017 was a year which saw the truth – objective, empirical, evidence-based truth -- more battered and abused than any other in the history of our country, at the hands of the most powerful figure in our government. It was a year which saw the White House enshrine “alternative facts” into the American lexicon, as justification for what used to be known simply as good old-fashioned falsehoods. It was the year in which an unrelenting daily assault on the constitutionally-protected free press was launched by that same White House, an assault that is as unprecedented as it is unwarranted. “The enemy of the people,” was what the president of the United States called the free press in 2017.The most reliable politics newsletter.

You can unsubscribe at any time.Mr. President, it is a testament to the condition of our democracy that our own president uses words infamously spoken by Josef Stalin to describe his enemies. It bears noting that so fraught with malice was the phrase “enemy of the people,” that even Nikita Khrushchev forbade its use, telling the Soviet Communist Party that the phrase had been introduced by Stalin for the purpose of “annihilating such individuals” who disagreed with the supreme leader.This alone should be a source of great shame for us in this body, especially for those of us in the president’s party. For they are shameful, repulsive statements. And, of course, the president has it precisely backward – despotism is the enemy of the people. The free press is the despot’s enemy, which makes the free press the guardian of democracy. When a figure in power reflexively calls any press that doesn’t suit him “fake news,” it is that person who should be the figure of suspicion, not the press.I dare say that anyone who has the privilege and awesome responsibility to serve in this chamber knows that these reflexive slurs of “fake news” are dubious, at best. Those of us who travel overseas, especially to war zones and other troubled areas around the globe, encounter members of U.S. based media who risk their lives, and sometimes lose their lives, reporting on the truth. To dismiss their work as fake news is an affront to their commitment and their sacrifice.According to the International Federation of Journalists, 80 journalists were killed in 2017, and a new report from the Committee to Protect Journalists documents that the number of journalists imprisoned around the world has reached 262, which is a new record. This total includes 21 reporters who are being held on “false news” charges.Mr. President, so powerful is the presidency that the damage done by the sustained attack on the truth will not be confined to the president’s time in ","cause of truth, we can restore the American idea. And together, we must. Thank you.EndText


Paragraph: Senator Jeff Flake (R-AZ) delivered a speech on January 17, 2018, in which he expressed concern about the state of truth in America. Flake argued that the truth is the foundation of freedom and that the country's democracy will not last if it cannot defend itself against lies and misinformation. Flake criticized the president for using ""alternative facts"" and calling the free press ""fake news,"" which he said was a shameful and repulsive statement. Flake also pointed out that journalists around the world risk their lives to report the truth, and that it is the responsibility of those in power to respect and protect them. Finally, Flake called on Congress and the American people to stand up for the truth in 2018 and to work together to restore the American idea."
politifact14289,1,0,"It is being reported that Australia is becoming the first nation in the world to begin microchipping its citizens. This surprising new development is the result of several years of a sustained propaganda that has actually led to Australian citizens voluntarily putting themselves forward for the controversial program.Australia is getting its citizens microchippedShanti Korporaal, who lives in the Australian city of Sydney has found herself at the center of headlines of the new venture after having implants surgically implanted in both of her hands. She says that she has no regrets about the procedure and that she encourages others to follow in her footsteps. The implants are fitted with a unique identifier which can be used to get through locked doors, to transfer personal information into devices and even connected to bank details. ""You could set up your life, so you never have to worry about any passwords or PINs, ""Korporaal told reporters when justifying her decision. Another anonymous individual who had also voluntarily undergone the procedure said that they had done it for the purpose of ‘convenience.'But while it may be convenient in the short-term, the long-term implications of having microchips implanted directly into the human body are terrifying. Modern technology has allowed the government and law enforcement agencies an almost unprecedented level of access to the details of the lives of ordinary citizens. In the United States, there are regular reports that indicate that law enforcement agencies such as the police and the FBI are already tracking cell phones without a warrant on a fairly routine basis. In addition to this, revelations by the whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed that the government is accessing and storing a vast amount of information about every single person, whether they are under suspicion or not, from their online devices.This means that civil liberties campaigners are deeply concerned about this burgeoning trend of microchipping which will essentially allow the government to have a permanent record of a citizen’s every movement and transaction. After all, the only way to remove a surgically implanted microchip is another painful operation. Civil liberties advocates are baffled by the way private citizens are actually volunteering to forego their privacy and security in such an intrusive manner.","Microchipping citizens in Australia is a new development that has been prompted by several years of propaganda that has convinced citizens to voluntarily undergo the procedure.

politifact15304,1,0,"USDA approves slaughterhouses producing horse meat for human consumptionYou might have to train your taste buds to get used to horse meat soon, because FYI: The U.S. government just approved the operation of horse meat slaughterhouses to produce meat for human consumption.New Mexico, Missouri and Iowa are just some of the areas where horse meat plants are expected to be approved by the USDA. While horse meat, technically, can’t be legally sold in the United States for human consumption, it may still turn up in the US food supply because it can be sold to Mexico, then re-labeled and shipped back to the USA as a low-cost meat filler. This has already been documented occurring in Europe, where meatballs sold in European grocery stores were found to be made with horse meat.Where do these horses come from?While horse meat slaughterhouses were banned during the Bush Administration, the ban expired in 2011 under President Obama’s watch, thereby allowing horse meat slaughterhouses to restart operations.Reuters claims that around 130,000 horses are slaughtered each year in Canada and Mexico — and it seems the United States wants a huge chunk of that business, as well.Not-so-fun fact: Most horse meat come from horse owners who decide to have their horses killed for a variety of reasons, such as illness, injury, or simply because they cannot afford to keep their horses fed and cared for anymore.Many of these owners sell their horses to slaughterhouses for an incredibly low amount. Yep, you read that right: They allow strangers to haul their horses away to a meat packing plant, only to be slaughtered mercilessly around several other screaming horses.Do keep all this in mind the next time you consider buying a horse for your family. Raising one requires a tremendous amount of effort, so be a responsible horse owner. Don’t let your pet get slaughtered once you get tired of it — because if you do, it might eventually end up on your plate the next time you purchase some meatballs for your spaghetti.Source used:NaturalNews.com",.
