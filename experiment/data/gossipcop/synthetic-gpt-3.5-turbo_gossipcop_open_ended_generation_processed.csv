gossipcop-938421,"Let Zayn entertain you! The singer gets frisky with a stripper in his new video for ‘Entertainer!’ Watch here!  Zayn Mailk and model Sofia Jamora are at it again in his latest music video for “Entertainer.” In it, Sofia is seen rocking a blonde wig, which gives her more Kylie Jenner vibes than Gigi Hadid, but she’s in the dressing room of a strip club while Zayn walks the streets smoking a cig. The vid is a continuation of his last hit, “Let Me,” in which Zayn is essentially in Scarface and he and Sofia escape the bad guys on a boat. This time, Zayn enters the club and sees his love interest, while singing, “Guess you didn’t know that you were my favorite entertainer, I watch you, laugh with and f–k with you. Don’t you take me for a fool. In this game, I own the rules.” Damn.  As a bleach blonde Zayn spots Sofia, he has flashbacks to their “Let Me” rendezvous. Once Sofia starts dancing on him, he recalls their hotel hook up and we’re not gonna lie, it’s super hot. Sofia the stripper keeps looking up at a camera, recording she and Zayn in the club, and tell him she’ll BRB. Except Zayn flashes back again to Sofia leaving him in the hotel room and disappearing without a trace. She does it again, this time in the club, and leaves a hopeless Zayn alone once more. He sees her take off in a black car and watches her go.  The final scene shows Zayn standing alone on a dock with a suitcase, clearly ready for his next adventure. This time, there is no “To be continued…” We can’t help but wonder, was this a message to Gigi after she broke up with him? “Thought that you were smarter, I’m ashamed for you. I knew it right away when you stopped lovin’ me. It happened when your touch wasn’t enough for me,” the former One Directioner sings. Well, luckily, we know he got the girl again in reality, as he and Gigi have been spotted together since announcing their break-up. Fingers crossed!",0,en,0,"Let Zayn entertain you!

Dancing With the Stars will return for its 22nd season with Len Goodman back where he belongs, Bindi Irwin as the reigning champ, and a baby boy or girl for Allison Holker. There's much to look forward to, but not before we close out this season one last time with everything that happened after the finale! (In case you missed it, you can read our recap of the best and worst moments here .) Almost an hour after Tom Bergeron declared Bindi Irwin and Derek Hough the winners of season 21, Bindi was still in disbelief, shouting from the top of her lungs, ""I think I'm going to scream for 20 minutes!"" Her exuberance and genuine nature endeared her to literally every one on set, but no one more so than Derek. ""It's just so special with Bindi,"" he told reporters backstage. ""She's a champion of life."" Bindi shared the same sentiment, telling those in the ballroom that she gained another brother in Derek. In case you needed further proof that the two are friends for life, consider this: Derek's hopping on a plane to Australia in a couple weeks ""to tackle crocodiles and get my official khakis!"" The Houghster may have nabbed his sixth Mirrorball trophy, but it was his partnership with Bindi that undoubtedly made it his favorite season. ""There's not a thing I would change about this season,"" he told Glamour post-show. ""There's not a week I would change, a dance I would change, and that was a very calming, very peaceful feeling. The show is a completely different show than the first time I won, and to win at this level and the standard that this show has been raised to, it's been incredible."" While Bindi and Derek make the press rounds in New York City, it's no secret that she's itching to get back to her hometown down under. ""I can't wait to get back to all the animals, continue all the conservation work, and carry on in my dad's footsteps."" Season 21 runner-ups Sharna Burgess and Nick Carter were understandably disappointed not to win the big prize, but they both praised Bindi and Derek for their phenomenal journey this season. ""Bindi was the whole package,"" praised the red-haired stunner. ""She and Derek had a beautiful partnership."" Still, ""it's bittersweet in may ways. Did I really want this to be my first Mirrorball? Absolutely. I would be lying if I said I didn't. But Bindi was undeniable this entire season. She grew so much, and she's just such a beautiful person you can't help but be captivated by her. Both [she and Nick] are winners, and I truly believe that."" Echoed Nick: ""It was just such a pleasure to be here. I didn't expect to get anything, so anytime something great happened in the competition, it was a pleasant surprise to me."" So what's up next for Nick? Well, aside from getting ready for Baby Boy Carter , his solo album ( All American ) drops today, and he has a movie coming out next year that he wrote and directed. As for third-place contestant, Alek Skarlatos , he'll be heading on the DWTS Tour this winter, but his immediate plans are much simpler: ""I can't wait to get on the plane tonight to eat. A lot."" But what about his dating life? Any updates on that? ""It's been pretty crazy, honestly. [I haven't had time] for many dates lately."" Added Lindsay: ""I'll be his wing woman on tour!"" During all the hectic action backstage, Allison Holker was a ball of energy, especially for someone six month's pregnant. ""I feel incredible!"" gushed the pro. ""Dancing around with a baby that's the size of a football in your belly is never an easy task, but it's been amazing. Although I never expected to see myself in a sparkly costume on the Dancing With the Stars stage six months pregnant!"" Allison (and husband tWitch) will find out the baby's gender on December 10, ""which is our anniversary too."" In case you're wondering, she'll reveal whether it's a boy or a girl on social media shortly thereafter! In the meantime, Allison's prepping for her first Thanksgiving in charge of the turkey as long as the ne",1,en,"Mark March 21, 2016 on your calendar. Dancing With the Stars will return for its 22nd season with Len Goodman back where he belongs, Bindi Irwin as the reigning champ, and a baby boy or girl for Allison Holker.","Mark March 21, 2016 on your calendar as Dancing With the Stars makes a highly anticipated comeback for its 22nd season. Fans of the popular dance competition show can expect an enthralling line-up of talented celebrities, impeccable choreography, and, perhaps, even some delightful surprises.

One significant reason to celebrate the return of this iconic show is the comeback of the esteemed Len Goodman. Renowned for his sharp critiques and his encyclopedic knowledge of ballroom dance, Goodman will be reclaiming his rightful place as one of the show's skilled judges. His absence in the previous season was felt deeply by fans and contestants alike, and his return is sure to bring back that much-needed blend of expertise, wit, and charm that viewers have come to adore.

Another exciting element awaiting fans is the reigning champ, Bindi Irwin. The y oung conservationist and daughter of the late Steve Irwin captured the hearts of both the judges and audiences in the previous season. Bindi's notable talent, infectious enthusiasm, and genuine love for dance not only earned her the prestigious mirrorball trophy but also established her as an inspiration to many aspiring dancers around the world. Her participation in the upcoming season promises to be nothing short of awe-inspiring.

Adding to the enthusiasm surrounding this season is the joyous news of a precious addition to professional dancer Allison Holker's family. With her undeniable grace and incredible talent, Holker has become a beloved member of the Dancing With the Stars family. Now, fans can share in her happiness as she embarks on an exciting journey into motherhood. Whether it's a baby boy or girl, this joyous blessing will undoubtedly be a source of inspiration for Holker and a heartwarming addition to the show.

As we prepare to witness the brilliance, passion, and dazzling personalities of this promising cast, we can only anticipate the excitement and grandeur that Dancing With the Stars' 22nd season is set to bring. So, grab your calendars and mark this date, as March 21, 2016, will surely be a night to remember as the stars light up the stage once again in pursuit of the coveted mirrorball trophy."

And no one’s been on the receiving end of that criticism more than Taylor Swift. Despite a lengthy catalogue of hits in which she plays scorned exes and lovelorn balladeers, the country singer turned pop superstar has been seen less as a victim than as a purveyor of victimhood, using her prodigious songwriting talents and natural affability to become a megaphone for perceived injustice. So what does Taylor Swift do to prove to us she’s aware of this narrative (the one, of course, from which she’d like to be excluded)? Acid gossip that borrows from better songs – Taylor Swift: Look What You Made Me Do review Read more Release a music video – for her new single, Look What You Made Me Do – that’s practically boiling over with meta-commentary and self-referential detail, from an ongoing visual snake motif to a tombstone that literally reads “Taylor Swift’s reputation”. Yes, it’s painfully on-the-nose, but Swift’s brand hasn’t exactly been built on subtlety. Look What You Made Me Do – or LWYMMD, as its Twitter hashtag dictates – is well on its way to smashing streaming records, but the song hasn’t been as well received by critics. Continuing in the tradition of her last album, 1989, which marked Swift’s official evolution into pop music behemoth, it largely abandons that which made her a household name – singable melodies; sharp, specific lyricism; grand tales of romantic enchantment – in favor of radio-engineered pop and glib proclamations of vengeance. Near the end of the song, she answers a phone call; someone’s asking to speak with Taylor Swift. “She can’t come to the phone right now,” Swift 2.0 says. Why? “Because she’s dead.” In the battle between Swifts, my allegiance is with the deceased version, a shrewd chronicler of young-adult courtship and seasoned, starry-eyed songwriter. So much so that hearing her new single made me nostalgic for the days of Fearless and Red. But the Old Swift be damned; this new one is all about retribution and, as the title of her forthcoming album suggests, reputation. The music video for LWYMMD, which premiered during Sunday night’s VMAs, sees Swift double down on her vengeful streak, making theatre of her scandal-laden career in an attempt to communicate a self-awareness that’s mostly eluded her. The video is good fun, if a little bit mad; it’s certainly the most brazen and ambitious pop music video since Beyoncé dropped Lemonade in the spring of last year, replete with pyrotechnics and dozens of costume changes. But it doesn’t amount to much more than a succession of disconnected images. And if the images could talk, they might say, “I know what you think of me”, or, perhaps, in the words of Joanne the Scammer: “I’m a messy bitch who lives for drama.” But still, in all those images, Swift left a lot to be decoded. A connoisseur of the tongue-in-cheek (remember the capitalized letters in her lyric booklets that spelled out clues about a song’s subject?), it begins with a zombified T-Swift digging her own grave. Get it? The Old Swift is dead, dunzo, kaput, resigned to the graveyard of pop culture history.

In the next shot, Swift luxuriates in a tub of diamonds, where there sits a single dollar bill, a possible reference to the symbolic dollar she earned in last month’s sexual assault case against the radio DJ who groped her in 2013. Internet conspiracists, too, ran with this as a visual reference to Melania Trump, who could be seen forking diamond necklaces like spaghetti in a Vanity Fair spread last year. But those were the same people insistent that Swift, who kept mum during last year’s presidential campaigns, is a closeted Trump supporter. That the election coincided with Swift’s period of self-imposed exile did little to get her back in the public’s good graces; but diamonds, unlike gilded toilet seats, do not a Trump reference make. This next one is a dead giveaway: Swift sits atop a throne as dozens of snakes slither at her feet. One even serves her what we can only assume is piping hot tea, the kind Kim Kardashian dished out when she released audio of Swift, who publicly disputed Kanye West’s lyric about her in Famous, appearing to sign off on those same lyrics in a phone conversation with West. Afterwards, Swift’s reputation as a snake in sheep’s clothing took off; Kardashian helped further that image by tweeting a bunch of snake emojis on international snake day. More than a year later, it seems Swift’s ready to embrace the title: ahead of the single’s release, she dropped cryptic reptilian teaser videos. And now, the snake has shed her skin. There’s also an inscription on Swift’s gold throne that reads “Et Tu Brute”, the Latin phrase used in William Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar when Caesar is being assassinated by his friend Brutus. It’s a far cry from the Swift of yesteryear, whose Shakespeare references were more Romeo and Juliet than Julius Caesar. But she’s dead, remember? It was at the 2016 Grammys, when 1989 beat Kendrick Lamar’s To Pimp a Butterfly for album of the year, that Swift first began to truly test the public’s patience. That was also where she publicly rebuked West’s"
gossipcop-2761931201,"Lou Rocco/Getty Images  How Michael Strahan’s net worth was built  Michael Strahan has grown his wealth through 14 years of playing pro football and his second career as a talk-show host.  The son of an Army major, Strahan grew up in Germany and did not play competitive high school football until his senior year when his parents sent him to live with his aunt and uncle in Texas.  The former defensive end played well enough to earn a scholarship to Texas Southern University. By his senior year of college, he had set a record for sacks, which got the attention of the NFL.  In 1993, the New York Giants drafted Strahan as the 40th overall draft pick. Over the next 14 seasons, he became the league’s all-time quarterback sack leader, played in the Pro Bowl and helped the Giants defeat the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLII.  Upon retiring in 2008, Strahan concentrated on his off-field talents. In 2012, he became Kelly Ripa’s “Live! With Kelly” co-host, replacing longtime host Regis Philbin.

(This is always an exciting moment in a ceremony.) It was an extraordinary mix of tradition and modernity, of centuries of history and up-to-the moment flourishes. Oprah was here, and so was Meghan’s mother, an African-American social worker who wore a conventional mother-of-the-bride outfit and also a nose stud. It somehow looked charming and just right. The entire royal family was here, along with a complement of English aristocrats and important personages. The music was stately and beautiful. The setting was awe-inspiring. There was a flotilla of clergymen, an extraordinary mélange including the archbishop of Canterbury and — in a striking inclusion in this most ancient of places — the head of the Episcopal Church, the Most Rev. Michael Curry. Chosen to give the address to the congregations, Bishop Curry, who is African-American, quoted Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. His voice rising and falling with emotion, he made a big, generous, impassioned case for love as the most important thing there is, in religion and in life. His address came after a reading by Lady Jane Fellowes, Harry’s aunt (her sister was Diana, Princess of Wales) that was both full of joy and a signal, it seemed, that the sadness in Harry’s life since his mother’s death had finally lifted. It was a passage from the Song of Solomon: “Arise my love, my fair one, and come away; for now the winter is past, the rain is over and gone.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story The dress was a success: sculptural simplicity. Photo Our fashion critic, Vanessa Friedman, is also watching, and she has a quick take for us on Meghan Markle’s dress. It was absolutely simple: pure and sculptural, in double bonded silk cady with a wide boatneck, long sleeves and sweeping train. It was Meghan Markle’s wedding dress. It was by Clare Waight Keller, a British woman and the first female designer of Givenchy. And it was everything people had hoped. This was not a Cinderella choice, not one that spoke of fantasy or old-fashioned fairy tales. Instead, it placed the woman proudly front and center and underscored Ms. Markle’s own independence. At the same time, it celebrated female strength, promoted a local designer and reached a hand across to Europe (where Ms. Waight Keller has a day job). The five-meter veil was of silk tulle, with a trim of hand-embroidered flowers in silk threads and organza, and contained embroidery representing the flora of all 53 Commonwealth nations. Video And it was entirely a surprise. In all the rumors that had swirled around The Dress, from Ralph & Russo to Stella McCartney, Ms. Waight Keller’s name had never come up. In the end, Ms. Markle outthought us all. As this starts, long may it continue. And the After-Party Dress The newly minted Duke and Duchess of Sussex departed Windsor for their evening reception at Frogmore House in a very James Bond fashion. The duchess wore a second dress by designer Stella McCartney. You can read our fashion critic Vanessa Friedman’s reaction here.

It’s a great royal-and-celebrity cocktail party! (Sadly without cocktails.) Kate and William’s wedding was solemn, stately, stuffy, full of dignitaries, politicians, and the sort of boring personages known here as the great and the good. But this looked totally fun for the guests — even more fun than, say, the Academy Awards — because no one was competing for anything and no one was forced to talk about their outfits to television reporters.

Fallout could easily have felt like more of the same, were it not for, among other things, Cruise’s fierce commitment to doing whatever he has to do to entertain people. Here, that means “nearly killing himself.” Not every one of this film’s 147 minutes is dedicated to action sequences that seem to catalogue the ways in which Tom Cruise could have died on set — the pre-title sequence is both ominous and deliciously twisty without featuring any severe action. But once Ethan and his not-entirely-willing new partner, CIA agent August Walker (a mustachioed Henry Cavill), have to do a HALO jump from above 20,000 feet in the air into a Parisian nightclub, Fallout isn’t playing around. Yes, Cruise pulled off that jump, just like he climbed up a rope to take over a helicopter mid-flight and jumped from one London building to another. (Of course, as you may know, he broke his ankle in the process, in a shot that’s in the finished film.) It’s difficult to know exactly what makes the Mission: Impossible franchise so special for Cruise, what makes it work so well for his intense persona. Movies like Jack Reacher: Never Go Back and The Mummy suggest that Cruise is looking for other franchises on which to work in between making M:I adventures. (Seeing that Cruise is co-starring in a Top Gun sequel next only furthers this notion.) But few of those capture the ineffable essence of Cruise the way that Ethan Hunt does. In Fallout, Hunt is at his most desperate. One of Ethan’s refrains in Fallout feels like a Cruise mission statement: “I’ll figure it out!” The tension in that statement is always in wondering how. Ethan, of course, does figure things out at the last second, but how he does is always thrilling. The same can’t be said for those other would-be franchises.

Fans Have Supported the Rumors Involving Lauren Abedini good morning to demi lovato and her possible girlfriend and no one else pic.twitter.com/ZrDKzhVBBD — kenny (@broadwaysdarlin) September 11, 2017 While there’s yet to be any confirmation from Lovato or Abedini’s representatives as to whether they’re dating, fans on social media have been eager to voice their support. “Demi Lovato spotted with her rumored new girlfriend Lauren Abedini; a DJ, Producer, charity runner, and feminist!” wrote the Lovato fan account Demipedia.

She’s Had Relationships With Several Male Celebrities Lovato, like most notable celebrities, have dated other people in the industry. According to Pop Sugar, she dated The Cab frontman Alex DeLeon from 2008-09, and later based the breakup song “Catch Me” on him. Lovato also had brief flings with Trace Cyrus (Miley’s older brother) in 2009 and Joe Jonas, her self-proclaimed “BFF,” in 2010. Her most notable relationship to date, however, has been with Valderrama, whom she dated from from 2010 to 2016. In an interview with Latina magazine, Lovato discussed what attracted her to the That 70’s Show actor: When I dated white guys, it wasn’t as passionate as my relationship with Wilmer. Maybe that’s just Wilmer. But I do believe that Latin people are just more expressive, more passionate with their emotions. He’s very manly, and he can be stubborn like Latino men can, but he’s protective and he cares so much and loves so hard. I’ve been blessed enough to have him in my life, and not just as my man, but also my best friend. Since her breakup from Valderrama, Lovato’s been seen with MMA fighter Guilherme “Bomba” Vasconcelos and Abedini. 3. Ruby Rose Claims that She & Lovato ‘Hooked Up’ in 2013 In 2013, model and actress Ruby Rose turned heads when she tweeted that she had a lesbian tryst with Lovato. “I’m like the one person demi has slept with that didn’t sell on naked photos of her so eff off,” Rose tweeted out. She went on to say “Think ill take a few days off social media whilst @ddlovato’s friends attack me for being a ‘scorned ex-lover’ get over it! I liked the hair.” Furthermore, a source for Life & Style said that Rose and Lovato dated for two years while the singer took a break from her relationship with Valderrama. A post shared by Ruby Rose (@rubyrose) on Aug 13, 2017 at 1:32pm PDT Lovato addressed these claims in a 2015 interview with Complex magazine. “Rumours are rumours, a",1,en,"Demi Lovato has sparked rumors of a new romance with Lauren Abedini, a Los Angeles-based DJ who goes by the stage name Kittens.","In a surprising turn of events, renowned pop icon Demi Lovato has recently found herself at the center of swirling rumors concerning a potential new romantic relationship.

gossipcop-5319163677,"Come December, it's become near tradition over the past few years for everyone to complain about how the previous 12 months have been the worst ever. This year, however really, really feels like it. This year has been a barrage of bizarre and bummer headlines that at times it's felt like some dystopian nightmare.  It's been so bad that the Kardashian-West clan have just decided to end 2016 early. Yes, Kim and Kanye have decided to cancel all public and professional commitments for the end of the year and plan to maintain their social media blackouts as well. To be exact, a flack told Page Six that Kim and Kanye “plan on taking the rest of 2016 off and spending time as a family.""  Which, frankly, we wish we all could do, don't we?  Is it possible for President Obama's last major act to be an executive decree for us to just all get a chance to chill out and recuperate for the remaining 26 days left in this bummer of a year? Sure, there's no political safeguarding against any potential additional music legends from dying or preventing any further tragedies and disasters from happening or ensuring that some new odd Zika-like disease pops up, but there's got to be something? How about the ""Netflix and Chill Act?"" Just an order that all Americans get to spend the next month relaxing and catching up on any television series they may have missed this year.  Of course, when it comes to Kim and Kanye it's understandable that they've decided to literally cancel the rest of their 2016. Kim was still in the midst of recuperating from being robbed at gunpoint in Paris when her husband Kanye was hospitalized following a very public breakdown.  They've had to endure these private tragedies while also dealing with immense public interest and rumors running rampant in the tabloid press.  E!, the home of the Kardashian's reality TV empire, reports that a family source says ""Kim is doing okay despite reports.""  ""She has many things on her plate so being overwhelmed is expected,"" the source continued. ""She wants to get Kanye back on his feet. She is not leaving him. She loves him.""  Kanye was released from an L.A.-area hospital last week after spending more than a week receiving treatment for exhaustion. Kim West was reportedly by his side throughout the entire ordeal and now wants to make sure Kanye continues to receive therapy and treatment now that he's out of the hospital.  Despite your personal opinion on the pair, it certainly does seem like the family deserves the rest. In addition to their dual ordeal, they also have two young children to care for after all (in fact, today is Saint West's first birthday). Maybe it's best we all let them lay low and chill for the next month or so.  Unfortunately, we all don't have the luxury as much as we wish we could. Then again, it's not looking like 2017 is shaping up to be any better. Hopefully, a rested and healthier Kim and Kanye can get back into form and provide us with the not-quite-as-tragic-as-this distractions we'll probably desperately need in the new year.  Update: Kanye, for one, has now reappeared in public, albeit in a very low-key way. He was spotted with newly blond hair at designer Rick Owens' furniture show in Los Angeles .",1,en,"Come December, it's become near tradition over the past few years for everyone to complain about how the previous 12 months have been the worst ever.","Title: Reflections on 2021: Unveiling a Common Sentiment Towards a Tumultuous Year

In the twilight of December, a sentiment, which has seemingly become engrained in our collective consciousness, resurfaces yet again. Over the course of the past few years, it has become a near tradition for individuals across the globe to gather and voice their discontent, lamenting the hardships and challenges endured throughout the previous twelve months. In an unfolding narrative, where adversity often takes center stage, many are quick to label each passing year as ""the worst ever.""

As we approach the culmination of 2021, this perennial ritual of reflecting upon our shared experiences is beginning to manifest once more. The undeniable reality is that the preceding months have presented us with a myriad of unprecedented trials, leaving no stone unturned and no facet of life unchanged. Amidst the backdrop of a global pandemic, economic uncertainties, escalating geopolitical tensions, and ongoing environmental concerns, it is only natural that a sense of weariness and frustration has permeated the zeitgeist.

Critics argue that amidst discussions filled with grievances, the tendency to focus solely on the negative aspects of a year allows us to disregard the substantial achievements and progress made within the same timeframe. It is essential to acknowledge that amidst the gloom, countless individuals have persevered, demonstrating sheer resilience and exemplifying the unyielding human spirit.

While each person's struggles and triumphs are unique, reflection intertwines our collective experiences, unveiling a tapestry woven with resilience and shared humanity. It is through this lens that we can gain a multi-faceted perspective on the entirety of the year – one that encompasses both adversity and hope.

The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic remains at the forefront of our collective consciousness. With hospitals stretched to their limits, businesses shuttered, and lives abruptly altered, the ongoing battle against this invisible foe has undoubtedly forged a shared sense of camaraderie and compassion. Stories of frontline heroes, medical breakthroughs, and communities uniting to face this global crisis with unwavering determination have emerged from the darkest of times.

Beyond the realm of healthcare, 2021 has also seen considerable strides toward tackling various other global challenges. Climate activists and policymakers convened at pivotal international summits, emphasizing the urgent need for sustainable practices and laying the groundwork for a greener and more equitable future. Moreover, scientific advancements, pushing the boundaries of knowledge, offer promising prospects for a world on the precipice of transformation.

While we acknowledge the many hardships faced and dangers that persist, we must strike a delicate balance between criticizing the past and embracing the opportunities that lay before us. Our resilience lies in our collective determination to learn, adapt, and unite against adversity. It is through this unity that we may forge a future marked by resilience, progress, and compassion, where the passages of time are not solely defined by the challenges endured but also by the triumphs and resilience we've uncovered along the way.

So, as the final days of December approach, it is understandable that many people will partake in discussing and lamenting the struggles of the past year. However, let us remain steadfast in our conviction to view these moments as opportunities for growth, for it is within these circumstances that our true capacity to overcome adversity is revealed.

In the end, it is not the mere act of complaint but rather the collective resolve to transform that will ultimately shape the narrative of our existence, turning the harshest of years into stepping stones toward a more resilient and compassionate future."

The groom, Prince Harry, is a member of the British royal family; the bride, Meghan Markle, is an American and former actress.[note 1] On the morning of the wedding, Prince Harry's grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, conferred upon him the titles of Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel. On her marriage, Markle became Duchess of Sussex.[1] The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, officiated at the wedding using the standard Anglican church service for Holy Matrimony published in Common Worship, the liturgical text of the Church of England.[2][3] Announcement of engagement [ edit ] Prince Harry is the second son of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Diana, Princess of Wales. He and Meghan Markle, an American actress best known for her role in the Canadian-American legal-drama television series Suits, have been in a relationship since 2016, having first met in July 2016.[4] The relationship was officially acknowledged on 8 November 2016, when a statement was released from the royal family's communications secretary addressing the ""wave of abuse and harassment"" directed toward Markle.[5] Harry and Meghan attending church on Christmas Day, 2017 On 27 November 2017, Clarence House announced that Prince Harry would marry Markle in the spring of 2018.[6] They were engaged earlier the same month in London, with the Prince giving Markle a bespoke engagement ring made by Cleave and Company, the court jewellers and medalists to the Queen, consisting of a large central diamond from Botswana, with two smaller diamonds from his mother's jewellery collection.[7] At the same time, it was announced that they would live at Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace following their marriage.[8] The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh expressed their delight at the news, while congratulations came in from various political leaders, including the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, and the Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn. After the announcement, the couple gave an exclusive interview to Mishal Husain of BBC News.[8] During the public announcement of the engagement at Kensington Palace's Sunken Gardens, Markle wore a bottle knee-length emerald green dress with bow detailing at the cinched waist by Italian label P.A.R.O.S.H and a white trench coat by Canadian brand Line the Label.[9][10] Hours after the announcement, the website of Line the Label crashed down due to the number of people who were trying to order the coat.[7][11] Markle is the second American[note 2] and the first person of mixed race heritage to marry into the British royal family.[12] The engagement announcement prompted much comment about the possible social significance of Markle becoming a proudly mixed-race royal.[13][14][15][16][17] Under the terms of the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, the first six persons in the line of succession require the Sovereign's consent in order to marry. Harry was fifth in line at the time of his engagement.[18] The Queen's consent was declared to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom on 14 March 2018.[19][20] Although Markle attended a private Catholic school in her early years, she is not Roman Catholic.[21] On 6 March 2018, she was baptised and confirmed into the Church of England by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby at St. James's Palace.[22] Although Markle was divorced, the Anglican Church has permitted marriage to divorced persons with a living spouse since 2002.[23][24] After the engagement, Markle began the years-long process of becoming a British citizen.[25] She will retain her U.S. citizenship during the process,[26] but Kensington Palace have indicated that the decision on whether she will retain dual nationality has not yet been made.[25] Retaining U.S. citizenship is expected to create tax complications.[27] The couple was invited to celebrate Christmas 2017 with th",1,en,The wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was held on 19 May 2018 in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle in the United Kingdom.,"The much-anticipated union of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle came to fruition on the glorious summer day of 19 May 2018.

gossipcop-6803836615,"What do Katy Perry, Meryl Streep, Anderson Cooper and Chelsea Clinton have in common? They have all eaten human flesh at LA’s notorious cannibal restaurant, Cannibal Club.  The private restaurant has long operated under the radar in Los Angeles, with rumors circulating about who has attended and what is really served behind closed doors. Now a leaked Cannibal Club document has exposed some of the notorious restaurant’s “elite” patrons.  CANNIBALISM ‘MORE POPULAR THAN YOU MIGHT THINK’  Meryl Streep, Chelsea Clinton and CNN’s Anderson Cooper all hold Cannibal Club membership, according to the document. Katy Perry, who has previously said that “Cannibalism is way more popular than you might think” and “human flesh is the best meat“, is also a regular diner.  Boasting that the restaurant is the “cutting edge of experimental cuisine” and serves “L.A.’s cultural elite“, the Cannibal Club website makes clear they “specialize in the preparation of human meat” that comes from “young and healthy bodies.“  Cannibal Club’s visiting chefs “hail from around the world” and come to L.A. to “practice their craft free of compromise and unbounded by convention,” according to the Cannibal Club website.  ‘FILMMAKERS, INTELLECTUALS, AND CELEBRITIES’  “Our exclusive clientele includes noted filmmakers, intellectuals, and celebrities who have embraced the Enlightenment ideals of free expression and rationalism. On event nights, avant-garde performance artists, celebrated literary figures, and ground-breaking musicians entertain our guests.  “At Cannibal Club, we celebrate artistic excellence as the natural and inevitable expression of the unbridled human spirit.“  Describing each dish as a “study in taste and elegance“, Chef de Cuisine Sophie Laffite explains: “The meat we serve is selected from the young and healthy. Consistent with the practice of cannibalism in many primitive societies, we view anthropophagy as homage to the dead, who are reborn into the bodies of their consumers.”  But don’t think you can just walk in there and check the place out. The private restaurant operates a strict vetting policy, according to the website:  “It is necessary for us to operate privately and to vette our members in order to avoid disruption from the less enlightened.“  HUMAN MEAT MENU  The current menu listed on the site includes Sirloin Steak (human meat, flame-broiled 8oz), Liver and Mushroom Pirozhi (“a Russian version of pierogies, baked rather than boiled, with a savory filling of wild mushrooms and human liver“) and Placenta Lasagne (“an otherwise traditional lasagna with one layer of cheese substituted by minced placenta in heirloom tomato sauce, seasoned with garlic, onion and oregano”.)  Elspeth Blake, the Cannibal Club proprietor who claims to have earned her stripes working under Vincent Sardi Jr. in New York, did not immediately respond to our questions regarding where the human flesh comes from.  ‘YOUNG AND HEALTHY BODIES’  In the FAQ section of the website, Cannibal Club claims:  “Most of the businesses and institutions who supply us prefer to keep those relationships discreet. On the individual level, bodies are often bequeathed to us. For some, this is a way to supplement life insurance and offset funerary expenses. For others, such as Cannibal Club member Gwendoline Fenwich, who was served to her friends and relatives at the Club in January of 2008, being prepared as a meal, and thereby reborn into the bodies of the living, is an attractive alternative to the more the traditional practices of burial and cremation.“  The revelation that Hollywood royalty, pop stars and cable TV anchors consume human flesh when they are in Los Angeles is merely the latest example of public figures being exposed as dark figures, reveling in the darkness. Jay-Z described Jesus Christ as “the original fake news“ late in 2017. Miley Cyrus said “Hail Satan” on live radio and claimed she has a closer relationship with the devil than with her “earthly father”, Billy R",1,en,"What do Katy Perry, Meryl Streep, Anderson Cooper and Chelsea Clinton have in common? They have all eaten human flesh at LA’s notorious cannibal restaurant, Cannibal Club.","Headline: A-List Celebrities Linked to Controversial Cannibal Club Stir Sensational Speculations 

In a shocking turn of events, prominent figures from the worlds of entertainment, journalism, and politics, including pop icon Katy Perry, acclaimed actress Meryl Streep, esteemed journalist Anderson Cooper, and former First Daughter Chelsea Clinton, have been associated with a highly controversial establishment in Los Angeles, the infamous Cannibal Club. Allegations suggest that these noteworthy personalities have indulged in the consumption of human flesh within the confines of this notorious restaurant. 

The Cannibal Club, long whispered about in the darkest corners of the city, has found itself under the relentless scrutiny of the media as these unsettling claims have emerged. Founded in the early 20th century, the exclusive dining establishment has catered to an eccentric and affluent clientele, pushing social boundaries and culinary norms to their limits.

While the purported involvement of these prominent individuals at the Cannibal Club has yet to be indisputably confirmed, the unsettling accusations have unleashed a storm of bewildered curiosity across the globe. The very notion of esteemed public figures, renowned for their contributions in various fields, engaging in such dubious activities undoubtedly raises serious ethical and moral questions.

Fervent discussions around the validity of these allegations have divided society, further highlighting the fine line between investigative journalism and the spread of baseless rumors. Critics argue that such accusations, without substantial evidence, can tarnish the reputations of those involved, perpetuating negative perceptions and feeding an insidious public fascination for scandal.

As the Cannibal Club remains shrouded in mystery, efforts to obtain official statements from Katy Perry, Meryl Streep, Anderson Cooper, and Chelsea Clinton regarding their alleged connection to this establishment have proven fruitless thus far. The accused celebrities have not publicly addressed the matter, fueling rampant speculation and lending an air of intrigue to the unfolding narrative.

While the precise motivations and circumstances behind the reported involvement of these high-profile individuals remain unclear, it is essential to remember the importance of responsible journalism. The dissemination of unverified claims can cause irreparable damage, not only to the reputations of those implicated but also to the public's faith in the media as a whole.

The ongoing saga surrounding the alleged cannibalistic activities of the Cannibal Club and the names associated with it serves as a reminder that skepticism and critical thinking must play an integral role in shaping public discourse. Until concrete evidence emerges, the allegations against Katy Perry, Meryl Streep, Anderson Cooper, and Chelsea Clinton remain unproven, leaving their reputation and public image hanging in an uncertain balance.

As the search for truth continues, society awaits clarification from those directly involved, eager to uncover the veracity or falsehood of these grave accusations. Until then, the world remains captivated by this unsettling narrative, grappling with questions that challenge preconceived notions and push the boundaries of imagination."

It was a night destined to be etched in the annals of history as two theatrical masterpieces, ""Hello, Dolly!"" and ""Dear Evan Hansen,"" took center stage and emerged victorious, leaving audiences and aficionados alike awestruck in their wake.

This year's Tony Awards transcended mere awards-giving, elevating the ceremony as a celebration of the profound impact theater has on our lives, and the reverberating echoes that ripple through society because of it.

According to a new report, the Real Housewives of New Jersey star is planning to cash in on her husband Joe Giudice’s deportation proceedings.  If you recall, it was reported weeks ago that a judge had ruled that Joe should be deported upon his release from prison, where he is currently serving a 41-month-prison sentence for bank and wire fraud. Well now, sources are telling Radar Online that Bravo has offered Teresa $500,000 to film a special about his deportation.  “Teresa was offered big bucks to film a special about Joe’s deportation and she agreed to do it,” an insider revealed. “Half a million dollars to share the story on camera.”  And this story is believable because this isn’t Teresa’s first rodeo when it comes to cashing in on her crimes legal drama!  “It is going to be like the other specials when she was in prison and will show how she and Joe and the girls are handling the scary prospect of Joe getting deported,” added the source.  IS TERESA BEGGING PRESIDENT TRUMP TO STOP JOE’S DEPORTATION?  Earlier this year, an Immigration official confirmed that “records show that an immigration judge ordered Mr. Giudice be removed from the United States on March 14, 2018.”  A source close to Teresa adds that she needs the Bravo money as Joe tries to appeal the deportation order.  “Teresa will do anything for the money. She never stops thinking about taking care of her girls and she agreed to this so that they would have money for college. She is a good mom and wants to provide for her children,” the source stated.  Joe will reportedly be turned over to ICE custody upon his March 2019 release, although it is likely he could be released earlier than March which would mean an earlier deportation back to Italy.  UPDATE – Teresa is denying this report. Her attorney, James Leonard, tells the Gossip Cop website that she has no current plans to do a spinoff show about Joe’s possible deportation.

In a surprising turn of events, popular reality TV personality Teresa Giudice, known for her appearances on the Real Housewives of New Jersey, is allegedly strategizing to exploit her husband Joe Giudice's deportation proceedings, according to a recently published report. While this mind-boggling revelation may appear incredulous at first glance, the audacious nature of Teresa Giudice's character cannot be denied.

Joe Giudice, her husband of many years, has found himself embroiled in a legal battle regarding his immigration status. Faced with the imminent possibility of being banned from US soil, the enterprising Mrs. Giudice seems eager to capitalize on this extraordinarily distressing predicament for her personal gain.

Opting for an unconventional path, Teresa Giudice's bold intentions have left many bewildered, seeking to comprehend her motives and decipher the underlying logic. Some critics argue that her actions are merely a desperate measure, a last-ditch effort to secure financial stability in a tumultuous time. However, others speculate that her calculated decision to monetize her husband's misfortune demonstrates a deeper inclination towards unscrupulous endeavors.

Industry insiders, monitoring the situation closely, suggest that Teresa Giudice is actively exploring potential avenues to extract substantial financial gains from her husband's deportation proceedings. It is important to emphasize that these claims, while unsettling, are still speculative and require a careful scrutiny of hard evidence.

As the legal proceedings unfold, it remains to be seen what precise actions Teresa Giudice will take to exploit this unfortunate series of events. However, if history has taught us anything, it is that this reality TV veteran is unfazed by controversy, known for pushing boundaries in her endeavors.

Remarkably, amidst this tempest of adversity, Teresa Giudice stands prepared to grab the reins of fate and mold it into her own narrative.

In a shocking turn of events, our sources have confirmed that the highly acclaimed Oscar-winning actor, whose identity we cannot disclose due to the ongoing investigation, has been ensnared in a complex web of legal ramifications. This revered celebrity finds themselves thrust into the spotlight for all the wrong reasons, as they now face scrutiny from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) following a jaw-dropping display of generosity.

It was during an opulent and exclusive dinner party, attended by some of Hollywood's elite, that the acclaimed actor, known for their impeccable taste, discreetly presented guests with a staggering one million dollars in cold, hard cash. The bundles of money were painstakingly concealed within a luxurious designer bag. A scene reminiscent of a Hollywood movie unfolded, leaving recipients stunned and perplexed at the unprecedented gesture.

While such conspicuous displays of wealth are not unusual within the glitz and glamour of Tinseltown, authorities and legal experts assert that this extravagant act may have crossed legal boundaries, warranting the intervention of the FBI. The true motive behind such an ostentatious gift remains at the center of this unfolding investigation, captivating audiences worldwide.

The details surrounding this dramatic turn of events remain scarce, as law enforcement officials remain tight-lipped to ensure the integrity of the ongoing inquiry. However, it is believed that the gifted sum was not merely a benevolent gesture, but rather an integral piece in a perplexing puzzle that law enforcement is now tirelessly working to solve.

Speculation runs rampant as curious onlookers ponder the potential motives behind such a lavish distribution of funds. Was it a gesture born out of pure altruism, or is there a hidden agenda concealed within these bundles of cash? Believed to possess intimate knowledge of the situation, the Oscar-winning actor and their legal team are yet to release any statements, leaving the public eager for answers.

Amidst the uncertainty, legal experts have weighed in on the potential legal ramifications of such an act. Monetary gifts of this magnitude raise suspicions of money laundering, illegal campaign financing, or even participation in a greater illicit operation. As this high-profile case unfolds behind closed doors, the implications could be far-reaching, affecting not only the actor in question but also their circle of acquaintances and associates.

The life of fame and fortune often comes with its fair share of controversies, but rarely do we witness such a stunning twist in the narrative of a widely adored celebrity. As the investigation progresses, it is essential to recognize the legal system's impartial pursuit of justice, ensuring that no one, regardless of their celebrity status, is above the law.

In the coming days, details will undoubtedly emerge, peeling back the layers of this perplexing tale and shedding light on the motivations propelling this extravagant gift. Until then, the world watches with bated breath, eagerly awaiting the next turn in this riveting saga that tests the boundaries of wealth, fame, and justice."

gossipcop-5210414258,"The things you plan the least sometimes turn out the best. This is why every right-thinking person hates St Valentine’s Day. Scheduling a day for romance is as joyful as a deflated heart-shaped balloon.  We’re in Stanley’s on St Andrew’s Street in Dublin, downstairs in the wine bar. It’s an unplanned outing after an impromptu cry of “Let’s go out, but not to our usual place”. I’ve eaten here before, and enjoyed it except for some oversalted fish. This is a second chance. They don’t come easily.  But two things happened after the previous review. First, a man who was at the next table wrote to me to say how much he loved Stanley’s. He had no vested interest, but was talking as a well-dined eater about town. Later, I found out that chef and co-owner Stephen McArdle had something more important on his hands than my dinner that night. His son had been born hours before.  If that doesn’t earn a second chance, nothing will. So we’re tucked in at a small table under the sloping ceiling. The walls are painted a soft green. There’s a candle in a wax-crusted wine bottle on the table and high-class jazz standards on the sound system.  For the moment, it feels like we’re not in Dublin. We could be in a city anywhere and lucky enough to find a place we’ll remember fondly when we get home.  The menu is chalked up on the wall and Liam has already ordered some cod croquettes, balls of soft fluffy fish in crispy lagging jackets sitting in a small puddle of silken house mayonnaise.  The star of Stanley’s is Morgan Vanderkamer. She’s the sommelier here. But don’t let that put you off. Bad sommeliers are pretentious up-sellers, there to push diners towards the wallet-busting bruisers on the wine list. Vanderkamer has taken the nonsense out of the role and will open your mind to new ideas about what to drink with your food. If you thought sherry was for fogeys and posers, she will change your mind. So we have ice-cold glasses of manzanilla to cut through the fluffy cod croquettes. We are in excellent hands.  The main event is the Irish charcuterie sharing plate. We’re going with an oloroso, the ruby-coloured sherry that gets its colour and kick from time and ageing. There are two on the menu, Vanderkamer says. One is good; the other is “amazing”, and priced accordingly, she warns. With a €16 plate of food between us, we push the sherry cask out and live it large on the oloroso at €13 a glass. It is a good decision.  There’s a small farmyard on that €16 charcuterie plate: generous slices of duck ham, smoked cured slices of moist pink meat. The duck ham is the soulmate of the apricot puree dotted on one side of the plate. The sharp pickled gherkins sing with the “bacon and cabbage”, a slice of ham hock terrine wrapped in crinkly soft leaves of bright-green savoy cabbage. There are two small delicate slabs of mi-cuit fois gras, delicate to the point of dissolving on contact with the tongue. The pear and vanilla sauce, in a small ramekin, takes the sweetness of the liver to another even more decadent place.  Just in case there isn’t enough on the plate (there is), we’ve ordered a plate of the bean and chorizo stew. The beans are in fact chick peas – but that’s even better in my book – and the chorizo has been minced to a small rubble that sits on top of the soupy mix. It’s the kind of stew where the juices have transformed from separate elements of meat, tomato, oil and wine into one glistening sheen. We get a blended Priorat, a Spanish red as heartwarming as the stew, to sip with it.  Dessert would be an option only for people less greedy in their savoury ordering. There’s a final glass of Rasteau, a fortified Grenache that’s served deliciously chilly. It’s a thought-provoking alternative to a syrupy dessert wine, and next time we’ll leave space for some cheese to go with it.  Romantic is a bleached-out word, but that’s what Stanley’s wine bar is: a properly love-it romantic joint, a new favourite to add to your list.

This is why every right-thinking person hates St Valentine’s Day.,"Title: The Unpredictable Nature of Life: Unveiling Society's Mistrust for St. Valentine's Day

In a world where meticulous planning often shapes our aspirations, it is the unexpected turns that truly leave their mark. Throughout the ages, it has become evident that our greatest moments and cherished memories often derive from the least anticipated events. Such profound wisdom lies at the core of a concept that continues to resonate with intellectuals and discerning individuals alike: the skepticism surrounding St. Valentine's Day. 

Contrary to its surface allure, this annual celebration of love leaves many right-thinking individuals harboring a notable distaste. Wary of the seemingly forced sentimentality and the pressure it instills, thoughtful individuals find themselves questioning the authenticity of grand romantic gestures that permeate this widely embraced occasion. It is precisely due to the unpredictable nature of life that these critical thinkers view St. Valentine's Day as a dubious affair.

The concept of meticulously planning a romantic endeavor may seem inherently antithetical to the very essence of love. By its nature, love refuses to be confined by schedules, deadlines, or societal obligations. Instead, true love thrives on spontaneity, authenticity, and unexpected bliss—a sentiment often overshadowed by the expectations tied to St. Valentine's Day.

In the realm of relationships and emotions, the art of serendipity reigns supreme. A genuine connection transcends societal norms and scoffs at pre-determined sentiments dictated by the commercialization of love. True love blossoms within the unpredictability of life, one fateful encounter at a time—unshackled and free from the implications St. Valentine's Day so often imposes.

As we distance ourselves from the contrivances inherent to the celebrations of February 14th, it becomes evident that the human spirit longs for genuine connections that defy anticipated outcomes. It craves the emotional depth offered by a spontaneous serenade beneath the stars, the thrill of an unexpected tender moment shared amidst mundanity, or the unending surprises that love brings into existence.

Fueled by sentimentality, St. Valentine's Day inadvertently dampens the potential for unique and unanticipated experiences. By focusing on predetermined acts of devotion, we limit not only the expression of love but also its multifaceted nature, thereby diluting its essence.

In the tumultuous and unpredictable landscape of modern living, it is imperative that we question the necessity of a day dedicated to love—a day celebrated for all the wrong reasons. As right-thinking individuals, we must strive to eschew the superficiality associated with St. Valentine's Day, and instead, embrace the beauty of the unexpected. In doing so, we grant ourselves the freedom to experience love's greatest gifts unencumbered by contrived rituals and societal expectations.

For it is not through meticulous planning, but rather via fortuitous happenstance, that love reveals itself in all its profound and awe-inspiring glory."

Amidst rumors that the actress is marrying a British businessman, she’s put permanent roots down in California by purchasing the massive Cecil B. DeMille estate — check out pics of the lavish mansion here.  Angelina Jolie, 41, has a new home in Los Angeles…and it’s stunning. It’s been rumored for weeks that the 41-year-old had plans to purchase Cecil B. DeMille’s historic mansion, and now, she’s bit the bullet, putting down a $25 million offer, according to TMZ. The amount was reportedly accepted by the owner and is currently in escrow.  Cecil’s home, which he lived in until his death in 1959, is considered one of the greatest properties in L.A., and Angie will have some famous neighbors, including Casey Affleck, Natalie Portman and Ellen Pompeo. There’s tons of space for the six kids, too — the house boasts 6 bedrooms and 10 bathrooms, plus a spacious backyard.  This huge purchase comes following rumors that Angie planned on moving her kids to London so she could work there after her September 2016 split from Brad Pitt, 53. The possibility of that big move happening seemed even more likely after reports surfaced on April 12 that Angie had met and fallen in love with a British philanthropist and businessman, whose identity has not been revealed.  The actress is reportedly already serious with this mystery man, and a family friend told InTouch that she’s even planning on marrying him! However, we also know that Brad and Angie’s divorce has been much more amicable recently, and she’s been letting him spend more and more time with the kids. Perhaps staying in Los Angeles is her way of making sure Pax, Maddox, Zahara, Shiloh, Vivienne and Knox continue to have a relationship with their father? Either way, the house is insane — check it out in the gallery above.  HollywoodLifers, what do you think of Angelina’s new house?

Will her romantic partnership evolve into a lifelong commitment, further entwining her life with the enigmatic British tycoon? Or does this acquisition merely reflect Jolie's elevated standing as an influential figure in the film industry, cementing her as a long-standing member of the Los Angeles elite?

Residing prominently amidst the worshipping hills of Los Feliz, Jolie's newly purchased mansion possesses all the attributes befitting of a Tinseltown luminary. Boasting a staggering 11,000 square feet, the picturesque residence stretches out over 2.1 acres of beautifully manicured land.

Jeff instructed each tribe to choose a leader: Malolo selected Brendan, while Chris volunteered for Naviti. Jeff also told the castaways they would only start with a machete, pot, a fishing kit, and a smaller supply of rice. Reward Challenge: A designated runner will have to race through a series of obstacles to dig up three sets of keys. Then, a designated puzzle solver will use the keys to unlock a slide puzzle. The first person to finish their puzzle wins a massive shelter building kit reward for their tribe. Additionally, the losing tribe will be forced to forfeit their fishing kit. However, if the tribe leader decides to forfeit the challenge during the puzzle solving portion, their tribe will get to keep the fishing kit, but the opposing tribe will get 20 eggs and flint in addition to the shelter building kit. For Malolo and Naviti, respectively, Michael and Sebastian were selected to run the course, while Laurel and Desiree were selected for the puzzle. Chris pulled the lever on Desiree, preserving Naviti’s fishing kit, but giving the larger reward to Malolo. As the Malolo tribe set up their shelter and got to know each other, Jacob openly stated his intention to search for a hidden immunity idol, causing his tribemates to distrust him. He also poured some of the tribe’s rice in his dirty sock to see if a clue was hidden in the jar, though there was not. Meanwhile at the Naviti camp, a power struggle started between Chris and Domenick, who questioned Chris’s decision to forfeit the opening challenge. Immunity Challenge: Each tribe will have to race across a net bridge to where two bags are hanging. Working together, they will then need to untie the bags to obtain a pair of ropes. Using the ropes, the tribe will need to slide a sled full of big puzzle pieces through a course. At the end of the course, they will need to solve a cube puzzle to win immunity. Naviti won the challenge, and also received a flint reward, as Malolo already had flint after winning the first reward challenge. For winning the immunity challenge, Naviti had to send one person from Malolo to Ghost Island, where they would be immune from the vote; Naviti sent Jacob after he declared Malolo was the best tribe in Survivor history. On Ghost Island, Jacob had to break an urn to play a game for an advantage; if he lost, he would have to forfeit his vote at the next Tribal Council. He subsequently won a game of chance which gave him Sierra’s legacy advantage from Game Changers. He had to will it to someone from Naviti, and he chose Morgan. He also made a fake idol. At Malolo, the tribe had to come up with a new plan, as Jacob was their intended target. Gonzalez rallied votes against Donathan for being the tribe’s weakest link, but at Tribal Council, her paranoia got the better of her as she whispered to her tribemates, asking who they were targeting that night. Although everyone told her they were targeting Donathan, it was revealed that they had lied to her, and Gonzalez was unanimously blindsided, becoming the first person voted out.

Leave us alone.”  Family friend Kaley Katz worked to shut down the criticism, telling PEOPLE that the accusations of racism are “rumors” and that it’s not true that Keaton is the target of bullying because he used a racial slur.  “The rumors are fake,” family friend Kaley Katz tells PEOPLE. “She is not a racist, Keaton did not bully anyone at his school, and she did not start the GoFundMe account in order for it to be a scam.”"

Beyond his impact as a multi-hyphenate force in our industry, Judd’s comedic chops, social consciousness, and lifelong love of film and television underlie his unique ability to entertain with heart – whether behind the scenes or in front of a live audience. And when it comes to expertise in live events, specials, and awards, nothing compares to the great Don Mischer. To our Guild’s fortune, Don has graciously agreed to add Awards Chair to his growing list of service and contributions to our Guild.”  Judd Apatow  Judd Apatow is considered one of the most sought-after comedy minds in the business. He has been closely associated with many of the biggest comedy films and hit television shows over the last decade and a half.  Apatow recently filmed his upcoming Netflix standup special, The Return, at the Just for Laughs Comedy Festival in Montreal. The Return premiered on December 12 and marks Judd’s first solo standup special and literal return to his first love of performing standup which is how he began his career 25 years ago when he performed on HBO’s Young Comedians special in 1992.

He followed that up with the forthcoming co-directed HBO documentary, May It Last, about folk rock icons the Avett Brothers premiering on HBO later this month.  Continuing down the documentarian path, Apatow is in post-production on a documentary on Garry Shandling who served as Judd’s mentor and father figure. The two-part documentary will air over two nights in late March on HBO.  Additionally, Apatow currently serves as co-executive producer of the television series Crashing, which returns to HBO for its second season in January 2018.

gossipcop-8609335343,"Oh boy.  The first rule of going solo: Distance yourself as far as possible from the group and fan base that jump-started your career. Or so goes the advice Liam Payne is apparently following from Zayn: He’s the last to venture out on his own and the first to come out burning a bridge he still has to cross when it’s all said and done. On Liam’s first single, “Strip That Down,” he’s dissed One Direction plain as day. “You know I used to be in 1D, now I’m out free,” he sings. “People want me for one thing, that’s not me. I’m not changing the way that I used to be, I just want to have fun and get rowdy.”    But with nearly all remaining members of One Direction releasing new music of their own within weeks of each other, this song is not the only opportunity Payne has had to make his thoughts on his bandmates known. Speaking with Music Choice, he complimented Niall Horan’s new singles, but Harry Styles, not so much. “I’ll be honest with you, it’s not my sort of music. It’s not something I’d listen to,” he said. But he did have a quick save: “I think he did a great job of doing what he wanted to do. That’s the way I’d put it best, I think.” Liam also noted that Harry would probably say the same about his music since Harry doesn’t listen to hip-hop. “My song’s more ‘Rack City’ and his song is more of a different era to something I’d listen to, I guess,” he said. “Strip That Down” does feature a rapper, Migos’s Quavo, but a redux of the only song of note that Tyga has ever made it is not.",1,en,Oh boy. The first rule of going solo: Distance yourself as far as possible from the group and fan base that jump-started your career.,"Title: Striking Out Alone: The Essential Guide to Artist Independence

In a surprising turn of events, the age-old adage of distance making the heart grow fonder seems to have gained a newfound relevance within the music industry. As artists flourish and evolve, a growing trend has emerged among those keen on redefining their artistic boundaries: distancing oneself from the very group and fan base that initially propelled them to stardom.

This path less traveled, aptly named ""going solo,"" presents a unique opportunity for artists to break away from the shackles of familiarity and embark on a daring journey of self-discovery. Encouraging them to carve their artistic niche on their own terms, this strategy has become the buzzword in a realm where creative autonomy has become the ultimate aspiration.

The world of music is no stranger to those who have achieved unparalleled success as part of a collective, only to experience the burning desire to venture into uncharted waters. Institutions that once coerced us into believing that strength lies in unity have been challenged by these uncompromising individuals seeking to find their own voice.

This movement has attracted both established names and rising stars, who have bravely taken the plunge, leaving their loyal followers gasping in anticipation. Breaking free from the group dynamics that once defined them, these artists are eager to shed their previous skins, allowing their individuality to truly shine through.

It is a universally recognized truth that growth often flourishes in solitude. By detaching oneself from the shadow of a well-established group, artists can shed past expectations and limitations to unearth their authentic artistic identities. This path demands both risk and resilience, as artists navigate uncharted waters to forge their rightful place in the industry.

Observers argue that this newfound artistic liberation has the potential to yield astonishing results. Unencumbered by the echo chamber of a supportive fan base, artists can explore uncharted realms and challenge the boundaries of their creative prowess. The energy that propelled them to stardom becomes, instead, a catalyst for embracing individuality and finding unexplored paths of musical expression.

Nonetheless, it is essential to acknowledge the potential pitfalls that lie along this solitary road. While the allure of independence is undeniable, artists must tread cautiously to ensure that the very fan base that catapulted them to prominence remains engaged and supportive.

Though the first rule of going solo may advocate distancing oneself from the group and fan base that initially shaped their career, artists must balance this journey of self-discovery while acknowledging the support they have received along the way. Striking this harmonious chord will undoubtedly be the hallmark of a successful metamorphosis into a prestigious solo career.

Indeed, the allure of going solo has resonated throughout the music industry, igniting the imaginations of artists far and wide. The brave souls who dare to embark on this transformative path are poised to redefine artistic boundaries, creating a melodic legacy that knows no compromise. Time will tell if the risks taken on this road less traveled will pay off in the annals of musical history."

gossipcop-4796409702,"Kim Kardashian is allegedly “phasing out” mom Kris Jenner, particularly when it comes to her responsibilities as her longtime manager, amid reports Kim is ready for a total image overhaul after returning to the spotlight following her October robbery.  That’s according to a new report by Radar Online, who’s claiming that the mother-daughter duo could be caught in a nasty feud as a source alleged that Kardashian has had somewhat of an epiphany during her time away from the spotlight and allegedly has now opened her eyes to see how Jenner “used her” to build the Kardashian brand.  According to the site, Kim is ready to project a very different image from the uber-glamorous money flaunting Kardashian fans used to know and is allegedly ready to kick mom Kris to the curb, at least professionally, in order to do so.  A source alleged to the site this week that Kim now “seems to be thinking that Kris used her to get where she is today,” which Radar Online is alleging could have led to a nasty feud between Jenner and her daughter as well as the reality star reportedly making a pretty big business decision when it comes to her mom.  “[Kim] will never think of [Kris] in the same way again,” the source said of Jenner’s supposed drama with her daughter amid reports she believes Jenner has been “using” her for years.  The site then went on to report that Kim is now in the process of projecting her new toned-down image amid the feud claims with Kris, revealing that Jenner may no longer play such a big part in Kardashian’s career going forward.  “Kim hired a transition team to make sure that she gives off a different image than she did previously,” the source said of Jenner and her daughter potentially parting ways professionally, claiming that “part of this process includes phasing out [Kris’s] management.”  While Kris and Kim have not commented on the claims, this isn’t the first time it’s been reported that Kardashian may be looking to distance herself from Jenner, at least professionally, in the wake of her October robbery in Paris.  Radar Online claimed back in October that Kim Kardashian had grown wise to Kris Jenner’s “money making machine” after taking some downtime at the end of 2016, alleging at the time that Kim has been so busy with her career that she’s failed to realize how much Jenner, who is often referred to as her “momager,” had been controlling her life and career.  “Kim never realized how much [Kris] and the money-making machine was controlling her until this robbery,” an insider told the site of Kardashian’s feelings about Jenner at the time, months before it was reported that the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star is allegedly looking to “phase out” Kris from her career.  “Kim is just starting to think that maybe Kris’s intentions were not pure all along,” continued the source in October, adding that Kim has been doing a lot of thinking about her father Robert Kardashian while taking some time away which has allegedly helped her to get wise to Kris’s seemingly relentless pursuit of fame for herself and her family.  “[Kim] told her family that she wanted to be the girl that her father wanted her to be and not the girl that she became with Kris’s help,” a source revealed last year, just months before it was reported that a feud could be brewing between Kardashian and Jenner.  What do you think of reports claiming Kim Kardashian and mom Kris Jenner could be caught in a feud amid claims Kim is attempting to “phase out” her mother’s management?

Date: [Insert Date]

In an unprecedented turn of events, renowned celebrity Kim Kardashian has reportedly been making noteworthy and decisive moves towards redefining her personal and professional image. According to several unconfirmed reports circulating in the media, the iconic socialite has taken steps to distance herself from her long-time manager and beloved mother, Kris Jenner. This alleged shift in their relationship comes as Kim Kardashian resurfaces into the public eye after a traumatic robbery incident in October.

The multimillionaire entrepreneur, Kardashian, has enjoyed immense fame and appreciation for her undeniable talent for captivating the masses and staying at the forefront of the entertainment industry. However, recent developments suggest that the starlet is now poised to embark on a profound transformation, one that extends well beyond her external appearances. The reported overhaul is poised to impact every facet of Kim Kardashian's life, from her professional endeavors to her personal aspirations.

Various sources close to the Kardashian-Jenner circle have hinted towards this supposed change that Kim is undertaking, with speculations surrounding her readiness to venture into unknown territories. By apparently sidelining her own mother, Kris Jenner, who has played a pivotal role in shaping her career and managing her public persona, Kardashian is seemingly taking charge of her own destiny like never before.

The numerous reports suggest that the social media and fashion mogul's recent robbery ordeal in Paris last year has deeply influenced her personal outlook. Seen as a life-altering event that undoubtedly cast a shadow over her life, the incident appears to have served as a catalyst for Kim Kardashian's decision to redefine her image and assert her independence in all aspects of her life.

While details surrounding Kim's supposed total image overhaul remain scarce and unconfirmed, sources close to the star have hinted towards a rejuvenation of sorts. It is suggested that Kardashian's decision reflects a desire to reset her public persona, redefining her priorities and aspirations with an evolved focus on philanthropy, business ventures, and empowerment. Observers have noted that Kardashian's growing family, with her husband Kanye West and their children, has also contributed to her introspection and desire for a fresh start.

Notwithstanding the speculative nature of these reports, Kim Kardashian's long-standing reputation for shrewdness and an inclination towards rebranding cannot be overlooked. Throughout her widely publicized career, she has exhibited an unrelenting ability to adapt, often leaving her fanbase and critics in awe. If true, this alleged distancing from her mother and manager, Kris Jenner, serves as a testament to her determination to carve her own path and redefine her identity.

As the news continues to ripple through the media landscape, one thing is certain: Kim Kardashian's reported image overhaul has captured the attention of the world. Whether she finds herself on a transformative journey guided by her newfound independence, taking control of her own destiny, only time will tell. However, one cannot help but remain fascinated by the ever-evolving persona of this remarkable celebrity and the choices that she makes along her extraordinary path."

gossipcop-3967904178,"Watch Entertainment Tonight on Yahoo View.  Music’s odd couple, Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton — aka the rocker and the country boy — have never been free of gossip speculating about their relationship. Apparently, the latest news is that the two are through. In Touch Weekly reports that Shelton actually unceremoniously dumped Stefani in February before embarking on a tour.  But wait — if that’s the case, then why is Stefani appearing with him on stage? And not just appearing … they’re appearing pretty cuddly. The singer posted an Instagram shot on Mar. 14 of the two embracing on what appears to be the most recent date of his “Country Music Freaks” trek.      This isn’t the first such picture she has shared since February. She posted several different angles of a jumbotron kiss on Feb. 25, and on March 11, one of herself hanging out with country up-and-comer Carly Pearce, who is an opener on Shelton’s tour, and another that shows off a backstage crowd (including Shelton and her younger brother Todd) in Greensboro, N.C.      Additionally, she sent good wishes to him on Mar. 1 — when Shelton was reportedly attempting to power through a Houston date while sick with the flu — and shared his latest video, “I Lived It” with a glowing string of hashtags.      So if the breakup is fake news, what spurred the rumors? According to In Touch‘s “insider” source, all of Stefani’s social media support is “a desperate attempt to ignore the truth,” and Shelton dumped her due to her “neediness and all the drama: her demanding, critical ex-husband, and her jealousy of him and other women.”  If this is to be believed, current Voice champion Chloe Kohanski was a factor in the breakup — Coach Shelton was apparently getting too close for Stefani’s comfort — as well as Shelton’s ex-wife Miranda Lambert, with whom the outlet claims he has rekindled a friendship and is “sharing intimate details” of his life.  Shelton isn’t reciprocating Stefani’s loving social media deluge — but then again, he’s never been one to do so. His social media accounts, once a source of ribald jokes, have developed gradually into a more businesslike platform to market his music and work on The Voice. He does, however, maintain a picture of Stefani as his profile photo.  Read more from Yahoo Entertainment:",1,en,"Watch Entertainment Tonight on Yahoo View.

gossipcop-1634815619,"California is “the darkest state in the Union,” according to country singer Dolly Parton, who claims that the state has been hit with a series of “Biblical disasters” in recent times as punishment for “embracing Satan and rejecting God.”  Parton predicted Los Angeles will suffer a similar fate to Sodom and Gomorrah, the Biblical cities synonymous with vice, darkness and impenitent sin.  “California just keeps on being hit by disaster after disaster as foretold in the Bible,” the Grammy Award-winning entertainer and businesswoman told guests at Dolly Parton’s Stampede, a dinner and entertainment evening.  “Pestilence, and epidemics, and crime, and disease. And you know what? They don’t even realize what is happening to them. They are so corrupted, they can’t even see what is right in front of their eyes.”  “First they had the drought that lasted years and years, killing off billions and billions of dollars in crops, and making the soil so incredibly dry that a large rainstorm could easily turn into a major flood.  “Then they had the fires. Awful, awful fires. Historical, deadly fires. Thousands lost their homes, scores lost their lives and their livelihoods. Did you know the Thomas fire is still burning? In the winter!“  “And now they just had dozens of homes destroyed by mudslides,” Tennessee-born Parton said, making reference to the mudslides that have killed 15 people, with the toll expected to climb above 30. The mudslide hit an affluent part of California, and damaged Oprah Winfrey’s house.  “When they get hit with the ‘Big One‘, Parton said, referencing the popular name for the super quake expected to rock California in the future, “then we will know that the End Times have truly begun.”  “And don’t forget the sexual abuse scandals rocking Hollywood. They are being punished for embracing Satan and rejecting God.”  Is California suffering from bad weather and bad luck, or is Parton right? Could a vengeful God be punishing California for decades of vice and sin?  Parton, who has sold more than 100 million records worldwide and been nominated for two Academy Awards, has previously stated that she considers herself an entertainer, and doesn’t believe it is her role to get involved with politics.  At last year’s Emmys, Parton was joined onstage by Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda to present an award. Tomlin and Fonda took the opportunity to criticize President Donald Trump, but Parton refused to join in, maintaining a dignified silence.",1,en,"California is “the darkest state in the Union,” according to country singer Dolly Parton, who claims that the state has been hit with a series of “Biblical disasters” in recent times as punishment for “embracing Satan and rejecting God.”","California Deemed ""The Darkest State in the Union"" 

Renowned country singer, Dolly Parton, has made shocking claims, stating that California has earned the dubious title of being ""the darkest state in the Union."" Parton fervently asserts that the Golden State has been plagued by an assortment of calamities, which she describes as ""Biblical disasters."" According to the songstress, these misfortunes befalling California are nothing less than divine retribution for allegedly ""embracing Satan and rejecting God.""

Parton's bold declaration has sparked widespread debate and garnered significant attention, as many seek to understand the basis of her grave accusations against the vibrant and diverse state. While it is within the rights of any individual to express their views, it is crucial to critically analyze such statements, considering their implications and the evidence supporting them.

It is important to note that attributing natural disasters to divine punishment has a long history, rooted in various religious beliefs throughout human civilization. Such claims, however, require substantial corroborating evidence to be considered not only valid but also reasonable. Therefore, it is essential to scrutinize Parton's statements with a discerning eye, employing an objective lens.

California, a state known for its breathtaking landscapes, technological advancements, and cultural significance, has indeed endured its share of calamities. Ranging from devastating wildfires that have charred vast stretches of land to severe droughts that have threatened its water resources, California has confronted numerous challenges in recent times.

Yet, it is imperative not to let speculation overshadow scientific analysis when seeking explanations for these events. Researchers and experts in the fields of ecology, meteorology, and seismology dedicate their lives to understanding these phenomena, striving to provide evidence-based explanations rather than relying on personal convictions or religious interpretations.

Scientists attribute the wildfires that have ravaged California's forests and properties to a combination of climatic factors. Prolonged drought conditions, fueled by rising global temperatures, have led to drier vegetation, creating ideal conditions for wildfires to spread rapidly and unpredictably. These factors, in conjunction with human activities and land management practices, contribute to the severity of the fires experienced in the state.

Similarly, California's susceptibility to earthquakes, though a natural consequence of its position atop several active fault lines, is not indicative of divine punishment but rather a geological phenomenon. The state's complex tectonic makeup and motion of the Earth's crust along these faults periodically result in seismic activity, with varying degrees of intensity and impact.

While these natural disasters have undoubtedly caused immense suffering and loss, attributing them to a religious narrative overshadows the urgency of addressing the underlying scientific, environmental, and social factors that contribute to their occurrence and impact.

Dolly Parton's assertion that California's challenges stem from ""embracing Satan and rejecting God"" should be seen as an individual's personal interpretation of events. It is essential to foster respectful, evidence-based conversations when discussing matters of profound significance, such as faith, spirituality, and the environment. By doing so, we can collectively work towards greater understanding and resilience, valuing the plurality of beliefs and opinions that define our society."
gossipcop-874373,"If you're a Teen Mom: OG fan, then by now, you've probably heard the news that Amber Portwood and Matt Baier have broken up.  Fans have been hoping these two would part ways pretty much from the day they went public with their relationship, and now that Amber has a new boyfriend, it seems it's safe to say she and Matt are well and truly over.  But while TMOG viewers may be thrilled by the split, Matt is most definitely not.  The newly single Baier opened up about his split from Amber in a recent interview with E! News:  ""I'm trying to do a lot of work on myself because I realize now the downfall of our relationship was my fault,"" he explained.  ""When you're thrust into the spotlight like that, it can affect you. My mistake was taking our relationship for granted.""  Baier says the high-profile nature of the relationship was part of the problem (which is odd, because he never would have met Amber if she weren't on TV), but he also accepts responsibility for being a less-than-stellar partner:  ""What I've learned from this is you have to do the work,"" he told the outlet.  ""You have to make the person you're with feel loved every single day. I forgot to do that and now I'm paying the price.""  Matt says he's full of regrets over the way his relationship played out, and if given a second chance, he would change everything about the way he behaved.

Ultimately, my hope was to get a place where Amber could come visit me and we could work on our issues. Obviously, that didn't happen.""  But despite the fact that Amber is in a new relationship, Matt is still hopeful that she'll find her way back to him:  ""I'll hold out hope for a reconciliation. But if nothing else, I hope we can stay friends,"" Baier says.  ""We started off as best friends and that's what I miss the most from her—her friendship. To not have that is painful. When something happens, my natural instinct still is to call her and tell her everything. She was my family.""  As though that's not depressing enough, Baier concluded the info with some insights into his day-to-day life post-Amber:  ""I've been making a living through my [poker] winnings,"" he says.  ""That said, I'm not really enjoying it. This isn't the life I want to live.""  Yeesh.

'Jason Bateman’s wife convinced Justin to go to Cabo. She has been the mediator in recent months, trying to get Jen and Justin to work through their problems and save their marriage,' a source told Us Weekly in an article on Thursday.  'The Cabo trip was a make or break vacation for Jen and Justin. They went away with their friends hoping to have fun and work on it,' the insider said of the post-Christmas vacation.

'Normally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly,' said the statement released by Jennifer's publicist Stephen Huvane.  'Whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else's fictional narrative.

This desperate endeavor took place alongside close friends and fellow actors Jason Bateman and his wife, in a bid to find solace and rekindle the flickering flame of their once-envied relationship.

Sources close to the couple have revealed that Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux, recognized as one of Tinseltown's most glamorous power couples, had been facing considerable strains in their marriage for quite some time. As whispers of an impending split started to circulate within the inner circles of Hollywood, it seems that the duo decided to take matters into their own hands, embarking on a pilgrimage to the sun-drenched shores of Mexico's picturesque coastline.

Obtaining exclusivity from their respective work obligations, the quintet retreated to a lavish oceanfront villa, enshrouded by the pristine white sandy beaches and swaying palm trees that lined the coast. Nestled amidst this idyllic setting, the group immersed themselves in an environment that offered the utmost privacy, ensuring minimal intrusion from prying eyes and, more importantly, relentless paparazzi scrutiny.

Under the watchful eye of the sound-breaking waves, their sojourn became something of a therapeutic sanctuary. Jennifer and Justin, renowned for their relentless work ethic and hectic schedules, finally had the opportunity to pause, reflect, and possibly heal the fractures that had threatened to dismantle their union. Amidst the breathtaking surroundings, they embarked on an intensive journey of exploration, both into their relationship and towards themselves.

While specifics of their healing process remain guarded, the presence of dear friends, Jason Bateman and his wife, played an integral role. Their unwavering support and counsel undoubtedly served as a guiding light during this tumultuous escapade. Friends, after all, are the pillars that hold us up during times of hardship, and in this case, their steadfast camaraderie sought to fortify the bond between Jennifer and Justin.

However, as with any narrative, shadows linger even on the sunniest of shores. Despite their heartfelt endeavors and earnest exploration, it is important to approach this tale with a balanced perspective. Difficulties within relationships are often intricate and multilayered, defying resolution in the boundaries of a single vacation. While this last-ditch effort demonstrates their undying commitment to each other, it is uncertain whether it will be enough to salvage their fading love.

As the Mexican sun sets over the horizon, casting a golden hue upon the sand, it remains unclear whether this idyllic escape has indeed provided the much-needed solace for Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux. Only time will tell if their determined journey will prove successful, reigniting the embers of their love or whether this desperate attempt will be revealed as the final flicker before darkness consumes their once-thriving romance.

Amidst the intrigue and uncertainty, their countless fans around the globe can do nothing but watch and hope that the powerful forces of love and resilience triumph, forever altering the trajectory of Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux's intertwined lives."

In a video being circulated, which is entitled - Rihanna: ‘If Jesus Hasn’t Answered Your Prayers, Try Satan’, published December 2, 2017, on the World News Today YouTube Channel, a scripted voice says that Rihanna told the audience that growing up in Bridgetown was not easy and that you have to work twice as hard to make it. And the British anonymous voice went on to say that she said:  ""You have to hustle. I’m still hustling, but I am living proof that you can do anything... If you came here for tips I can give y’all the biggest one straight off...  ""If y'all have prayed to Jesus for years, prayed with all your hearts and got nothing back from him? ... Jesus doesn't care about you. Do you really even think he even listening? Hot tip y'all because you are my people, be efficient, go to satan.""  Then it went on to claim that the Prime Minister of Barbados the Rt. Hon. Freundel Stuart intervened hastily and shocked parents removed their children. On the night in question, the Prime Minister conferred the title of Cultural Ambassador on Robyn 'Rihanna' Fenty.  The only thing the video got right in that blurb was the name of Barbados' Prime Minister.  There was also an article on YourNewsWire.com with the same title and the same quotes written by Baxter Dmitry and posted December 1, 2017.  Loop News was there on site and recorded Rihanna's speech. Honoured, the young Grammy-award winner encouraged children and persons to believe in their dreams and have faith in God.  Rihanna told the crowd which included her friends and family, and numerous dignitaries, that she had no idea how she would get discovered on this little Rock but her dreams started on Westbury New Road, now named Rihanna Drive and she believed in her dreams, so ""believe in your dreams"", as cliche as it may sound.  Rihanna added:  ""I always knew it would happen, I always focused on the result, and that kind of faith, it really was just faith that childlike faith, that even now when I get a little bit discouraged or doubtful, it’s the thing that I go back to, having faith in God, like that even as a child.”  (Photo caption: Rihanna with her head bowed during the opening prayer at the renaming ceremony. (PHOTO: Richard Grimes))  On the fake YouTube video many people in the comments said that the video was a hoax and a lie. People called for the voice clip and video showing Rihanna making that fabricated speech and they asked why the video was missing from all other news agencies.  The ceremony was also broadcast live on TV in Barbados so tens of thousands of Bajans can refute the lies in the video and article aforementioned as well.

Date: December 4, 2017

[City Name]: In a bid to maintain journalistic integrity and debunk the spurious claims surrounding Barbados' iconic music sensation Rihanna, we diligently investigated the recent rumor circulating about her alleged affiliation with Satan. This investigation aims to separate truth from fiction and ensure accurate information reaches the public.

The rumor mill has been in overdrive, attempting to tarnish the global superstar's reputation by suggesting connections to controversial beliefs. Recently, a video entitled ""Rihanna: ‘If Jesus Hasn’t Answered Your Prayers, Try Satan’"" emerged on the YouTube channel, World News Today, stirring up concerns and doubts among fans and skeptics alike.

Whilst the video's scripted voice ostensibly claims that Rihanna herself openly advocates the pursuit of Satanic ideologies, our investigation has conclusively determined that this is nothing more than a baseless fabrication intended to mislead viewers and sensationalize events.

But what are the facts? Examining the origins of this content, it becomes clear that the dubious video appeared on December 2, 2017, without any reliable sourcing or verified credentials. The World News Today YouTube Channel itself, notorious for publishing misleading and fake news stories, has perpetuated this unsubstantiated narrative.

However, our pursuit of truth led us to contact Rihanna's representatives who swiftly dismissed these allegations as unfounded and categorically false. Rihanna's camp expressed immense disappointment that such spurious claims are perpetuated by unreliable sources, undermining the singer's steadfast dedication to charitable causes and goodwill.

Furthermore, we reached out to attendees of Rihanna's recent concerts and engaged with fans via social media platforms. Their consistent testimonials not only support Rihanna's representation as an artist who emphasizes hard work and resilience but also showcase her unyielding gratitude towards her upbringing in Bridgetown, Barbados. These first-hand accounts collectively discredit the claims perpetuated in the malicious video.

Rihanna, an accomplished and celebrated artist, has shared her story with her audience on numerous occasions. By acknowledging the challenges she faced growing up in Bridgetown, she sought to inspire those who yearn to carve out their own success against all odds. It is critical to recognize her message of perseverance and dedication, honoring the importance of hard work and commitment to achieving one's aspirations.

It remains our responsibility as aware and discerning citizens to differentiate between genuine news sources providing accurate information and those that propagate falsehoods for personal gain. Our investigation into this disreputable YouTube video concludes that it lacks credibility, veracity, and proper sourcing.

As the news landscape becomes increasingly complex, it is vital that we remain vigilant in our quest for truth. Let us stand united against the dissemination of false information and fortify our commitment to objective journalism, ensuring that rumors are debunked promptly.

Letting a glimpse of her trademark flame hair shine through, the head piece perfectly framed her pretty face, accentuated by a touch of lipgloss and eyebrow pencil. She teamed it with a black bomber jacket and black trousers as she stopped to check out the cosmetics. The actress was seen posing with excited fans at the event, before making a quiet exit.

""That's something you can't take away - swinging around naked on a wrecking ball lives forever,"" she joked. ""I am never living that down.

The footage saw the singer stripped down to only a pair of Doctor Marten boots, while swinging on a large wrecking ball.

The footage sees Miley frolicking on the beach, dressed in a variety of white lacy outfits whilst proudly showing off her engagement ring. Speaking about her incredible comeback to the music scene with Malibu, Miley confessed Liam is the biggest 'influence' in her new direction. She said on Australian radio station The Kyle & Jackie O Show: ""I definitely would be lying if I said that wasn't the influence or why I'm here… Because it's like, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.""",1,en,Miley Cyrus regrets Wrecking Ball video: 'I'm never living that down' Miley Cyrus has revealed she is 'embarrassed' by her Wrecking Ball video,"Miley Cyrus, the renowned American pop sensation, has recently come forward expressing her profound regret over her iconic music video for the popular song ""Wrecking Ball."" In a heartfelt admission, the artist confessed to feeling deeply embarrassed by her past work and acknowledged the lasting impact it has had on her public image.

The Wrecking Ball video, released back in September 2013, instantly captivated audiences worldwide with its provocative and controversial nature. Sporting a distinctive blonde pixie cut and adopting a daring and audacious persona, Cyrus rode the waves of fame with an irrepressible spirit. However, it seems the artist's evolution has allowed her to reflect on her previous decisions, leading her to a newfound place of vulnerability and growth.

In an exclusive interview, the 28-year-old performer opened up about the video's profound impact on her life, revealing, ""I'm never living that down."" Clearly regretful, she acknowledged the undeniable truth that her youthful misstep has taken on a life of its own in the unforgiving public eye. Cyrus further described how this chapter of her career has overshadowed her more recent artistic triumphs, causing her to question her creative choices and artistic integrity.

The Wrecking Ball video, directed by the renowned Terry Richardson, featured Cyrus swinging daringly on a large wrecking ball while clad in minimal clothing, making headlines and sparking countless discussions. This visually stunning and boundary-pushing production quickly became a hot topic worldwide, which initially propelled Cyrus into the spotlight like never before. Yet, just as every coin has two sides, this newfound fame came at a cost that has haunted the young superstar ever since.

In the ensuing years, Cyrus has embarked on a remarkable journey of self-discovery and reinvention, exploring diverse musical genres and channeling her energy towards more thoughtful and introspective projects. Critics and fans alike have lauded her for her raw talent, impressive vocal range, and ability to fearlessly navigate the music industry on her own terms.

However, it is evident that even amidst her impressive artistic endeavors, Cyrus remains shackled to the legacy of her past. The Wrecking Ball video is an inescapable symbol that has inadvertently defined her image for years, leaving her feelings of embarrassment and regret to this day.

While some may view Miley Cyrus's recent admission as a moment of weakness, it is essential to remember that artists, like any other human beings, grow and evolve with time. The ability to reflect on past choices serves as a testament to personal growth, maturity, and the relentless pursuit of authenticity.

In the face of criticism and the burden of a seemingly indelible stigma, Miley Cyrus stands as a genuine example of resilience and determination. Her journey beyond the Wrecking Ball video serves as a reminder that growth is an ongoing process, one filled with self-realization, learning, and evolving perspectives. For now, though, Cyrus will continue to battle the ghosts of her past as she forges an unwavering path towards a future untethered from the shadows of regret."

gossipcop-2682199068,"Reverend Swadley – the local wedding priest and friend of the Pitt family – has confirmed to friends that the A-list couple recently spent a week with Brad’s family, discussing detailed plans for a wedding.  It’s believed the loved-up stars had flown to Missouri because Jen was desperate to reconnect with Brad’s mum, Jane, who she’d developed a very close bond with throughout the time of their first marriage.  During the seven-day visit, it’s been revealed that Jane orchestrated a meeting with the family priest Reverend Swadley – hoping it would be the gentle push Brad and Jen would need to make their reignited relationship official once again.  ‘Reverend Swadley met Jen recently at a family function that Brad’s mum, Jane, threw at their family home in Missouri,’ a close friend of the pastor’s told New Idea exclusively.  ‘Jen accompanied Brad home on the trip and attended church services with the family as well as joining Brad at meetings at the now-retired reverend’s home, who Brad reconnected with after he decided to find himself and renew his faith, following his split from Ange.  ‘He remarked at how at ease Jen was with his family, who clearly adore her, and how everyone said how much she’s been missed and how happy they all were to have her back in Brad’s – and their – lives.’  The source goes on to reveal that Reverend Swadley spoke at length with Brad and Jen about getting married as soon as possible, in Missouri, in a small ceremony, with just local friends and family present.  ‘Reverend Swadley revealed how in love Brad and Jen were and how they planned to officially wed as soon as their divorces were finalised, with him agreeing to conduct the ceremony and welcome them both back into the church,’ the friend of the pastor told New Idea.  Reverend Swadley revealed to our source that it was clear Jen loved seeing Brad’s family again, spending long days talking and laughing for the first time since their 2005 divorce.  ‘Jen spent five days reconnecting with Brad’s parents, brother and sister and many of his childhood friends who he remains close to,’ a friend of the pastor reveals.  Brad Pitt's parents are nothing but supportive Getty  ‘He said Jen kept saying how grateful she was that they’d been brought back together. And how they’ll both be baptised later this year before they officially wed – with Jen’s father, John, vowing to be at her side for the service and give her away again at their wedding, which will hopefully take place shortly after and be far more low-key than their original star-studded nuptials in Malibu.’  It’s the latest chapter in the pair’s rekindled romance since Jen announced her split from estranged husband Justin Theroux in February. She has wasted no time in rebuilding her relationship with ex-husband Brad, spending time with his six children, and developing a unique and special bond with his 11-year-old daughter Shiloh.  It’s that close relationship between Jen and his kids that has prompted Brad to want to marry Jen as soon as soon as possible.  ‘Brad’s mum Jane was all over them to get married as soon as possible, but the truth is Brad needs no convincing,’ says a source close to Brad. ‘They still want to keep this relationship close to their chest and out of the public eye, but behind closed doors they couldn’t be happier.  ‘And for Brad, seeing how much his children – especially Shiloh – love Jen has just made his heart soar. He knows he wants Jen to be his wife again.  ‘We’re pretty sure they’ll be married in Missouri before the end of the year, Brad and Jen are both keen to push through their divorces as soon as possible so they can walk down the aisle together.

Her account, posted early Saturday morning, comes in the wake of the continuing #metoo movement and the launch of the Time’s Up campaign to combat sexual harassment and assault.  In a Facebook post, Dushku wrote that she was assaulted while working with Kramer on the 1994 James Cameron film “True Lies.” According to her post, Kramer molested her in a Miami hotel room, where he “laid me down on the bed, wrapped me with his gigantic writhing body, and rubbed all over me.” Kramer would have been 36 at the time.  Dushku alleges that he “methodically built my and my parents’ trust, for months grooming me,” and told her parent that he would take her for a swim in the hotel’s pool. Instead, her took her to his hotel room, where he “disappeared in the bathroom and emerged, naked, bearing nothing but a small hand towel held flimsy at his mid-section.”  Kramer told Variety Saturday morning that Dushku’s allegations were “absolutely not true.” According to Kramer, Dushku swam in the hotel pool with him and other members of the stunt crew, including Dushku’s stunt double.

Amidst a climate where rumors and sensationalism dominate conversations, Kunis stands firm, resolutely ignoring the white noise that engulfs her life and the lives of her loved ones.

Harry Styles & Taylor Swift Back Together? — Texting After Nadine Leopold Breakup  It’s true that Taylor, 25, reached out to Harry, 21, after his breakup, but sadly for her, he wasn’t very responsive.  “Since the split, Taylor sent him a text just seeing how he was doing,” a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.”  Taylor may have been trying to play it cool with a casual message, but according to our insider, “Their mutual friends say she is definitely still hung up on him. She thinks they have potential despite their past breakup. But Harry isn’t interested. He is actually kicking himself over losing Nadine.”  Ouch! That has to hurt. Poor Taylor! We have to say though, if Harry doesn’t appreciate Tay for the treasure she is, then we think he’s not the guy for her!  Taylor Swift Wants Harry Styles Back After His Split From Nadine Leopold  As HollywoodLife.com previously reported, Taylor was secretly overjoyed when Nadine, 21, dumped Harry.  “She still has feelings for Harry and the fact that Nadine broke up with him kind of gives her pleasure,” another source told us exclusively. “Now he knows how it feels [to have his heart broken]. She never thought Harry and Nadine were right for each other anyway.”  Well, what do YOU think, HollywoodLifers? Do you want Harry and Taylor to get back together? Tell us how you feel!  — Tierney McAfee, Reporting by Tim Plant",1,en,"Now that Harry and Nadine are no longer an item, Taylor is hoping to rekindle her romance with the One Direction hottie.","In a surprising turn of events, the latest buzz surrounding the ever-popular pop sensation, Taylor Swift, has sent waves of anticipation throughout the entertainment industry. Following the recent news of the split between former lovebirds Harry Styles and Nadine, sources close to Swift reveal her newfound hopes of reigniting her past romance with the heartthrob vocalist of One Direction.

Known for her deeply emotive songwriting and for baring her soul through heartfelt lyrics, Taylor Swift has consistently captivated audiences with her personal relationships, providing an intimate glimpse into her heartfelt experiences. As fans and critics alike were still recovering from her highly successful album, ""Folklore,"" which delved into a more introspective and mature side of her artistry, Swift has managed to redirect the spotlight toward her ever-evolving love life yet again.

After parting ways with British actor Tom Hiddleston, Swift's romantic life had remained relatively enigmatic, keeping both her supporters and the paparazzi guessing. However, the 31-year-old songstress has reportedly taken this opportune moment to explore the possibility of rekindling her connection with former flame, Harry Styles.

The news of Harry and Nadine's split, which surfaced only recently, has set Taylor's plans in motion. Although the details behind the breakup between the British heartthrob and his former girlfriend remain scarce, insiders suggest that the split was amicable, leaving both parties open to pursuing their own paths in the wake of their separation.

Swift and Styles' history is no stranger to headlines, as their blazing hot romance allegedly took place back in 2012. Their whirlwind romance had its own share of ups and downs, playing out on a very public stage. The moments they shared were often documented through paparazzi lenses and immortalized in the lyrics of Taylor Swift's chart-topping hits.

Now, with the stage set for a possible reunion, sources close to Taylor Swift reveal that the songstress has been increasingly reflective about their shared history. The passionate and emotional bond they once forged was undeniably intense, as their public outings were a constant topic of discussion and intrigue.

While Taylor has focused on her music career and personal growth in recent years, insiders suggest that she genuinely hopes for a chance to reignite the flame that once burned between her and the enigmatic Harry Styles. No official confirmation has emerged from either camp as of yet, but the rumor mill continues to churn with the possibility of a highly anticipated reunion between these two titans of the music industry.

Fans are already brimming with excitement, eagerly awaiting any potential developments. Given Taylor Swift's history of turning heartbreak into chart-topping anthems, one can only wonder what musical masterpiece would be born from a potential reunification between the two magnetic forces.

As anticipation builds, we are left to wonder: will Taylor Swift and Harry Styles once again grace the headlines as they embark on a journey to rediscover the love they once shared? Only time will tell if destiny will intertwine their paths once more."

gossipcop-890653,"By Heidi Peiper / Starbucks Newsroom For 20 years, the return of the Starbucks holiday cups have marked the arrival of the season. It’s a ritual for many that’s as beloved as that first sip of Peppermint Mocha. It’s not easy to find the very first Starbucks holiday cups, which made their debut in stores in 1997. Few were saved, and electronic design files were lost in an earthquake in 2001. Even an Internet search is unyielding, with the cups having made their arrival long before the first selfie. Luckily, designer Sandy Nelson, a Starbucks alumna, stashed away a set of these cups, along with other artifacts from her 14 years working in Starbucks Creative Studio. She remembers the design fondly, one of her first assignments at Starbucks. “It was August, and I had just started with the company,” Nelson said. “We were working on holiday creative for the season to come. We had what felt like a hundred cup designs pinned up on the wall. Then Howard [Schultz] came by, looked at all of them, and picked my design. I couldn’t believe mine was chosen.” That first cup wasn’t really red – at least not the holiday red that Starbucks has become known for. It was closer to a magenta, and the cup also came in three more colors: sapphire, emerald and amethyst. The design featured swirls and hand-drawn holly leaves that were flecked with coffee beans. Download video for media use Nelson was in Anchorage visiting a friend when she saw the cups in a store for the first time. “I remember seeing the cups piled high on the counter, and I realized ‘this is big,’” she said. “It was thrilling.” It would be two more years, in 1999, before the Starbucks cup would don its signature red color. Jon Cannell, manager Creative Design, was part of the design team that year. “I remember it all started when the creative director asked us, ‘What is holiday red? Is it burgundy? Is it more of a ruby color,'” Cannell said. “We brought in all these holiday items in a range of reds, and we landed on a red that we all agreed on.” That year, they settled on a vibrant shade of candy-apple red with whimsical drawings of snowflakes, stockings and other images that evoked the spirit of the holiday. “There was a response to that shade of red,” Cannell said. “It was a joyous color, and it really resonated with customers.” Over two decades, Starbucks holiday cups became emblematic of the holiday, with designs that reflect the joy of the season with scenes of celebration and gathering. That shade of red was the foundation for the cups, the canvas for each creation that has evolved over the years. The cup became a symbol of the holidays, the anticipation growing with each passing year. Over the years, online countdown clocks have sprung up as speculation builds on social media. It is now a fixture in popular culture, the star of both morning talk shows and late night stand-up routines. Passions for the cup have run so high that even the design could become controversial, as it did in 2015 when Starbucks introduced a modern two-toned, ombré red design. The 2017 design echoes themes from cups of years past with intimate moments connected by swirls of red and white.

In the realm of journalism, integrity and responsible reporting are paramount to ensure the dissemination of accurate and factual information to the public. Recent events surrounding certain claims propagated by the National Enquirer have once again raised concerns regarding the potential impact of sensationalist narratives on public perception.

One notable personality who has found herself entangled in the web of the National Enquirer's questionable journalistic practices is Megyn, a prominent figure in the media industry. While she may understandably be alarmed by their approach, it is crucial to examine the credibility of the source in question before engaging in undue apprehension.

There is no denying that the National Enquirer has gained notoriety by promoting sensationalist narratives that veer far from responsible journalism. Incidents such as their support for the notion that Elvis Presley still walks among us or the highly controversial theory connecting Ted Cruz's father to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy stand as glaring examples of their tendency towards sensationalism.

However, it is important to recognize that the National Enquirer represents a fringe element of the media landscape, operating with a vastly different set of standards than reputable news organizations. Established news outlets adhere to rigorous ethical guidelines that prioritize accuracy, accountability, and the pursuit of truth. Such organizations foster public trust by diligently verifying information and citing credible sources before publishing any story.

It is these principles that set apart reliable journalists like Megyn from the often outlandish and unverified reports propagated by tabloids such as the National Enquirer. Regardless of the impact that such sensationalist narratives may have on public opinion, it is essential for discerning individuals to differentiate between reputable news sources and those driven by sensationalism and profit.

Journalists, like Megyn, who strive to uphold the values of responsible journalism ought to focus on producing content grounded in integrity, facts, and thorough analysis. Their dedication to providing the public with trustworthy information should not be overshadowed by the misleading narratives propagated by outlets like the National Enquirer.

As society increasingly grapples with the challenges posed by misinformation and fake news, it is crucial for citizens to develop critical thinking skills and remain vigilant when consuming information. Vigilance, coupled with responsible journalism, is the foundation upon which an informed and democratic society can flourish.

In conclusion, the recent concerns involving the National Enquirer's sensationalist narratives serve as a stark reminder of the importance of reliable and responsible journalism. While Megyn's worries are understandable, it is essential to remember that the National Enquirer represents a fringe element of the media landscape and should not overshadow the broader dedication of reputable journalists to upholding the principles that guide their profession."

The photo shoot promises to be Caitlyn's finest hour since she first announced her transition in an interview with ABC’s Diane Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July.

Taking it to that level and unveiling her [new body] with a fully naked photo spread is going way too far.'  Kardashian momager Kris, who is said to have known about Jenner’s surgery in advance, has vowed to stop the shoot from going ahead, according to the insider.  ‘She knew the surgery was inevitable and it was bound to happen,’ said the source. ‘But she says she will do everything in her power to stop the shoot if she can.'

Jenner wrote of the $20,000 operation: 'The surgery was a success, and I feel not only wonderful but liberated […] I am going to live authentically for the first time in my life.  ‘I am going to have an enthusiasm for life that I have not had in 39 years since the Olympics, almost two thirds of my life.'  But the book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife and step-children.  Sources close to the family told DailyMail.com that Jenner’s ‘unpredictable’ behavior has also played a part in their current estrangement.  The insider said: ‘[The book] is definitely something that she’s wanted to do for a while and it was just a matter of time before she got it done.  ‘But the family were like, it’s probably going to reopen the drama of everything [that has happened].  ‘They were worried because she’s been so unpredictable lately and just trying to get out into the limelight.’  Jenner's book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife  A second leaked extract from the memoir has already proven embarrassing, after Jenner claimed the late Robert Kardashian knew O.J.

The late night host, who grew up and studied in the city, struggled to hide his emotion as he paid tribute to the victims and urged for stricter gun control on Monday’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live.” See stars’ reaction tweets below.  Kimmel went on, growing angrier as he disagreed with those who ignore gun violence. “I’ve been reading comments from people who say ‘This is terrible, but there’s nothing we could do about it.’ I disagree with that intensely. There are a lot of things we can do about it. But we don’t. Which is interesting, because when someone with a beard attacks us, we tap phones, we invoke travel bans, we build walls. We take every possible precaution to make sure it doesn’t happen again. But when an American buys a gun and kills other Americans, then there’s nothing we can do about that. Because [of] the Second Amendment. Our forefathers wanted us to have AK47s, is the argument.”  And before showing the faces of the 56 senators who voted against new and tighter gun laws just days after the shooting in Orlando last year, Kimmel said, “They should be praying. They should be praying for God to forgive them for letting the gun lobby run this country. Because it is, it is so crazy.”  Among those commenting on the late night host’s powerful and emotional monologue is Rosie O’Donnell, who said, “Jimmy Kimmel is an American hero – [watch] his Emotional Monologue About The Mass Shooting In Las Vegas #useURvoice.” Olivia Wilde similarly wrote, “A powerful call to action.

Opening the show with a heavy heart, the renowned talk show host found himself grappling with the unimaginable reality that his beloved hometown had become the backdrop for an unspeakable act of violence. With emotions raw and visible on his face, Kimmel's unwavering strength and heartfelt words sought to console a nation in mourning.

As the world struggles to comprehend the incomprehensible, Kimmel's impassioned plea served as a stark reminder that these moments of unity and support define our resilience as a society and our capacity to find solace in one another.

""This morning, we have children without parents, fathers without sons, mothers without daughters. We lost two police officers, we lost a nurse from Tennessee, a special education teacher from a local school here in Manhattan Beach,"" Kimmel shared, his voice quavering but resolute. ""It's the kind of thing that makes you want to throw up or give up.""

Through his words, Kimmel highlighted the shared grief that reverberates across the nation, tapping into the collective sense of loss felt by millions. Even in his own sorrow, he urged the public to move past the initial shock, to channel their despair into meaningful support for victims and their families.

""This morning, we have children without parents, fathers without sons, mothers without daughters.""

As the city of Las Vegas grapples with the aftermath of this heart-wrenching incident, Kimmel lent his unwavering support to those in need, his voice resounding with compassion and empathy for a community facing unimaginable pain.

""Strangers lined up for hours to give blood. You can go to any blood bank in Nevada now and they'll make sure it goes to help people here,"" Kimmel urged, seeking to inspire acts of selflessness in the face of adversity.

The tragedy that unfolded on Sunday night at the Route 91 Harvest Festival has left a deep scar on the fabric of American society, a wound that won't easily heal. Kimmel's portrayal of anguish and heartache serves as a powerful reminder that these incidents should not be met with apathy or desolation, but rather usher forth a renewed commitment to unity, compassion, and resolute action.

In closing, the late-night host implored his viewers to hold tight to the love and humanity that binds us together, yearning for a world where such tragedies are consigned to history.

""So we'll pray for Las Vegas, pray for Orlando, pray for San Bernardino, pray for Aurora, pray for Sandy Hook. Pray for peace. And let's remember, love conquers hatred.""

Indeed, as we move through this dark chapter in American history, Kimmel's solemn and heartfelt words echo in our hearts, urging us to turn to one another for support and reminding us that it is only in solidarity that our nation can rebuild and progress."

I didn’t want to view myself as a victim so I suppressed it and pretended it never happened.”  As she was in a relationship with the perpetrator, Breslin was unsure if reporting the incident would cause more issues.  “I was in a relationship with my rapist and feared not being believed,” she wrote. “I also feared that if my case didn’t lead anywhere, he would still find out and hurt me even more.”  She continued, “Third, I knew how hurt my family and friends would be after finding out and I didn’t want to put them thru that.”  Breslin said she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder following the incident.

I didn’t want to view myself as a victim so I suppressed it and pretended it never happened.”  As she was in a relationship with the perpetrator, Breslin was unsure if reporting the incident would cause more issues.  “I was in a relationship with my rapist and feared not being believed,” she wrote. “I also feared that if my case didn’t lead anywhere, he would still find out and hurt me even more.”  She continued, “Third, I knew how hurt my family and friends would be after finding out and I didn’t want to put them thru that.”  Breslin said she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder following the incident. Despite making progress, the actress revealed she still has nightmares and flashbacks.  “I still jump when somebody touches me unexpectedly, even if it’s my best friend tapping me on the shoulder,” she wrote.  The Dirty Dancing reboot star said that claims that unreported rapes “don’t matter” is “unfair, untrue and unhelpful.”  “It’s like [saying] you got a black eye from being punched in the face, but because you didn’t call the police, you didn’t really get a black eye,” she explained.

gossipcop-12955535,"The FCC has decided against taking any action on Stephen Colbert’s May 1 Late Show broadcast, in which he treated President Donald Trump to a series of increasingly Rabelaisian insults, in response to on-air insults Trump had delivered earlier in the day to CBS News-man John Dickerson.  Colbert’s slew of frat-boy remarks culminated in a crack that the only thing Trump’s mouth is good for “is being Vladimir Putin’s [expletive] holster.” The naughty word was bleeped in the broadcast, and Colbert’s mouth was pixelated. But, intrepid journalists, who are paid to ferret out the truth, discovered what was the word, and they printed it – minus the offending syllable, of course.  All hell broke loose.  Trump called Colbert “no-talent guy.” Colbert’s monologue was plastered by some as inappropriately vulgar, by others as homophobic. The FCC received thousands of complaints. Reporters breathlessly reported Colbert was under FCC investigation, and a good time was had by all.  Today, however, the FCC put an end to the fun, saying in a statement: “Consistent with standard operating procedure, the FCC’s Enforcement Bureau has reviewed the complaints and the material that was the subject of these complaints.”  “The Bureau has concluded that there was nothing actionable under the FCC’s rules.”  In rough numbers, the FCC was saying that programs airing on broadcast TV stations before 10 PM are subject to fine if the commission determines they are “indecent.” Shows that run in late-night, however, have a different threshold: content must be ruled “obscene” for stations to be fined. FCC defines obscene as content that “must appeal to an average person’s prurient interest; depict or describe sexual conduct in a ‘patently offensive’ way; and, taken as a whole, lack serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.”  Here’s the monologue that launched a thousand complaints:",1,en,"The FCC has decided against taking any action on Stephen Colbert’s May 1 Late Show broadcast, in which he treated President Donald Trump to a series of increasingly Rabelaisian insults, in response to on-air insults Trump had delivered earlier in the day to CBS News-man John Dickerson.","The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has made the decision to refrain from taking any official action against the highly controversial broadcast of Stephen Colbert's ""The Late Show"" on May 1st. During this particular episode, Colbert unleashed a series of increasingly vulgar insults aimed at President Donald Trump, in direct response to the derogatory remarks Trump had made earlier that day regarding CBS News anchor, John Dickerson.

The FCC, responsible for monitoring and regulating broadcast content, has pondered the potential consequences of Colbert's on-air onslaught, meticulously reviewing the segment in question. After profound deliberation, the commission concluded that despite the coarse nature of Colbert's verbiage, no punitive action is warranted due to the First Amendment's protection of free speech rights.

Colbert's caustic monologue has stirred heated debates across the nation, with many scrutinizing the limits of freedom of speech and the role of public figures in maintaining decorum. The incident has reignited discussions on civility and proper conduct among media personalities, further deepening the divide already present in contemporary political discourse.

While the FCC acknowledges the polarizing nature of Colbert's remarks, it has chosen to prioritize constitutional principles over disciplinary measures. The commission recognizes that regulating and censoring the content broadcasted on national television should be approached with utmost care, protecting the democratic values of a society that thrives on the open exchange of ideas. It is aware that any attempt to suppress speech, even under the scrutiny of incivility, may inadvertently create a slippery slope threatening the very foundations of free expression.

However, public outcry and political opponents continue to condemn Colbert's derogatory comments, claiming that they represent an alarming degradation of public discourse and set an undesirable precedent for future discourse. Trump's supporters, in particular, have expressed disappointment in Colbert's choice of words, asserting that such behavior is unbecoming of a public figure entrusted with the responsibility of setting an example for the nation.

In response to the FCC's decision, Colbert's critics have called for enhanced media accountability and heightened self-regulation of the industry. Advocates argue that it is crucial for media professionals to recognize the power they wield and use it responsibly in a bid to foster a more constructive environment for political dialogue.

Amidst the controversy, the incident serves as a stark reminder of the profound divisions within the United States, reflecting a nation grappling with the spirit of its own free speech protections. The FCC's verdict, while neither entirely satisfying nor universally embraced, underscores that the boundaries of political discourse in the digital age are continually evolving, necessitating a thoughtful reevaluation of societal norms and expectations governing media conduct."

gossipcop-900306,"About 10 years ago, at the after-party for a wine auction in New Orleans, a woman in her 20s walked up to Mario Batali to introduce herself. As a chef, she was excited to meet one of the most revered figures in the restaurant industry. When they started talking, she recalls, she realized that he’d been drinking and he became what she characterized as “creepy” — “just giving me this provocative, icky feeling.” Minutes into their conversation, she recalls, he told her, “Come work for me, I’ll pay you double what you’re making.” Moments later, someone bumped her glass, spilling wine all over her chest and down her scooped-neck shirt. She alleges that Batali began rubbing her breasts with his bare hands while saying something like, “Let me help you with that,” as he groped her chest. “He just went to town, and I was so shocked,” the chef says. “Jaw on the ground, I just stepped back from him in utter disgust and walked away.” The chef is one of four women who allege that Batali touched them inappropriately in a pattern of behavior that appears to span at least two decades. Three of the women worked for Batali in some capacity during their careers. One former employee alleges that over the course of two years, he repeatedly grabbed her from behind and held her tightly against his body. Another former employee alleges that he groped her and that, in a separate incident, he compelled her to straddle him; another alleges that he grabbed her breasts at a party, though she no longer worked for him at the time. The woman whose allegations are described above has never worked for Batali, though she works in the restaurant industry. Batali was reprimanded for inappropriate behavior in the workplace as recently as two months ago. According to a spokesperson for Batali & Bastianich Hospitality Group — the restaurant-management services company that provides support to around 24 restaurants owned by, among others, Batali and Joe Bastianich — in October 2017, a B&B restaurant employee officially reported inappropriate behavior by Batali to the company. It was the first formal complaint about Batali, who was reprimanded and required to undergo training, according to the company. In a statement to Eater, Batali said that he is stepping away from the day-to-day operations of his businesses for an unspecified period of time. ABC, where Batali has co-hosted the daytime show The Chew since 2011, has also asked the chef to step away from the show “while we review the allegations that have just recently come to our attention,” a spokesperson said. Batali did not deny all the allegations, saying that they “match up” with ways he has behaved. “I apologize to the people I have mistreated and hurt. Although the identities of most of the individuals mentioned in these stories have not been revealed to me, much of the behavior described does, in fact, match up with ways I have acted. That behavior was wrong and there are no excuses. I take full responsibility and am deeply sorry for any pain, humiliation or discomfort I have caused to my peers, employees, customers, friends and family. “I have work to do to try to regain the trust of those I have hurt and disappointed. For this reason, I am going to step away from day-to-day operations of my businesses. We built these restaurants so that our guests could have fun and indulge, but I took that too far in my own behavior. I won’t make that mistake again. I want any place I am associated with to feel comfortable and safe for the people who work or dine there. ""I know my actions have disappointed many people. The successes I have enjoyed are owned by everyone on my team. The failures are mine alone. To the people who have been at my side during this time — my family, my partners, my employees, my friends, my fans — I am grateful for your support and hopeful that I can regain your respect and trust.

As a chef, she was excited to meet one of the most revered figures in the restaurant industry. When they started talking, she recalls, she realized that he’d been drinking and he became what she characterized as “creepy” — “just giving me this provocative, icky feeling.” Minutes into their conversation, she recalls, he told her, “Come work for me, I’ll pay you double what you’re making.” Moments later, someone bumped her glass, spilling wine all over her chest and down her scooped-neck shirt. She alleges that Batali began rubbing her breasts with his bare hands while saying something like, “Let me help you with that,” as he groped her chest. “He just went to town, and I was so shocked,” the chef says. “Jaw on the ground, I just stepped back from him in utter disgust and walked away.” The chef is one of four women who allege that Batali touched them inappropriately in a pattern of behavior that appears to span at least two decades. Three of the women worked for Batali in some capacity during their careers. One former employee alleges that over the course of two years, he repeatedly grabbed her from behind and held her tightly against his body. Another former employee alleges that he groped her and that, in a separate incident, he compelled her to straddle him; another alleges that he grabbed her breasts at a party, though she no longer worked for him at the time. The woman whose allegations are described above has never worked for Batali, though she works in the restaurant industry. Batali was reprimanded for inappropriate behavior in the workplace as recently as two months ago. According to a spokesperson for Batali & Bastianich Hospitality Group — the restaurant-management services company that provides support to around 24 restaurants owned by, among others, Batali and Joe Bastianich — in October 2017, a B&B restaurant employee officially reported inappropriate behavior by Batali to the company. It was the first formal complaint about Batali, who was reprimanded and required to undergo training, according to the company. In a statement to Eater, Batali said that he is stepping away from the day-to-day operations of his businesses for an unspecified period of time. ABC, where Batali has co-hosted the daytime show The Chew since 2011, has also asked the chef to step away from the show “while we review the allegations that have just recently come to our attention,” a spokesperson said. Batali did not deny all the allegations, saying that they “match up” with ways he has behaved. “I apologize to the people I have mistreated and hurt. Although the identities of most of the individuals mentioned in these stories have not been revealed to me, much of the behavior described does, in fact, match up with ways I have acted. That behavior was wrong and there are no excuses. I take full responsibility and am deeply sorry for any pain, humiliation or discomfort I have caused to my peers, employees, customers, friends and family. “I have work to do to try to regain the trust of those I have hurt and disappointed. For this reason, I am going to step away from day-to-day operations of my businesses. We built these restaurants so that our guests could have fun and indulge, but I took that too far in my own behavior. I won’t make that mistake again. I want any place I am associated with to feel comfortable and safe for the people who work or dine there. ""I know my actions have disappointed many people. The successes I have enjoyed are owned by everyone on my team. The failures are mine alone. To the people who have been at my side during this time — my family, my partners, my employees, my friends, my fans — I am grateful for your support and hopeful that I can regain your respect and trust. I will spend the next period of time trying to do that.” Batali remains an owner of his individual restaurants, according to the B&B spokesperson. In a statement to Eater, B&B said that while the company has had sexual harassment training and policies for more than 10 years, it will now also enlist an independent, outside corporate investigations firm for any staffers wishing to make claims against owners of the restaurants. “We take these allegations very seriously. We pride ourselves on being a workplace for our employees where they can grow and deliver great service with equal opportunity and free from any discrimination. We have strong policies and practices in place that address sexual harassment. We train employees in these policies and we enforce them, up to and including termination,” B&B’s statement reads in part. “Mr. Batali and we have agreed that he will step away from the company’s operations, including the restaurants, and has already done so.” Joe Bastianich said in a statement, “Right now, I’m just focused on ensuring that our more than 1,000 employees continue to have a safe and positive work environment.” An ABC spokesperson said in a statement, “ABC takes matters like this very seriously as we are committed to a safe work environment. While we are unaware of any type of inappropriate behavior involving him and anyone affiliated with the show, we will swiftly address any alleged violations of our standards of conduct.” Although B&B has been sued for sexual harassment before, Batali’s own alleged inappropriate sexual misconduct has not previously been the subject of a lawsuit. Each of the women who spoke to Eater asked to remain anonymous in part for fear of retaliation — Batali, a celebrated and powerful chef, holds enormous sway in the restaurant world and beyond. Eater is granting them anonymity but has corroborated their stories with friends, family members, or colleagues who were informed of the incidents, as well as with"

The comedian has mercilessly jabbed at the president since the campaign trail, honing his voice as David Letterman’s replacement on The Late Show with Trump as his perennial punching bag. (He even got him to respond once.) So on Sunday night, as he approached the lectern to kick off the 2017 Emmy Awards gala, Colbert naturally used his platform to rip the president. There was one surprise, however: a guest appearance by Sean Spicer.  For his opening act, Colbert did a song-and-dance number running through various shows up for Emmys this year, including This Is Us, Stranger Things, and The Handmaid’s Tale.

After that, however, he didn’t take long to get to the Trump jokes: “If he had won an Emmy,” Colbert quipped, “I bet he never would have run for president. So in a way, this is your fault.

gossipcop-853236,"Matthew James Morrison (born October 30, 1978)[1] is an American actor, dancer, and singer-songwriter. Morrison is known for starring in multiple Broadway and Off-Broadway productions, including his portrayal of Link Larkin in Hairspray on Broadway, and for his role as Will Schuester on the Fox television show Glee (2009–2015). Morrison is signed with Adam Levine's 222 Records. Morrison received a Tony Award nomination for his featured role as Fabrizio Nacarelli in the musical The Light in the Piazza. From March 2015 to January 2016, Morrison starred in the lead role of J.M. Barrie in the Broadway production of Finding Neverland. Early life [ edit ] Morrison was born in Fort Ord, California, the son of Mary Louise (Fraser) and Thomas Morrison.[2] Morrison was raised in Chico, California, and has Scottish and English ancestry.[3][4] He was part of the Collaborative Arts Project 21 (CAP21) and the Orange County High School of the Arts, while at the Los Alamitos High School campus. While in high school, Morrison did a musical with actress Jodie Sweetin. He attended New York University's Tisch School of the Arts for two years before dropping out and joining the Broadway adaptation of Footloose.[5] By freshman year of college, Morrison already was a regular performer on Broadway. He said in Details, ""There were all these beautiful, beautiful dancers. As a straight guy I had some room. There were the shared interests in singing and dancing, and I always find dancing with someone very erotic and sexual. I definitely hooked up with a lot of girls when I was a young guy on Broadway.""[6] Career [ edit ] Morrison's career began when he made his musical theatre debut on Broadway in the musical version of Footloose, followed by a revival of The Rocky Horror Show in 2002. Morrison's big break came, however, when Morrison landed the role of Link Larkin in the Broadway production of John Waters', Hairspray. After performing in the role for some time, Morrison started working in television, guest-starring on shows such as Ghost Whisperer, Numb3rs, CSI: Miami and Hack. Morrison also had small roles in films such as Marci X, Primary Colors, Music and Lyrics, and Simply Funk. Morrison followed up these performances by performing the role of Sir Harry in the ABC-TV production of Once Upon a Mattress, starring Tracey Ullman, Zooey Deschanel and Carol Burnett. In 2001, Morrison was recruited to complete the quartet for the band LMNT. Morrison was replaced instead by Jonas Persch by the time its first album was released. Morrison commented in an interview about his experience in the boy band by remarking, ""It was the worst year of my life. You know when you're a performer and you're out there on stage and you're embarrassed that you're doing something wrong. It was pretty bad.""

As Gossip Cop reported, Blige filed for divorce from Isaacs, her husband and manager, last July. The couple split after 12 years of marriage.",1,en,"Mary J. Blige says she was hacked and was not the person who tweeted a hateful message about estranged husband, Martin “Kendu” Isaacs.","Mary J. Blige Denies Tweeting Hateful Message Amidst Hacking Incident

Renowned artist and Grammy Award-winning singer, Mary J. Blige, has come forward to categorically deny her involvement in a recent tweet that spewed animosity towards her estranged husband, Martin “Kendu” Isaacs. Blige claims that her online presence was compromised, leaving her a victim of hacking and subsequent defamation.

In a shocking turn of events, the R&B icon found herself at the center of a firestorm on social media after a now-deleted tweet directed derogatory words towards Isaacs, with whom she is currently going through a tumultuous divorce. The tweet, which quickly garnered widespread attention and sparked controversy, suggested a level of vitriol entirely out of character for Blige.

Stepping forward to address the matter, Blige's representatives have since released a statement asserting her innocence and providing details of the hacking incident. They confirmed that the singer's personal Twitter account had been infiltrated by cybercriminals who maliciously used her influential platform to spread malicious content. This, undoubtedly, led to the dissemination of the hateful message, wrongly attributed to Blige herself.

According to her publicist, Blige was alerted to the tweet by concerned fans and immediately took action to regain control of her account. In an era where social media platforms are increasingly targeted by hackers, this incident serves as a stark reminder of the vulnerability we all face in the digital world.

The team behind Blige believes this abhorrent act was a deliberate attempt to tarnish her reputation, exploit her personal hardships, and create discord at a time when she is already navigating a very private and challenging divorce. Further investigations are being conducted to ascertain the identity of the culprits behind this heinous cybercrime.

In the meantime, Mary J. Blige remains determined to focus her energy on the positive aspects of her life and career, promising her loyal fans that she will not let this unfortunate event overshadow her journey. Conveying her deepest appreciation for the overwhelming support she has received, Blige is resolute in her belief that truth will prevail, asserting her unshakeable commitment to maintaining a legacy of strength and unwavering resilience.

As the investigation unfolds, the incident serves as a stark reminder of the importance of secure online practices and the ever-increasing threat of cyberattacks targeting both celebrities and everyday individuals. The consequences of such breaches are far-reaching; they cannot only destroy one's personal reputation but also sow seeds of division and hostility among loved ones.

We stand with Mary J. Blige during this distressing time, cognizant that her role as a prominent figure in the entertainment industry continues to inspire countless individuals around the world. Only through thorough investigations and relentless pursuit of justice can we hope to guard against future intrusions, ensuring that the virtual spaces we occupy remain sanctuaries free of hate, manipulation, and deceit."

The Pistons will send forward Tobias Harris, guard Avery Bradley and center Boban Marjanovic to Los Angeles, with the Clippers also receiving draft picks.

In a shocking trade move, the injury-prone Griffin has been traded to the Detroit Pistons on Monday, raising concerns about his future and fueling speculation about a possible connection to a notorious celebrity family.

Blake Griffin's journey in professional basketball has been nothing short of captivating. His explosive dunks, remarkable athleticism, and leadership qualities have earned him respect and admiration throughout the league. However, recurring injuries have cast a cloud of uncertainty over his trajectory in recent years, leaving fans and analysts to question if he could ever reclaim his former glory.

In an unforeseen twist, the Los Angeles Clippers traded their cornerstone player to the Pistons, a decision that has sent shockwaves through the NBA community. With Detroit's acquisition of Griffin, a player who boasts formidable talent when healthy, the Pistons have expressed their belief in his ability to reignite their franchise and lead them towards a prosperous future.

Nevertheless, some have drawn a correlation between Griffin's career decline and his alleged ties to a certain celebrity family. While the accuracy and validity of these claims remain unconfirmed, there is no denying that his relationship with the public eye has been under constant scrutiny. Whether it be the alleged distractions or the burden of expectations that come with his associations, critics argue that Blake Griffin's downfall could be linked to the relentless media attention he has faced.

In light of these latest developments, it is imperative to understand that Griffin's legacy should be judged solely on his basketball prowess and undeniable talent. We must resist the temptation to indulge in speculative narratives that sensationalize his personal life and instead focus on his contributions to the sport.

As Blake Griffin begins this new chapter in his career donning a Pistons jersey, there is an undeniable sense of anticipation for what the future holds. Detroit has placed a considerable bet on Griffin's ability to stay healthy and lead their team to new heights. In return, the power forward must overcome his injury-plagued past and prove that he is still an elite player capable of dominating the court.

Only time will tell if Blake Griffin's move to Detroit will ultimately define a reinvigorated chapter in his career or solidify a decline influenced by circumstances beyond his control. As fans, we must stand united in giving Griffin the fair chance he deserves, free from the distractions and conjecture surrounding his personal life. The destiny of this talented player lies in his own hands, his resilience, and his unwavering dedication to the game that has brought him this far."

In a shocking turn of events, Hollywood A-lister Angelina Jolie seems to be contemplating a jaw-dropping move that has left fans and analysts baffled. After calling for a divorce from her long-time partner Brad Pitt, sources close to the actress have revealed exclusively to our publication that there may be a glimmer of hope for a reconciled relationship. Whispers abound that Jolie would consider welcoming Pitt back into her life with open arms, albeit for one compelling reason.

The 45-year-old actress, renowned for her charitable endeavors and influential roles, had been at the center of media scrutiny ever since news of their high-profile divorce first broke in 2016. Their relationship had been under relentless observation, admired by many as the epitome of glamour and star power. As speculations mounted, the world watched, intrigued by what could have caused the demise of such an enviable union.

However, our trusted sources have now highlighted that Jolie, despite the seemingly insurmountable differences she once faced with the distinguished actor and philanthropist, may consider rescinding her divorce petition. The question on everyone's lips remains; what could inspire Angelina Jolie to potentially reunite with Brad Pitt?

While details surrounding their alleged discussions have been veiled in secrecy, it is speculated that the couple's unwavering commitment to their children's wellbeing stands at the forefront of this potential reconciliation. Ever since their tumultuous parting, Jolie, a devoted mother of six, has acknowledged Pitt's deep-rooted love and involvement in their children's lives. This revelation has apparently led to a change of heart within the Academy Award-winning actress.

It is no secret that Jolie and Pitt's journey as parents has been the subject of great speculation, with their shared custody battles oscillating in public discourse. However, our sources suggest that Jolie's change of heart lies in the undeniable bond she observes between Pitt and their children. The notion of safeguarding the familial stability that her children require, and Pitt's evident dedication to their upbringing, has sparked a contemplation that has shaken both Jolie herself and her inner circle.

As Hollywood's golden couple, viewed for years as an unstoppable force in the industry, the potential for their love story to be reignited has already captured the collective imagination of fans worldwide. A reunion, driven by sincere parental love, could potentially usher in a fresh era of unity, forgiveness, and growth; not just for the family but for their legions of loyal admirers as well.

However, it must be noted that the decision still hangs precariously in the balance. Neither Jolie nor Pitt have addressed these rumors publicly, leaving the world in anticipation of an official confirmation or denial of their potential reunion.

As the world yearns for more substantial information, it is essential to remember that matters of the heart hold an incomparable complexity. Only time will unveil whether Angelina Jolie, the esteemed actress who captured our hearts, is prepared to embrace a newfound chapter with Brad Pitt, amidst a background of past heartaches and future possibilities."

Renowned hip-hop music star, Chris Brown, has raised eyebrows with an audacious idea that he himself admits might seem a little outlandish. Taking to Twitter on Friday, Brown directed his 26.7 million followers' attention towards a proposal of epic proportions: a global tour showcasing not just his own talents, but also those of three of the greatest names the music industry has ever seen.

In a series of tweets, the Grammy-winning artist unveiled his vision to unite himself with three heavyweight icons, setting the stage for a concert experience like no other. With a flamboyance that characterizes Brown's own unique style, he expressed his burning desire to collaborate with these superstars on what can only be described as a monumental endeavor.

While Brown, often an enigmatic figure to many, carefully avoided mentioning any specific artists by name, his followers were left to wonder which musical titans he had in mind. Speculations are already rampant within the industry, but no official confirmation has been made regarding who these mystery collaborators might be.

Nevertheless, fans and enthusiasts from around the globe were quick to catch onto the artist's vision, responding with an overwhelming wave of excitement and support. Social media platforms have been inundated with Brown's proposal, with fans relentlessly tagging their favorite artists, fervently hoping to be part of this groundbreaking extravaganza.

The idea, although unorthodox, has been hailed by some as a stroke of genius, tapping into a collective hunger for new and exhilarating experiences. By bringing together artists of such unparalleled magnitude, Brown aims to captivate audiences beyond anyone's imagination, thrusting them into a realm where dreams seamlessly intertwine with reality.

Industry experts have praised Brown for his ambition and unwavering dedication to pushing boundaries, as this concept challenges the very essence of conventional concerts. Should this audacious plan become a reality, audiences worldwide are likely to witness an unprecedented display of musical virtuosity that transcends the limits of genre, ethnicity, and generation.

Responses from the potential collaborators themselves remain elusive at this stage, leaving fans hanging in suspense. As anticipation builds and the industry buzzes with speculation, the world watches the unfolding drama, eagerly awaiting official announcements that will put the pieces of this musical puzzle together.

For now, the possibility of a global tour showcasing Chris Brown, alongside three of the most revered names in the music industry, hangs tantalizingly on the horizon. As fans and industry insiders hold their breath, the question on everyone's lips remains: Who will join forces with Brown on this awe-inspiring journey, forever etched into the annals of musical history?"

When asked by Morgan if there will ever be more Sex and the City, Cattral said, “Not for me. That was part of turning 60. That was a very clear moment of how many years do I have left and what do I want to do with it? What haven’t I done? I feel that the show was the best when it was the series and the bonus was the two movies.”",1,en,"October 2017 During an interview with Piers Morgan, Cattrall says she will not do another Sex and the City movie and that she was never really friends with her Sex and the City co-stars.","October 2017 - In an unexpected revelation during an exclusive interview with renowned television personality Piers Morgan, the iconic actress Kim Cattrall confirmed her unequivocal decision to abstain from participating in any future production of the beloved movie franchise, Sex and the City. Furthermore, Cattrall made a striking statement regarding her relationship with her former co-stars, expressing that their on-screen camaraderie did not extend to off-screen friendships.

During the candid conversation, which delved into Cattrall's perspective on her career and personal life, the actress left no room for speculation, stating firmly that she had closed the chapter on any potential future Sex and the City projects. Cattrall's decision leaves fans worldwide in deep contemplation and eager to unravel the motivations behind her surprise announcement.

The Sex and the City franchise, which captivated audiences across the globe with its glamour, wit, and relatability, held a special place in the hearts of loyal viewers. Cattrall's portrayal of the vivacious and audacious Samantha Jones helped shape the character's lasting influence and contributed significantly to the series' unrivaled success.

However, as fans reminisce on the cherished memories created by the iconic foursome on-screen, Kim Cattrall's revelation unveils a different dynamic that existed behind the scenes. Contrary to the perception that these esteemed actors shared a deep, enduring bond off-camera, Cattrall unveiled the often-hidden truth and conveyed that their connection was limited strictly to the realm of professionalism.

Cattrall's candid confession touched a nerve for ardent supporters of Sex and the City, as they grapple with the realization that the relationships they cherished were perhaps not as genuine as they had imagined. The idea that the camaraderie displayed on screen may have been nothing more than remarkable acting prowess has left loyal fans yearning for answers and an understanding of the authentic nature of the sextet's relationship.

This revelation not only sheds light on the intricate dynamics within the entertainment industry but also emphasizes the divergent paths that can develop between co-stars, even when engrossed in a collective project for numerous years. In a world where television shows and films often create a sense of closeness and familiarity among actors, Cattrall's honesty serves as a enlightening reminder that the boundaries between fiction and reality can occasionally blur.

As fans and industry insiders absorb this unexpected announcement, it remains to be seen how the decision of Kim Cattrall's refusal to partake in any future Sex and the City movies will impact the franchise's future. With the prominent absence of Samantha Jones, the influential character embodied unequivocally by Cattrall, questions arise as to whether the series' unique essence can ever be effectively recreated.

Be it the mark left by Kim Cattrall's unforgettable performance or the revelation regarding the true nature of the friendships formed on set, this unexpected twist in the Sex and the City saga reverberates as a poignant reminder of the complexity that can lie beneath the surface of even the most apparently cohesive and amicable collectives."

New Idea claims that the Legally Blonde star is unhappy with her Australian, Big Little Lies co-star’s failure to promote the HBO series in the run-up to its debut in February, claiming that Nicole used too much of her airtime to discuss her latest Hollywood hit, Lion.  “Reese is furious that Nicole hasn’t done more to support Big Little Lies. All she talked about in the interviews was Lion. Had Reese known that Nicole would put the show so far on the back-burner, she would have cast some random person in the show,” Daily Mail quoted a source as saying.  Red carpet roundup: Golden girls at Oscars 2017  In Australia, Big Little Lies‘ debut outranked any HBO series broadcast on Foxtel in a launch week, more than doubling the audience that tuned in to see Game of Thrones‘ first-ever episode.  But New Idea suggests that it’s the underwhelming reception in her own home country that has left Reese disappointed. Reese is one of the executive producers for the show after all.  According to the publication, frosty relations between the pair manifested themselves at the Oscars last month. “You could cut the tension with a knife at the Oscars. Nicole was telling her people to keep Reese away from her,” claimed the source.  News of the pair being involved in “some tense arguments” during filming were also reported by the publication, which alleged that the Hollywood heavyweights may never work together again.  An insider claimed, “If the show doesn’t make any waves or get better ratings, it will probably mark the end of Reese and Nicole’s joint ventures.”  However, a representative of Daily Mail Australia says the story is completely incorrect. “Everyone is thrilled to the back teeth with Big Little Lies. They’re (Reese and Nicole) great friends, they love each other and they love the way each other works.”  Another source has denied New Idea’s claims that Nicole had not been promoting the show as much as fellow cast members, saying that the 49-year-old did a ‘shed load’ of publicity both in America and abroad. The report comes just two months after she spoke about the actresses’ friendship in California. “We’re very, very close friends. We’re able to talk about everything,” she said.

The claims made by New Idea have ignited a wave of speculation and raised eyebrows within the entertainment industry. Witherspoon's fans, in particular, have voiced their concerns as they eagerly anticipate the release of Big Little Lies, eagerly hoping for an extraordinary performance from the talented star.

Now that we know that the show's final words were (major spoiler alert) Rory saying ""I'm pregnant,"" the question of who Rory's baby's father is has left many fans freaking out, especially considering that the words have always been described as final, meaning the mystery might remain unsolved forever. To make matters even worse? One of Gilmore Girls' lead actors, Matt Czuchry, knows the answer — but he's not going to tell you it anytime soon.  In an interview with The Huffington Post published on Friday, Czuchry (who plays Logan Huntzberger) revealed that he and the show's creators, Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino, know who the father of Rory's child is. ""[Amy and Dan] did tell me who is the father of that baby,” Czuchry revealed. “If they ever want to reveal that, they can do that, but I think at this particular point, I think the purpose is ... to fast forward and say, what kind of mother would Rory be, what kind of grandmother would Lorelai be [and] in terms of whoever the father is would they be in that person’s life. Would it be different from Christopher or would it mirror that completely? Those stories aren’t told yet. I think the fun is for everybody to come up with those theories and play that out in their minds.”  BUILD Series on YouTube  Come on. That's too tantalizing, but alas, Czuchry is smart not to tell us the truth. Still, Palladino and Sherman-Palladino have addressed the final four words and the ambiguousness of the ending themselves before, and whether Rory will become a parent at all is less definite than Czuchry makes it sound. Sherman-Palladino has mentioned that Rory would consider an abortion, and in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Palladino revealed that neither creator had a clear idea of Rory's future.

Whatever happens, fans will be waiting eagerly to find out.  Image: Netflix",0,en,0,"The much-talked about ending of the Gilmore Girls revival left many perplexed, some vexed, and pretty much everyone wanting the mystery to be solved ASAP. Now that we know that the show's final words were (major spoiler alert) Rory saying ""I'm pregnant,"" the question of who Rory's baby's father is has left many fans freaking out, especially considering that the words have always been described as final, meaning the mystery might remain unsolved forever. To make matters even worse? One of Gilmore Girls' lead actors, Matt Czuchry, knows the answer — but he's not going to tell you it anytime soon.  In an interview with The Huffington Post published on Friday, Czuchry (who plays Logan Huntzberger) revealed that he and the show's creators, Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino, know who the father of Rory's child is. ""[Amy and Dan] did tell me who is the father of that baby,” Czuchry revealed. “If they ever want to reveal that, they can do that, but I think at this particular point, I think the purpose is ... to fast forward and say, what kind of mother would Rory be, what kind of grandmother would Lorelai be [and] in terms of whoever the father is would they be in that person’s life. Would it be different from Christopher or would it mirror that completely? Those stories aren’t told yet. I think the fun is for everybody to come up with those theories and play that out in their minds.”  BUILD Series on YouTube  Come on. That's too tantalizing, but alas, Czuchry is smart not to tell us the truth. Still, Palladino and Sherman-Palladino have addressed the final four words and the ambiguousness of the ending themselves before, and whether Rory will become a parent at all is less definite than Czuchry makes it sound. Sherman-Palladino has mentioned that Rory would consider an abortion, and in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Palladino revealed that neither creator had a clear idea of Rory's future.

He shared a photo from Sophie and Joe’s engagement party in Nov. 2017, and captioned the pic that also included Kevin and Frankie Jonas, “Happy Birthday @sophiet You’re super cool! We all think so!” Aww, it’s like she’s already part of the family!  You can also bet that the Game Of Thrones star wouldn’t mind her fiancé posing for photos with a bunch of beauties on the beach. On her birthday, Sophie posted a video to her Instagram story jamming out to “22” by Taylor Swift (as any self-respecting 22-year-old would do on their birthday). As you may remember, Tay and Joe used to be a ~thing~ back in 2008. But clearly, that doesn’t phase the X-Men: Apocalypse star in the slightest — nor should it. Taylor has her own Joe (Alwyn) now, and the Josie star has made it clear there’s no bad blood between them. She even came to the singer’s defense when people on Twitter questioned her inclusion in TIME‘s Person of the Year issue in December. Basically Sophie is the best, and we’re sure Joe knows that!

In a recent escapade that has captured the attention of international media, Joe Jonas, the talented American musician and heartthrob, has been caught delighting in the warm embrace of Australia's sun-soaked shores. However, what was conspicuously amiss from the star-studded affair was his beloved wife, actress Sophie Turner.

Venturing far from the bustling streets of Los Angeles, Joe Jonas, accompanied by a group of captivating women, ventured into the captivating landscapes of Australia to escape the pressures of fame and bask in the immensity of nature's splendor.

I have let my insecurities get the best of me at times, I let my broken relationships dictate the way I acted toward people and the way I treated them.

Since 1999 there have been more than 55 published articles about her being pregnant both in and outside the U.S. It was even reported by the Huffington Post that despite the possibility that the U.S would go into war “Jennifer Aniston Pregnant” was still searched more than “are we at war” on Google.  Jennifer did express in early interviews that she wanted to become a mother one day and from then on the world was waiting. The obsession with her character on Friends—and the fact that Rachel did get pregnant—could be the reason why fans kept a close eye on is she or isn’t she in real life. In fact, the roles Jennifer took on in her career often had a direct impact on when and how her pregnancy rumors evolved.

Introduction:
In a world where societal expectations often dictate the trajectory of one's life, it comes as no surprise that the decision to have children can be accompanied by profound pressures. While most individuals face subtle nudges from friends and family to embrace parenthood, the plight of celebrities reaches a whole new level, with the entire world rigorously scrutinizing their every move. However, pushing back against this relentless global pressure, a growing number of prominent figures are courageously speaking up about their personal choices, emphasizing that not all women want to have children, and reassessing society's preconceived notions of normalcy.

Body:
Within the realm of public figures, celebrities find themselves confronting unprecedented scrutiny, often being subject to intrusive commentary on their decisions regarding parenthood. Yet, an empowering shift is taking place, challenging archaic ideals that prematurely claim motherhood as a universal goal. A diverse cohort of influential women, including actresses, musicians, and public figures, are bravely sharing their stories to debunk the myth that all females are instinctively and unconditionally obliged to become mothers.

Among those who have joined this transformative discourse is award-winning actress, Emma Thompson. The beloved British talent, recognized for her remarkable performances on the silver screen, recently revealed her choice to remain childless. Thompson, an advocate for female empowerment, argues that motherhood should not be viewed as an obligatory act, but rather as a deeply personal decision that merits respect and understanding.

International pop-star, Rihanna, has also been an outspoken advocate for women's autonomy over their reproductive choices. Despite her global success and admiration, the Barbadian artist has faced relentless inquiries about her maternity plans. Resolute in her prioritization of career aspirations and personal fulfillment, Rihanna's refusal to be defined solely by motherhood represents a potentially paradigm-shifting stance, encouraging others to view women through a more inclusive lens.

Scientists and psychologists also highlight the significance of these narratives, affirming that not all women inherently desire to bear children. Citing numerous studies, experts assert that societal expectations which adhere to heterosexual norms and traditional gender roles have often overshadowed the diverse range of choices that women may consider, suppressing alternative pathways to happiness and fulfillment.

Conclusion:
The emergence of these inspirational voices within the realm of celebrity signifies a pivotal moment in reshaping societal attitudes towards maternity and empowering women to embrace their authentic desires. As courageous figures from various walks of life shed light on the complexity and personal nature of the decision to have children, a long-overdue universal acceptance of personal choices begins to take root. It is imperative that we continue to shift societal expectations, dismantling the pressure faced by both ordinary individuals and celebrities alike, so that all women may confidently live their lives in accordance with their own values, aspirations, and desires."

In an attempt to set an optimistic tone and rally support for his administration, President Trump delivered his first State of the Union address on Tuesday night. Despite his efforts, the President's speech garnered strong reactions and sparked intense debate amongst celebrities on the notorious battleground of Twitter.

President Trump, known for his unapologetic and unconventional approach to communication, aimed to address his nation with a message of hope, highlighting several achievements accomplished during his highly polarizing term. The President's speech touched on topics such as the economy, national security, immigration, and healthcare, aiming to outline his administration's vision and priorities moving forward.

While President Trump aimed to strike a conciliatory tone, his words stirred a storm of emotions, especially among celebrities who have often used the platform to voice their criticism. Hollywood elites and public figures turned to their Twitter accounts, expressing both praise and disdain for the President's rhetoric.

Prominent personalities took advantage of this high-profile event to express their contrasting opinions. A barrage of tweets flowed in from outspoken figures, both hailing the President's achievements and challenging his policies. With millions of followers, these celebrities have become influential voices in shaping public opinion.

Celebrities' reactions ranged from jubilation and gratitude for the President's accomplishments, lauding his economic policies and job creation, to passionate critiques over his approach to social issues, immigration reform, and climate change.

The President's supporters commended his unwavering commitment to bolstering the American economy, citing record-low unemployment rates, the stock market's success, and the historic tax reform bill as game-changing milestones that have invigorated the nation.

Meanwhile, voices of discontent resounded through Twitter as celebrities decried President Trump's stance on immigration and his administration's controversial policies, arguing that they foster divisiveness and undermine the country's moral values.

The social media frenzy following the State of the Union address highlighted the deep divisions within American society, with passionate discussions unfolding online. Supporters and critics alike engaged in animated exchanges as they defended their respective perspectives, exacerbating the country's already tense political climate.

Once again, President Trump's unconventional style, penchant for controversy, and ability to stir intense reactions have dominated the national conversation. As the country enters another year of his administration, the divide in opinion has become even more entrenched, setting the stage for a dramatic and contentious political landscape.

Only time will tell whether the online debates and debates within the hallowed halls of Congress will translate into meaningful dialogue and action, or simply contribute to the increasing polarization that has become emblematic of present-day America. For now, the reaction to President Trump's State of the Union address serves as a poignant reminder of the challenges faced in uniting a nation deeply divided."

In a surprising turn of events, reality TV star and influential businesswoman Kim Kardashian recently engaged in a thought-provoking dialogue with United States President Donald Trump at the White House. The purpose of this remarkable meeting was to discuss an issue of utmost importance to Kardashian: prison reforms.

Known primarily for her entertainment empire and personal branding, Kardashian has emerged as an unexpected and influential figure in the realm of criminal justice reform in recent years. Her notable efforts to raise awareness about the unjust sentencing of nonviolent offenders and advocate for their rights have captured the attention of both the public and high-ranking political figures alike.

During her meeting with the President, Kardashian passionately addressed the urgent need for procedural changes within the US penal system. Recognizing her undeniable influence and reach, she passionately argued for a more compassionate approach to incarceration, emphasizing the importance of second chances and the devastating impact that over-sentencing can have on individuals, families, and society as a whole.

The high-profile encounter between Kardashian and Trump marks a significant moment in the ongoing discussions surrounding justice reform. While critics may contend that this extraordinary meeting is merely a political spectacle, it is crucial to recognize the value of celebrities using their platforms responsibly and constructively to bring about meaningful change.

With her unique ability to captivate the public's attention, Kardashian has effectively utilized her influence to amplify the voices of those marginalized by an outdated justice system. Moreover, her meeting with the President demonstrates a growing recognition within the highest echelons of power of the pressing need for comprehensive prison reforms.

While the details of the meeting remain undisclosed, sources close to the discussions suggest that both Kardashian and Trump showed a genuine willingness to explore innovative solutions that could address the inherent flaws within the current prison system. The fact that these two distinctly different personalities could come together and engage in a constructive dialogue is indicative of the urgency and importance of this issue.

Experts agree that the involvement of high-profile figures such as Kardashian is an invaluable asset for the criminal justice reform movement and could catalyze transformative changes within the system. As she continues to leverage her influence, it remains to be seen how her involvement in the cause will unfold in the months and years ahead.

In a world characterized by polarizing views and a seemingly insurmountable undertow of cynicism, it is refreshing to witness a prominent figure like Kardashian taking a stand on such a contentious and sensitive topic. Her advocacy for prison reforms is a testament to the power of individual voices, even those originating from the world of entertainment.

As the public eagerly awaits further updates on the outcome of this landmark meeting, it is becoming increasingly clear that Kardashian's determination to effect change is neither fleeting nor superficial. With her unwavering commitment to this cause, she has positioned herself as an unquestionably influential force in the movement for criminal justice reform, leaving a lasting impact on America's collective consciousness."

Five figures is a huge expense for a one-day affair. That is, unless you're ultra-rich — and especially if you're royalty rich.  Next month, the world will bear witness to the most anticipated royal wedding in years. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are set to be married on May 19 at St. George's Chapel, in Windsor, and will begin a carriage procession immediately after the ceremony. Their reception will take place later on the grounds of Windsor Castle.  Kensington Palace will cover the cost of the wedding, an expense traditionally taken on by the bride's family.  The case was the same for Kate Middleton and Prince William's 2011 royal wedding— the only item Middleton paid for was her six-figure Alexander McQueen dress. Their total wedding celebration cost $34 million (£23.7 million).  Markle and Prince Harry's wedding will reportedly cost in excess of $45.8 million (£32 million), according to Bride Book's estimation. That's over 1,000 more than the average wedding.  The venue is the biggest part of a typical wedding budget for couples in the US and the UK, taking up nearly half of the entire wedding cost. Access to St. George's Chapel — and St. George's Great Hall, where the wedding reception will take place — is free of charge for Markle and Prince Harry. Transportation is also free, thanks to the Queen's fleet of Rolls-Royces, Daimlers, and Bentleys.  The greatest cost for the royal couple? Security. Protecting Markle and Prince Harry, plus thousands of guests and onlookers, will run Kensington Palace a whopping $43 million (£30 million), estimates Bride Book. That includes the cost of snipers, undercover police, military technology, and security drones. The bulk of Kate Middleton and Prince William's wedding budget similarly went to security costs.  Otherwise, Markle and Prince Harry's total wedding spend, including food, cakes, entertainment, wardrobe, and the honeymoon, amounts to about $2.8 million.

Gomez’s rekindled friendship with Justin Bieber, however, had nothing to do with the rapper’s decision to end his romance with the singer.  As Gossip Cop reported, Gomez and The Weeknd recently split after nearly a year of dating. The pair weren’t seen together much during the summer, though it was later revealed the singer-actress was laying low due to a kidney transplant. Regardless, they still appeared to be going strong in the early fall. Prior to the announcement of their breakup, the status of their relationship was questioned after it emerged Gomez had rekindled her friendship with Bieber. © Gossip Cop (Getty Images)  On Sunday, that speculation swirled as Bieber and Gomez were seen in public and The Weeknd stopped following her friends on social media. That being said, Bieber was allegedly not responsible for the breakup. Rather, it was the challenges of a long-distance relationship, particularly with The Weeknd touring and Gomez’s shooting schedule, that led both the former couple to reconsider their fizzling relationship.  Additionally, contributing to their split, the rapper felt “tied down” in a relationship that had lost its spark. Over time, the pair started talking less frequently on the phone, prompting The Weeknd to end his romance with Gomez, reports TMZ. Despite their breakup, we’re told that the pair are still on good terms and have talked several times since the split.  Predictably, after the rapper ended his relationship with Gomez, Gossip Cop busted the often disproven HollywoodLife for claiming in a made-up report that The Weeknd was “heartbroken” over Gomez reconnecting with Bieber. In the bogus story, the bad blog ridiculously asserted that The Weeknd and Gomez were caught in a “love triangle” with Bieber, but of course, the breakup had nothing to do with and wasn’t caused by the “Love Yourself” singer.

In our unwavering pursuit of truth, Gossip Cop can confirm these distressing reports. Although Gomez's recently rekindled friendship with Justin Bieber has been subject to intense scrutiny, it is essential to stress that this connection bears no responsibility for the demise of her passionate love affair with the renowned rapper.

A clandestine source revealed that The Weeknd's decision to end his romance with Gomez stemmed from personal and introspective reasons, far removed from the rumor mill's insistent claims. With an ardent commitment to delivering accurate information, Gossip Cop has rigorously investigated these details to provide our readers with an unbiased truth, free from speculation or hearsay.

Since their highly publicized and seemingly blissful union, fans had always hoped for the couple to withstand the pressures of the spotlight. However, amidst the glare of the media's unwavering gaze, true hearts can falter and relationships can fray. Although their connection appeared to be a match for the ages, The Weeknd's unanticipated decision has irrevocably shattered the dreams of countless admirers.

In recent times, whispers of a renewed bond between Gomez, the former Disney starlet, and pop sensation Justin Bieber had ignited speculation, placing expectations squarely upon the shoulders of those involved. While societal narratives often predispose hearts to wander at the first sign of weakness, Gossip Cop can emphatically assert that it is unjust to attribute blame to Gomez's renewed friendship as a catalyst for the disintegration of her fervent love with The Weeknd.

In the face of heartbreak and unexpected revelations, it is crucial to approach these circumstances with empathy and respect for the emotions of those involved. The Weeknd's courageous choice to sever ties with Gomez was undoubtedly a decision made with great consideration, regardless of external influences.

As the world grapples with this profound loss, it becomes increasingly imperative for fans to navigate this difficult period with grace and dignity, providing the necessary space for both artists to heal. Society's fascination with celebrity romance should never supersede the basic human right to privacy and emotional well-being.

Gomez and The Weeknd, two consummate professionals in their respective crafts, now find themselves treading uncharted waters, seeking solace in the complexities of their individual journeys. While their love story remains an indelible chapter in both their lives, it is the responsibility of society to respect their decision and allow them to grow separately, untethered by the vulturous gaze of public opinion.

And who knows, maybe that lumpy dimpled flesh will look really feminine on her. It is creating a buzz in the media as this is not what you hear from a TV personality everyday. After all, every ordinary people might have cellulite in their body.

The story features a zoomed-in photo of purported cellulite on Jenner’s leg.

Speaking candidly about her personal experiences, Jenner has revealed that she finds a peculiar sense of joy and authenticity in the presence of cellulite. This unexpected revelation sheds light on the complex and multifaceted nature of gender identity, challenging societal norms and preconceived notions.

As an individual who has carried the weight of public scrutiny throughout her transition, Jenner's willingness to share her thoughts is both commendable and thought-provoking. In a world often fixated on narrow definitions of beauty and perfection, her bold perspective encourages us to reevaluate our understanding of femininity as a whole.

Drawing from her own struggles and triumphs on this deeply personal journey, Caitlyn Jenner avows that embracing cellulite has become an integral part of her expression as a woman. Contrary to societal expectations that often strive for an unblemished exterior, Jenner's perspective transcends these confines, emphasizing that true womanhood encompasses a wide array of experiences and appearances.

(Photo: MIKE NELSON, EPA-EFE)  This Coach minidress-sized leather jacket of a garment Gomez is wearing is doing everything for us right now, especially paired with her messy new bleach-blonde hair.  Jenna Dewan Tatum  We Dewan-t this look to end. (Photo: Gregg DeGuire, WireImage)  Bravo to Dewan Tatum for nailing this nude look from Julien MacDonald.  Demi Lovato  Old Hollywood vibes. (Photo: MIKE NELSON, EPA-EFE)  Lovato's Ester Abner look is vaguely Morticia Addams and a little Elizabeth Taylor and completely and totally flattering on her.  Pink  Pretty and Pink. (Photo: MIKE NELSON, EPA-EFE)  Yes, Pink's Monique Lhullier gown is exceedingly pink. But fans don't often see the singer in overly girlish dresses, and these Disney princess vibes look nice on her.  Tracee Ellis Ross  Maroon 5? She's more like a Maroon 10. (Photo: Jon Kopaloff, FilmMagic)  Tracee Ellis Ross was tasked with hosting this year's AMAs, and she set a high bar on the red carpet in Stella McCartney.  Worst dressed  Nick Cannon  Sorry, Nick, but we Cannon stand this pants-boots combo. (Photo: Jordan Strauss, Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP)  Cannon normally looks like a bedazzled mess on the red carpet, and the AMAs were no exception.  Kehlani  Noodling around. (Photo: MARK RALSTON, AFP/Getty Images)  From far away, Kehlani looks like she's wearing a standard naked dress. Up close, she looks like she lost a battle with a colander of spaghetti.  Rachel Platten  ""This is our fight song / This jumpsuit's a fright song"" (Photo: Jeff Kravitz/AMA2017, FilmMagic for dcp)  Between the sheerness and the stripes and the odd strips of coverage, this jumpsuit is too strangely constructed for us to get on board with Platten's adventurous look.  Machine Gun Kelly  Oof. (Photo: Steve Granitz, WireImage)  The rapper's suit looks like a kids' bedroom carpet, complete with mini cars on his lapel. We didn't know the Ikea's children's section made bespoke garments.  Alessia Cara  We were rooting for you! We were all rooting for you! (Photo: Gregg DeGuire, WireImage)  Cara is as loveable of a personality as they come in pop music. If only we loved this bodysuit/sweatpants/boots combination as much.  Julia Michaels  ""Red velvet cupcake,"" the dress. (Photo: Steve Granitz, WireImage)  Same goes for Michaels, whose poofy red gown doesn't quite match Pink's fairytale princess interpretation of their similar look.

Pitt is an honorary member of the Epidermolysis Bullosa Medical Research Foundation (EBMRF) that is dedicated to raising money and awareness for the rare skin disorder, epidermolysis bullosa.In January, Pitt introduced singer Chris Cornell during a Rock4EB annual charity to support EBMRF.Further, he revealed in a 2013 Esquire Magazine interview that he self-diagnosed himself with a rare disease – prosopagnosia — also known as face blindness. According to the article, ""Brad Pitt won't remember you. If you've met him, he'll have no idea who you are when he meets you again. Even if you've had what he calls ""a real conversation,"" your face will start fading from his memory as soon as you walk away.""It should be noted that being diagnosed with a condition and being self-diagnosed with a condition can be 2 very different diagnoses.Prosopagnosia refers to the inability to recognize familiar people from their face. They may also be unable to recognize other stimuli, such as objects, cars, or animals.People with prosopagnosia typically learn to use non-face cues including voice, walking style and hairstyle to recognize others. The underlying genetic cause of developmental prosopagnosia is not known but familial reports of this condition are consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance.Epidermolysis bullosa (aka 'the worst disease you've never heard of') is a group of devastating, life-threatening genetic skin disorders impacting children that is characterized by skin blisters and erosions all over the body.The most severe form, recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, is characterized by chronic skin blistering, open and painful wounds, joint contractures, esophageal strictures, pseudosyndactyly, corneal abrasions and a shortened life span. Patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa lack functional type VII collagen (C7) owing to mutations in the gene COL7A1 that encodes for C7 and is the main component of anchoring fibrils that attach the dermis to the epidermis.Epidermolysis bullosa patients suffer through intense pain throughout their lives, with no effective treatments available to reduce the severity of their symptoms.",1,en,"MAY 02, 2017  RDR Staff  About prosopagnosia  About epidermolysis bullosa  Stay informed on the latest rare disease news and developments by signing up for our newsletter","MAY 02, 2017  RDR Staff - Prosopagnosia and Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB), two rare diseases that have long eluded the public's attention, have recently gained prominence in medical discussions.

USA TODAY President Trump in Trump Tower. (Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP) Corrections & Clarifications: A previous version of the story included a tweet from a parody account claiming to Jill Biden. NEW YORK CITY – President Trump's argument Tuesday that left wing groups were just as violent as the white supremacists who staged a demonstration in Charlottesville set off a firestorm of criticism from members of his own party – and raised questions about his personal views of racial tensions in the country. Just one day after Trump sought to tamp down on controversy by condemning white supremacists for their role in racially motivated clashes in the Virginia city, the president appeared to return to his highly criticized initial response that many sides were to blame for the weekend violence. ""What about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, alt-right?"" Trump told reporters in a chaotic impromptu press conference at Trump Tower. ""Do they have any semblance of guilt? What about the fact they came charging with clubs in their hands?"" Trump said he couldn't make a condemnation of hate groups earlier because he didn't ""know all the facts"" about an alleged white nationalist who crashed a car into a crowd of protesters, killing one person and wounded 19 others. CLOSE From Trump Tower in New York City, President Trump told reporters that both sides were to blame for the violence that occurred in Charlottesville, Virginia. USA TODAY ""I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct,"" Trump said from Trump Tower in New York, after an event that was intended to be devoted to a new infrastructure executive order. Trump has been especially quick to denounce previous terrorist attacks, including those taking place overseas. Yet he was notably reticent to pinpoint the blame for one on Saturday that involved white supremacists – a point his critics on both sides of the aisle continued to hammer. ""We must be clear. White supremacy is repulsive. This bigotry is counter to all this country stands for. There can be no moral ambiguity,” said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. added: ""There is only one side to be on when a white supremacist mob brutalizes and murders in America.” Several lawmakers were dismayed the president appeared to equate white supremacists with their opponents. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., tweeted: ""Blaming 'both sides' for #Charlottesville?! No. Back to relativism when dealing with KKK, Nazi sympathizers, white supremacists? Just no."" Another Republican, Rep. Charlie Dent from Pennsylvania, said Trump ""must stop the moral equivalency! AGAIN."" Over the weekend, Trump faced heavy criticism from both Republicans and Democrats for chiding ""many sides"" for their role in the violence in Charlottesville on Saturday, a statement many regarded as tepid toward racists. A full two days later, on Monday, Trump at the White House directly condemned the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists and announced the Justice Department would open up a civil rights investigation into the driver of the car that killed Charlottesville resident Heather Heyer. Yet on Tuesday, amid questions about whether Trump meant the words behind his most recent scripted statement, the president called his initial response ""fine"" and blamed the press for being dishonest in its coverage. ""There was no way of making a correct statement that early,"" he said at one point. ""I had to see the facts. Unlike a lot of reporters – I didn't know (prominent white supremacist) David Duke was there. I wanted to see the facts."" For his part, former KKK leader Duke tweeted a thank you to the president after his statement Tuesday – for condemning ""the leftist terrorists"" in Black Lives Matter and Antifa.",1,en,"CLOSE From Trump Tower in New York City, President Trump told reporters that he believed both protesters and counter protesters were to blame for the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia.","President Trump Blames Both Protesters and Counter Protesters for Charlottesville Violence

New York City, NY - In a statement delivered from his renowned Trump Tower in New York City, President Donald Trump attributed blame to both protesters and counter-protesters for the recent bout of violence that erupted in Charlottesville, Virginia. The President's remarks, made during a press conference on Tuesday, have further intensified the already high tensions surrounding the tragic events that unfolded over the weekend.

The President's view, though met with considerable controversy and criticism, underlined his belief in the shared culpability of both groups involved. Speaking in front of a gathering of journalists, President Trump addressed the nation, stating, ""I condemn hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides. There were good people on both sides of this altercation, and we must examine the actions of all involved.""

These comments by the President emerged in response to the widely-reported confrontations between white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and other far-right groups, as well as the opposition from counter-protesters who firmly denounced such extremist ideologies. Illustrating the complexity and growing polarization of the issue, President Trump's declaration comes amidst a flurry of debates regarding his stance on racial tensions and his response to the Charlottesville tragedy.

The President's insistence on putting ""blame on many sides"" ignited a chorus of displeasure, with critics accusing him of inadvertently endorsing fringe groups and not unequivocally condemning white supremacists. The assailant who reportedly plowed a car into a crowd of anti-racist demonstrators, resulting in the death of Heather Heyer and leaving several others wounded, was widely purported to have ties to white supremacist organizations.

While President Trump's comments evoked a range of reactions, it is important to note that he called for unity and healing in a country that has become acutely aware of the deep-rooted divisions that continue to fester. Although his statements may not have been perceived as a satisfactory condemnation by some, they did attempt to reflect the President's belief that multiple parties bear responsibility for the escalated violence.

As Charlottesville lingers in the minds of Americans across the country, the remarks made by President Trump will undoubtedly continue to dominate discussions and fuel passionate debates surrounding the nature of racial polarization in the United States, as well as the appropriate response that such turbulent times demand. With an unwavering commitment to fostering national healing, the nation now awaits the next steps to be taken by those who hold the responsibility of bringing the country together."

In a recent revelation, renowned Hollywood actress Nicole, aged 50, has found herself amidst growing scrutiny as reports suggest her struggles in completing even the most rudimentary of tasks. According to a reputable publication, the acclaimed actress's alleged ""flakiness"" appears to have become a source of vexation for her husband, Keith Urban.

The claims surrounding Nicole's multitasking abilities, or lack thereof, have sparked curiosity and concern among her loyal fans and avid followers. Citing sources close to the couple, esteemed news outlet Globe has highlighted the strain inflicted upon Keith Urban, the critically acclaimed musician and Nicole's loving husband.

While the entertainment industry holds Nicole in high regard for her impeccable acting prowess, recent reports have brought to light her apparent inability to bring tasks to completion.

Over the years, her name has become synonymous with raw talent, delivering captivating performances across a diverse range of cinematic genres.

In light of these developments, Nicole Kidman herself has refrained from making any public statements relating to these allegations. Gleaming in their marriage are glimpses of devotion and affection, reflective of their unwavering love and commitment to one another.

While the multifarious nature of Nicole's commitments continues to push her boundaries, it is important to remember that celebrities, like all human beings, are susceptible to imperfections and the occasional misstep.

gossipcop-262742935,"Hugh Jackman was a guest on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert tonight, and Colbert had an important question for the Logan actor: now that he’s done playing Wolverine, will we finally get to see “fat Jackman?”  Jackman has been playing Wolverine since 1999, and it’s been seventeen years that he’s had to stay in peak physical condition so that he could perform shirtless scenes for the movies. Jackman even described the process that goes into the filming of shirtless scenes, which he said involves drinking ten liters of water a day in the months leading up to the scenes, which he said are accomplished through dehydration.  “It’s sort of unbelievable to me, what I did for seventeen years,” Jackman revealed. “The first one, I thought you could get into shape in three weeks. The director pushed all the ‘shirt off’ scenes to the very end.”  “You stop drinking water about 30 hours before you shoot,” Jackman said, explaining the process. “You lose ten pounds of water weight.”  But now that that’s over, Jackman is already enjoying himself.  “Now I’m eating and loving it,” Jackman told Colbert. “Sometimes waking up at two in the morning just to have breakfast cereal, and then go back to bed.”  “With it still in my lap,” he added.  One of us! One of us! One of us!  Logan is in theaters now.

The actor expressed sincere gratitude for the immense support he has received throughout his career, recognizing the deep bond formed between himself and his fans during his tenure as Wolverine.

""I am truly humbled by the unwavering love and dedication from my fans, who have been instrumental in making Wolverine the character he is today. However, the time has come for me to explore new horizons, diving into a wide range of roles that will challenge me both physically and emotionally,"" Jackman conveyed, his voice filled with both admiration and excitement.

gossipcop-3016533567,"Tobey Maguire did NOT pursue Emma Stone and get her phone number at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles, despite a made-up tabloid report. Gossip Cop can exclusively bust this claim. We’re told it “never happened.”  © Gossip Cop (Getty Images)  According to Life & Style, Maguire recently spotted the La La Land star at the swanky Hollywood hotel. A so-called “source” tells the magazine, “He was checking her out a lot, hoping she’d notice him.” The outlet’s dubious insider goes on to say that the actor eventually approached her, and began “showering her with cheesy compliments, telling her how all of Hollywood was in love with her.”  The magazine’s “source” then purports that Stone “didn’t seem interested in him,” but she “finally gave him her number and suggested meeting up for coffee, then ran off.” The supposed insider adds, “It was pretty obvious she was blowing him off.”  Gossip Cop, however, checked in with a reliable source close to the actor, who exclusively tells us the tabloid’s entire account of events is made-up and simply “never happened.” Unfortunately, we’re not surprised that Life & Style published this completely fictitious story. Gossip Cop previously busted the outlet for falsely alleging Eva Mendes was jealous of Stone’s friendship with Ryan Gosling. There was no truth to that claim, and the same goes for this latest one.",1,en,"Tobey Maguire did NOT pursue Emma Stone and get her phone number at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles, despite a made-up tabloid report.","Los Angeles, California - In a stunning revelation today, it has come to our attention that famed actor Tobey Maguire did not engage in any romantic pursuit of actress Emma Stone, contrary to a fabricated and baseless claim propagated by a well-known tabloid publication. This bogus report alleged that Maguire, renowned for his iconic portrayal of Spider-Man, obtained Stone's phone number during an encounter at the illustrious Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles.

Setting the record straight, we can confirm that there is no truth to these salacious claims, which have not only sought to distribute unfounded gossip but have also tarnished the reputations of both Maguire and Stone. Reputable sources close to the actors have vehemently denied any such incident occurring or any indication of a romantic interest between the two industry professionals.

It is disheartening to witness the erosion of ethical journalism, as this story epitomizes the dangerous consequences that arise from sensationalist reporting. Responsible journalism should prioritize authenticity, fact-checking, and respect for the privacy and livelihoods of individuals in the public eye. Regrettably, incidents such as this only serve to undermine the integrity of the media and erode public trust.

The Chateau Marmont, an esteemed and exclusive establishment frequented by celebrities and known for its privacy and luxurious ambiance, has also been dragged into this narrative. This unfounded report not only sullies the reputation of Tobey Maguire and Emma Stone but also places an undeserved stain on the Chateau's esteemed clientele. It tarnishes the hospitality and discretion that the renowned hotel has fostered for decades.

As representatives and fans of both Tobey Maguire and Emma Stone, let us remember to rally behind truth, integrity, and a rejection of sensationalism. Baseless rumors and fabricated stories have no place in the realm of responsible journalism and should be met with the disdain they deserve.

In conclusion, Tobey Maguire, the esteemed actor who has captivated audiences on both the silver screen and stage, did not pursue Emma Stone at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles, nor did he obtain her phone number. We urge the public to refrain from perpetuating or believing these unfounded claims and to differentiate between legitimate news and the tabloid fodder that seeks to deceive and misinform."

In a surprising twist following her recent separation from actor Justin Theroux, Hollywood icon Jennifer Aniston finds herself questioning the nature of a blossoming friendship, casting speculation on whether it may have developed into something more. Reports suggest that Aniston has been contemplating whether her co-star, whose on-set camaraderie grew during the filming of Maniac, transformed into an unexpected romance, overlapping with her own long-standing relationship.

Aniston, renowned for her timeless talent and striking charisma on the silver screen, is known to be highly reserved about her personal life. However, amidst the emotional turbulence of her separation from Theroux earlier this year, keen observers have detected a blend of curiosity and concern in the actress as she ponders the possibility of her co-star's role in the disintegration of her marriage.

The pair first kindled a close bond on the set of their hit Netflix show, Maniac. With hours spent together, perfecting their craft and bringing the riveting show to life, it seemed natural that their connection would develop beyond the confines of their on-screen roles. Aniston's inner circle has revealed that this evolution has sowed seeds of uncertainty within the acclaimed actress, raising questions about the timing and nature of their developing friendship.

While rumors percolating within the entertainment industry often lack concrete evidence, this predicament has gained traction within the media landscape, capturing the attention of fans and pundits alike. Supporters of Aniston have been left speculating over whether her co-star played a more integral role in her professional and personal life than initially perceived.

The situation, as mentioned, is rather delicate, as it dares to explore the timing of events while Aniston and Theroux were still a couple. The recent parting of ways between the former lovebirds, celebrated for their shared passions and status within Hollywood, only served to amplify the intrigue surrounding Aniston's potential romantic connection with her co-star.

As Aniston navigates the tumultuous waters surrounding her separation, it is evident that her primary focus remains on personal growth and healing. Nevertheless, even the most composed individuals cannot escape moments of introspection, prompting them to question the many facets of their past associations. Aniston's emotional journey underscores the human tendency to examine the untrodden paths of relationships that intertwine with changing circumstances.

Reminding ourselves that the truth of this matter may forever dwell within the recesses of the private lives of Aniston and her co-star, it is essential to acknowledge the emotional toll a separation often takes, and the residual questions that can arise in its wake. With respect to Aniston's privacy and right to navigate her own narrative, truth and understanding shall undoubtedly emerge in due course, allowing for a complete picture of this intriguing situation to develop.

In a world captivated by larger-than-life tales, it is moments like these that remind us of the complexity of human relationships, the bonds formed within the entertainment industry, and the delicate balance between personal and professional boundaries. Jennifer Aniston's contemplation may linger for now, but as time unveils its secrets, we can only trust the journey it will ultimately illuminate."

She’s a lesbian.’ I’m not a lesbian, I’m pansexual,” Natalie, 28, told Us Weekly on the “Watch With Us” podcast. “She outed me in a really aggressive way and kept going.

Since then, the story has developed continuously, with a large number of women coming forward to say they were sexually harassed or assaulted by Weinstein - allegations he has denied. Here is a summary of the events so far: 5 October 2017 The New York Times publishes a story detailing decades of allegations of sexual harassment against Harvey Weinstein. Actresses Rose McGowan and Ashley Judd are among the women who come forward. Among the accusations are that he forced women to massage him and watch him naked. He also promised to help advance their careers in return for sexual favours. Weinstein issues an apology acknowledging he ""has caused a lot of pain"" - but disputes allegations he harassed female employees over nearly three decades. Weinstein's lawyer tells The Hollywood Reporter his client is preparing to sue the New York Times. Weinstein says he is taking a ""leave of absence"" from The Weinstein Company and is working with a therapist. 6 October 2017 Brie Larson and Lena Dunham are among those to react to the allegations in the article, praising the bravery of those who have come forward.

Argento says the incident happened in 1997 in the south of France while Stoller, who now goes under the name Evans, says she was forced into a sexual act by the producer after going for a casting meeting in 2004. Mira Sorvino, who starred in several of Weinstein's films, told the New Yorker that Weinstein sexually harassed her and tried to pressure her into a physical relationship. Weinstein's spokeswoman Sallie Hofmeister tells the publication: ""Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr Weinstein.""

It describes the allegations against Weinstein as ""repugnant"" and ""abhorrent"".

Weinstein has ""unequivocally denied"" any allegations of non-consensual sex in a statement released through his publicist. Amazon Studio chief Roy Price is put on a ""leave of absence"".

I’m gonna be just like everybody else with NO hot tea — but we’re gonna try and do this one for you, because I just want to show my appreciation for everyone who speaks out for justice, and tries to make the world a better place.”  Twitter was overjoyed by the request, taking to their social media pages with plenty of LOL-inducing memes that even the “I Don’t” singer herself got in on, joking, “Found my tea!” with a shot of herself sipping the hot beverage.

Surprising her fans and capturing the attention of the internet, Carey has decided to venture into the world of selling T-shirts. Yes, you read that correctly! 

The internet has been abuzz with excitement over Mariah Carey's recent endeavors. From her unforgettable, albeit controversial, actions at the Golden Globes, where she ""stole"" Meryl Streep's limelight, to her seemingly innocuous tweet that has singlehandedly altered the course of brunch forever, Carey has become the talk of the town. 

However, it is her iconic and meme-inducing moment during her New Year's Eve performance that has prompted the pop diva to delve into the realm of merchandise. The incident, which marked the first of 2018, garnered significant attention and has proven to be a catalyst for Carey's unexpected leap into the T-shirt business. 

The sheer impact of Carey's meme-inducing moment cannot be overstated. Capturing the hearts of internet trolls and social media enthusiasts, her performance quickly spread throughout online platforms, transforming her into an overnight internet sensation. 

Recognizing the immense popularity and market demand surrounding her New Year's Eve performance, Carey has taken a bold step by capitalizing on her notoriety. By selling T-shirts inspired by her infamous onstage moment, she is meeting the desires of her dedicated fan base, ensuring they can now wear a piece of pop culture history. 

While some may view this endeavor as a mere publicity stunt, it is important to acknowledge the strategic mindset behind Carey's decision. In today's digital age, viral moments are fleeting, and capitalizing on them is essential for any public figure seeking to maintain relevance. By aligning her merchandise with the unforgettable incident, Carey is embracing the power of social media and transforming her fleeting fame into a tangible and marketable asset. 

Moreover, this foray into the T-shirt business demonstrates Mariah Carey's astute business acumen. Not content with being solely recognized as a talented performer, she realizes the importance of diversifying her portfolio. Through selling T-shirts, Carey is expanding her brand and tapping into a new revenue stream that will undoubtedly complement her already flourishing music career. 

As we eagerly anticipate what the future holds for Mariah Carey, one thing remains crystal clear: her ability to turn a momentary occurrence into a timeless business opportunity is nothing short of admirable. With her meme-inducing T-shirts poised to captivate the market, Carey has proven once again that she is not only a force to be reckoned with in the music industry but also a savvy entrepreneur."

gossipcop-3308884181,"Beyoncé Rumored To Be Asking For Silent Delivery  As the countdown to Blueprint 1 and Blueprint 2’s arrival continues, the stories about Bey’s birth plans abound. First, we heard she planned to give birth at home, then they said her security has been running weekly drills to practice their approach to Cedars-Sinai and now there’s a report that Bey wants silence in the delivery room.  According to Naughty Gossip reports:  “Beyoncé likes peace and calm around her. She has zero time for drama and gossip. She likes her inner circle to be soft spoken if they have to talk at all. And you can expect the same will be true when she gives birth to the twins,” sources tell Straight Shuter. “You can only get into her private life if you are invited. She is very guarded and protects her privacy at all cost. She likes to be surrounded with peaceful colors and soft sounds. This will be of utmost importance for her when giving birth.”  This story is almost like opening up a fortune cookie or visiting your average storefront psychic. EVERYBODY knows Beyoncé is private. THAT doesn’t take an exclusive source to figure out.  Silent birth is a real thing though – something that Scientologists practice and Katie Holmes even did when she gave birth to Suri, but as much as Bey loves music we don’t really see her doing a silent birth.  Speaking of Bey’s love of music… Hit the flip for some recently posted pics of her from a Michael Jackson/Prince party.  GettyImages/Instagram",1,en,"Beyoncé Rumored To Be Asking For Silent Delivery  As the countdown to Blueprint 1 and Blueprint 2’s arrival continues, the stories about Bey’s birth plans abound.","Beyoncé Rumored To Be Asking For Silent Delivery

Amidst much anticipation surrounding the arrival of her highly awaited Blueprint 1 and Blueprint 2, global music icon Beyoncé Knowles-Carter finds herself at the center of swirling rumors regarding her birth plans. Gaining considerable attention from fans and media alike, speculation has emerged suggesting that the renowned singer is allegedly requesting a silent delivery. 

As the countdown to the release of her musical masterpieces continues, countless sources have come forward claiming to possess insider information about the Grammy Award-winning artist's birthing preferences. While these reports should be taken with caution until confirmed by official sources, they only serve to intensify the intrigue and curiosity surrounding one of the world's most celebrated entertainers.

The notion of Beyoncé opting for a silent delivery has sparked a wave of speculation and debate among her fervent followers. Considering her extraordinary talent and unwavering dedication to her craft, it comes as no surprise that every aspect of the artist's personal life is subject to intense public scrutiny. This latest development, if substantiated, would undoubtedly add another layer of fascination to Beyoncé's already illustrious career.

For those unfamiliar with the concept, a silent delivery, also known as a noiseless childbirth, is an innovative birthing technique that places great emphasis on tranquility and minimizing external disturbances during labor and delivery. Advocates claim that it promotes a serene environment, allowing mothers to experience a more comfortable and relaxed birthing process. Although silent deliveries remain a relatively rare occurrence, they have gained attention in recent years as celebrities and influencers have embraced alternative birthing methods.

While Beyoncé's alleged request for a noise-free delivery may seem unconventional to some, it underscores her commitment to embracing motherhood on her own terms. As a trailblazer in the music industry and a formidable force for empowerment, Beyoncé's choices often defy societal norms and inspire countless individuals around the world. Her rumored desire for a silent delivery serves as a reminder that motherhood, like any other journey, can be personalized and celebrated in whichever way an individual sees fit.

As fervent speculation continues, it is imperative to approach these rumors with prudence and respect for Beyoncé's privacy. Until an official statement is released by her representatives, it remains speculative and subject to change. Nonetheless, the buzz surrounding Beyoncé's birth plans adds yet another captivating chapter to her legacy, leaving fans eagerly awaiting any confirmation or clarification from the iconic star herself."

The photo shoot promises to be Caitlyn's finest hour since she first announced her transition in an interview with ABC’s Diane Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July  Although the Kardashian-Jenner clan is said to be ‘wholly supportive’ of Jenner’s transition, sources close to the family say the prospect of a nude shoot is ‘their worst nightmare’  An insider tells DailyMail.com that the Kardashians learned of the 67-year-old’s plan from her model son Brody, 33.  ‘Brody told them that Caitlyn has planned and booked a full nude photo shoot and they were like, that’s unacceptable, it’s taking things too far,' the source said.  ‘They’re hoping the shoot doesn't come to pass because that would be their worst nightmare. Taking it to that level and unveiling her [new body] with a fully naked photo spread is going way too far.'  Kardashian momager Kris, who is said to have known about Jenner’s surgery in advance, has vowed to stop the shoot from going ahead, according to the insider.  ‘She knew the surgery was inevitable and it was bound to happen,’ said the source. ‘But she says she will do everything in her power to stop the shoot if she can.'  DailyMail.com has approached representatives for Jenner and the Kardashians for comment. Jenner's rep knew nothing about it.  Jenner first announced her transition in an interview with Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July.  The headline-making ‘I am Cait’ shoot was said to have taken the Kardashian clan by surprise at the time and led to tension between Jenner and Kim, 36, as a result.  Nevertheless, the family have been publicly supportive of her decision to transition, which was completed in January according leaked extracts from her memoir.  Jenner wrote of the $20,000 operation: 'The surgery was a success, and I feel not only wonderful but liberated […] I am going to live authentically for the first time in my life.  ‘I am going to have an enthusiasm for life that I have not had in 39 years since the Olympics, almost two thirds of my life.'  But the book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife and step-children.  Sources close to the family told DailyMail.com that Jenner’s ‘unpredictable’ behavior has also played a part in their current estrangement.  The insider said: ‘[The book] is definitely something that she’s wanted to do for a while and it was just a matter of time before she got it done.  ‘But the family were like, it’s probably going to reopen the drama of everything [that has happened].  ‘They were worried because she’s been so unpredictable lately and just trying to get out into the limelight.’  Jenner's book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife  A second leaked extract from the memoir has already proven embarrassing, after Jenner claimed the late Robert Kardashian knew O.J.

Sources close to the situation have revealed to DailyMail.com that the 67-year-old socialite and transgender activist, who underwent gender reassignment surgery in January, has expressed her intention to bare it all for a visually striking and intimate portrayal.

Captivating readers' attention with her recent memoir, 'The Secrets of My Life', Jenner courageously divulges the innermost details of her personal journey, captivating the world and revealing her genuine self. This forthcoming venture, some might argue, represents yet another audacious stride taken by the iconic transgender advocate.

The decision to partake in a nude photo shoot is undoubtedly an audacious move by Jenner, signaled both by her willingness to expose her newly transformed body and her desire to challenge societal taboos surrounding the depiction of gender and sexuality. By embracing vulnerability and confronting society head-on, Jenner is positioning herself as a powerful symbol of emancipation for the transgender community.

While the news has ignited fervent discussions and debates, it is important to recognize that Jenner's decision is a personal one, born out of a profound journey of self-discovery. It is a testament to the courage and authenticity she continuously embodies, empowering individuals globally to embrace their own identities without fear or prejudice.

However, amid the intrigue surrounding this revelation, it is essential to approach this matter with sensitivity, ensuring that Jenner's autonomy and the significance of her transgender experience are respected. As society progresses towards greater understanding and acceptance of gender diversity, it is paramount that we foster an environment of inclusivity and support for individuals navigating their unique path.

Caitlyn Jenner's proposed nude photo shoot marks a pivotal moment in her ongoing journey, positioning her as a transgressive force within a world that struggles to redefine traditional norms. Forging a path towards acceptance, she not only challenges society's preconceived notions but paves the way for others to follow suit.

As this news continues to ripple across society, it serves as a vital reminder that the journey of transgender individuals is one deserving of respect, understanding, and compassion. Caitlyn Jenner's forthcoming photo shoot stands as a courageous act, a milestone in her personal emancipation, and a catalyst for stimulating conversations about gender identity in an ever-evolving world."

gossipcop-6742180407,"It was a humid 84 degrees in Bridgehampton on Saturday, but that didn’t stop a crowd of people from descending upon Topping Rose House for Jill Zarin’s annual luncheon. The former Real Housewife of New York, ran around the grounds in an A-line Carolina Herrera dress, posing on the step-and-repeat, taking photos with fans, and catching up with old friends. Trying to track her down for an interview turned into a scavenger hunt.  Scattered around the lawn were tables for vendors selling everything from wine to sex toys. There was a station for guests to get a vitamin infusion, with seats in the direct line of the sun transforming the spot into an inescapable sauna-I.V. drip hybrid. Housewives from across the country flew into town for the occasion (Vicki Gunvalson of Orange County and LeeAnne Locken of Dallas), which also served as a benefit for Thyroid Cancer Research in honor of Zarin’s late husband, Bobby, who died of the disease in January.  Upon first try to flag Zarin down for a couple of questions, she sent over her daughter, Ally Shapiro, in her stead. Shapiro reflected on last year’s luncheon, when her stepfather was still struggling with cancer, but encouraged her and her mother to party on.  “He loved drinking and partying. This was the highlight of his year,” she said. “It was this time last year that we were told he wasn’t gonna make it another week, and he pushed us and he said, ‘Go to the party. Maybe I won’t be here when you come back, but go.’”  Shapiro, who now lives in London while she works on her master’s degree, admits that she can’t watch old episodes of Real Housewives, which showed her as 14-year-old struggling to get close to her stepfather. “You want to think that it’s like a home movie, but it’s not. That’s not what our relationship was like,” she said, adding that the reruns play constantly in the U.K. “I’m walking down the street and someone’s like, ‘Oh my God, I just saw you trying on a prom dress!’”  She also said that her mother is dabbling with dating, specifically with a man she plays tennis with. “It’s fun, and I live in London so it’s good for her to have a distraction.”  Dina Lohan, dressed in a metallic green blazer and shorts set and a pair of oversized aviators, arrived fashionably late to the affair, but was immediately greeted by hoards of people trying to chat her up or get a photo. Eventually secured in the same spot for more than a few seconds, she was willing to talk about her daughter Lindsay’s upcoming project for MTV, a Vanderpump Rules–inspired reality show that follows Lindsay and the employees of her new Lohan Beach Club. Bunim/Murray Productions is producing the series, the same company that produced Lohan’s E! reality show Living Lohan a decade ago.  “These kids were like, babies, and now they’re running the show,” she said of the crew. “They lived in my house! And now they’re all corporate. . . . We’re home. It’s cyclical, you know.”  Lohan also revealed that the upcoming series is a bit of a family affair with Lindsay’s younger sister, 24-year-old Ali, providing the theme song.  A friend of Lohan’s interjected, asking if Ali, like her older sister over a decade ago, had moved out to L.A. for work.  “She’s in New York with me,” the matriarch answered. “I keep them close! I’m not going to lose someone to L.A., no. Not again!”  Finally, the woman of the hour managed to stop and take a breath. While Zarin may no longer be a Bravo housewife, she still knows how to schmooze like one. She’s been keeping up with the latest season of the show here and there, and even received a good-luck message from Luann de Lesseps, who checked into rehab earlier in the month, wishing her good luck on the event. Having brought me up to speed, Zarin closed our conversation with a plug for her new line of “pet-proof, gorgeous, and inexpensive” rugs, aptly titled Jill Zarin Rugs.

Sony Pictures distributes the Spider-Man films, which they continue to own, finance, and have final creative control over.[2] Phase One Iron Man (2008) [15] produced Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk. Avi Arad, who helped secure early financing,producedand Billionaire industrialist Tony Stark builds himself a suit of armor after he is taken captive by a terrorist organization. Free from his captors, he decides to upgrade and don his armor in order to hunt down weapons that were sold under the table.[16] In April 2006, Marvel hired Jon Favreau to direct Iron Man,[4] with the writing teams of Art Marcum and Matt Holloway and Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby writing competing scripts.[4][17] Favreau consolidated both into one script, which was then polished by John August.[5] Robert Downey, Jr. was cast in the title role in September 2006, after growing out a goatee and working out to convince the filmmakers he was right for the part.[18] Principal photography began on March 12, 2007,[19] with the first few weeks spent on Stark's captivity in Afghanistan,[20] which was filmed in Inyo County, California.[21] Production also occurred on the former Hughes Company soundstages in Playa Vista, Los Angeles, California,[22] with additional filming at Edwards Air Force Base[23] and Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada.[24] Iron Man premiered at the Greater Union theater in George Street, Sydney, on April 14, 2008,[25] and was released internationally on April 30, and in the United States on May 2.[26][27] The film ends with a post-credits scene featuring Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, who approaches Stark regarding the ""Avenger Initiative"". Favreau said that he included the scene as ""a little tip of the hat for the fans...a way to sort of tee up The Avengers."" Jackson was only on set for a day, with a skeleton crew to avoid the news of his cameo leaking.[28] Captain America's shield is also visible in the background of a scene; it was added by an ILM artist as a joke, and Favreau decided to leave it in the film.[29] The Incredible Hulk (2008) After being exposed to gamma radiation that causes him to transform into the monstrous Hulk, scientist Bruce Banner goes on the run and isolates himself from his love, Betty Ross. Hunted by the military, Banner seeks to cure himself and prevent his condition from being weaponized.[30] In January 2006,[31] Marvel reclaimed the film rights for the Hulk character from Universal Pictures after Universal failed to meet a deadline to develop a sequel to director Ang Lee's 2003 film Hulk.[32] Universal retained distribution rights for future Hulk films.[32] Instead of moving forward with a sequel, Marvel hired Louis Leterrier to direct The Incredible Hulk, a reboot.[6] Leterrier initially turned down the job out of respect for Lee, but later reconsidered and signed on.[6] The script was written by Zak Penn, who drafted a treatment for the 2003 film.[33] In April 2006, Edward Norton entered negotiations to portray Bruce Banner and rewrite Penn's script,[34] although Penn received sole credit for the screenplay.[7] Production began on July 9, 2007 and filming primarily took place in Toronto,[35] with additional filming in New York City and Rio de Janeiro.[36] The film premiered at the Gibson Amphitheatre on June 8, 2008, and was released on June 13.[37][38] The film takes place simultaneously with the events of Iron Man 2 and Thor,[39] the former of which is set six months after the events of Iron Man.[40] Downey briefly reprised his role from Iron Man as Tony Stark in a cameo appearance at the end of the film. Downey said that the filmmakers ""were just cross-pollinating our superheroes. It happens to be a scene where I basically approach [actor William Hurt's character General Ross], and we may be considering going into some sort of limited partnership together. The great thing is he—and I don't want to give too much away—but he's in disrepair at the time I find him. It was really"

gossipcop-7384566778,"Kylie Jenner may have skipped out on the 2017 Kardashian Christmas card, but she did attend mom Kris Jenner’s annual Christmas Eve party in Los Angeles.  The 20-year-old cosmetics guru — who is expecting her first child, a baby girl, with boyfriend Travis Scott — did not appear in any photos from the bash shared to social media by KarJenner family members. But a source tells PEOPLE she was there celebrating away from the cameras.  “Kylie looked great but didn’t really draw any attention to her baby bump,” the source says. “She still acts like she wants to keep her pregnancy private.”  Meanwhile, her sister Khloé Kardashian, — who earlier this week confirmed that she and boyfriend Tristan Thompson are expecting their first child together — accentuated her own baby bump in a skin-tight, sparkly jumpsuit with a white fur coat.  “Khloé was beaming all night,” the insider says of the 33-year-old Revenge Body host. “She kept touching and showing off her cute baby belly.”  Khloé showed off her bump on Instagram as well.  “Merry Christmas!! May you sparkle and shine this festive season, may all of your wishes and dreams come true,” Khloé captioned a gallery of shots showing her touching her belly. “I pray that we all may feel this happiness all year round. God bless you! ✨ #BabyBump🤗”  “Merry Christmas!!!!! Wishing all of you and your families much Joy Happiness Peace and Health…” Kris added in her own post, a photo of her and Khloé alongside Kendall Jenner. “Love you guys!!!!!!!! #christmas #blessed #ohholynight.”  Kim Kardashian West, Kris Jenner and Khloé Kardashian Khloe Kardashian/Instagram  Khloé Kardashian and Scott Disic Khloe Kardashian/Instagram  Aside for Khloé and Kendall, Kris’ party also brought together siblings Kim Kardashian West (who’s expecting her third child, via a surrogate), Kourtney Kardashian, and their kids: Kim’s daughter North, 4, and son Saint, 2; and Kourtney son Reign, 3, daughter Penelope, 5, and son Mason, 8.  Kourtney’s ex-boyfriend Scott Disick was there, too — without girlfriend Sofia Richie.  “He mingled, looked good and didn’t drink,” the source says, adding that there wasn’t any awkwardness with Kourtney’s new boyfriend Younes Bendjima.  “Kourtney seemed so happy that Younes joined her,” the insider says. “They are so cute together. He kept bringing her drinks and doting on her. Younes fits right into the family. He didn’t seem uncomfortable that Scott was there. They said hello, but that was it. It was very civil.”  Other guests included Kim’s husband Kanye West, celebrity hair stylists Jen Atkin and Chris Appleton, singer Christina Aguilera and Keeping Up with the Kardashians executive producer Ryan Seacrest. Kris appeared to be in a good mood throughout the night, dancing with Kim and Khloé and playing MC while Babyface, Toni Braxton and Brian McKnight performed.  “Everyone had the most amazing time,” the source tells PEOPLE. “Kris always throws the best parties. It was all gorgeous. There was no drama.”  Rob Kardashian and Khloé Kardashian Khloe Kardashian/Instagram  Kylie Jenner and Khloé Kardashian Khloe Kardashian/Instagram  On Christmas morning, the family gathered at Kourtney’s house to open presents and celebrate the holiday in matching elf-patterned onesies and beanies.  “Merry Christmas!

Two of Robert Kardashian's ex-wives have come forward saying he confided in them that he was unsure of the paternity of the now-27-year-old.  Jan Ashley, who married the businessman after Khloe's mother Kris Jenner, said: 'Khloe is not his kid -- he told me that after we got married.'  And Ellen Pierson, 63, who married Robert in 2003 just two months before his death, has also come forward after eight years of silence to 'tell the truth' about the Kardashian family.  Claims: Two of Robert Kardashian's ex-wives have come forward claiming the lawyer told them Khloe Kardashian, left, was not his real daughter, like older sisters Kim and Kourtney  The reality star has hit back at the claims, calling them 'really low'.  In an explosive interview with Star magazine, Ashley said: 'He just kind of looked at me and said [it] like it was a matter of fact. He said ""Well, you know that Khloe's not really a Kardashian, don't you?""    'And I said… ""OK"" and that was it.'  She claims Khloe, who is married to Dallas Mavericks basketballer Lamar Odom, knew she had a different father to her sisters and younger brother Rob.  'Khloe brought it up all the time. She looked nothing like the rest. She was tall, had a different shape, light hair, curly hair. Didn't look anything like the other three children.'  Different: Khloe has often pointed out that she looks nothing like her older sisters and their mother Kris, far right, said once people asked whether she was 'the milkman's child'  Fighting back: Khloe has responded to the claims today on Twitter She said Robert, who is of Armenian descent, had told her that he and Kris were not sleeping together at the time Khloe was conceived. '[But] he never would have considered a DNA test. He loved her very much. Robert did question the fact that Khloe was his,' Ellen said. 'Any normal man would if they knew their wife had cheated on him.' Khloe has responded to the claims today on Twitter.  Daddy's little girl: Robert Kardashian, pictured with Khloe as a child, referred to having four biological children in court documents filed in 1999 She wrote: 'The audacity you have to mention my father’s name like this! Should be ashamed of urself! I let a lot of things slide but this one is really low… YOU ARE DISGUSTING! (yes you know who YOU are).'    High-profile: Robert represented O.J. Simpson in his murder trial in 1994  Kris, 56, recently admitted in her new book that she cheated on Robert during their marriage.  Since Robert's death, Ellen had experienced financial difficulties, filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2010.  The home she and Robert shared in Indian Wells, California, was sold after going into foreclosure in October.  Kris remarried Olympian Bruce Jenner in 1991 and the couple had two daughters, Kendall and Kylie.  Bruce already had four children from two previous marriages: Burt, Casey, Brody, and Brandon.    Khloe is often talking about how she looks nothing like her sisters, and Kris has been quoted as saying people asked her whether she was 'the milkman's daughter' when she was born.    On Khloe's blog in June 2010, she shared a number of pictures of her and the attorney.  She wrote: 'Father’s Day is two days away, so in preparation I wanted to post this photo album (mostly old school pics) dedicated to my dad and to Bruce.

This explosive claim has ignited a furious dispute within the famous reality TV clan, unfolding yet another chapter of drama and scandal in their already tumultuous lives.

Speaking exclusively to our publication, Robert Kardashian's former wives assert that he openly expressed skepticism regarding Khloe's paternity before his untimely demise. These allegations have opened a Pandora's box of questions about the true lineage of the Kardashian sisters.

Khloe Kardashian, known for her fierce personality, was quick to respond to the sensational claims on her official Twitter account. In a series of now-deleted tweets, she lashed out at her father's ex-wives, branding their statements as ""disgusting"" and ""low."" Clearly, this unexpected bombshell has left Khloe feeling understandably hurt and betrayed.

Adding to the mounting turmoil within the Kardashian family, it's important to note that their matriarch, Kris Jenner, has previously admitted to having affairs during her marriage to the renowned lawyer, Robert Kardashian. This revelation only amplifies the suspicions surrounding Khloe's true parentage.

The impact of these allegations cannot be overstated, as they cast doubt on the strong bonds and family ties that the Kardashian sisters have diligently nurtured throughout their lives. The purported confusion surrounding Khloe's parentage threatens to rock the very foundations upon which their fame, fortune, and global brand have been built.

As this controversy continues to unravel, many are left wondering about the motives behind these claims and why they have surfaced at this particular moment. Undoubtedly, the repercussions of this shocking revelation will have far-reaching consequences for the Kardashians, their loyal fanbase, and their multi-million dollar empire.

For now, it remains to be seen how the Kardashian family will navigate this new storm, one that threatens to forever alter their public perception and reshape the dynamics within their closely-knit circle. As the truth unfolds, the world eagerly awaits the outcome of this captivating and deeply personal saga that has gripped the media's attention and further cemented the Kardashian name in headlines worldwide."

gossipcop-5865271192,"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired.

It’s clear that when it comes to who she dates, Selena apparently is all about maintaining her privacy.  According to our source, it’s only a matter of time before Selena responds to Charlie’s bombshell admission that they were briefly an item — and that Justin Bieber, 23, may have caused the two to go their separate ways. “Now, she will definitely have to respond down the line, and it’s just frustrating when people add their dirty laundry to a situation,” our source added. “She’s learned from the first time dating Justin and The Weeknd that less is more, which explains her relationship with Justin now being much more under the radar.” We reported earlier how Selena and Justin put to rest rumors that they had split by reuniting at one of his hockey games.

Renowned pop star Selena Gomez recently expressed her concern and disappointment over fellow musician Charlie Puth's recent disclosure of his dating history. Citing a reliable source close to Selena, HollywoodLife.com obtained exclusive details concerning her reaction to Puth's unexpectedly open revelations.

Gomez, known for her grace and integrity both on and off the stage, reportedly believes that Puth's decision to publicly discuss his dating past was a misstep. The source, who spoke exclusively to HollywoodLife.com, revealed that Gomez feels strongly about the importance of maintaining a level of privacy, especially when it concerns personal relationships.

The news of Puth's dating history disclosure had fans and fellow celebrities alike buzzing with intrigue and curiosity. However, Gomez, through her close source, voiced concern that with such openness, there is a risk of damaging the privacy and dignity of the individuals involved.

The source emphasized Gomez's deep-rooted conviction that personal relationships should be handled with respect and discretion, away from the scrutinizing eyes of the public. Gomez herself has experienced the intense media attention surrounding her previous high-profile relationships, and this has undoubtedly shaped her stance on matters of privacy.

The insider revealed that Gomez holds no ill-will towards Puth; instead, she empathizes with him as someone who has experienced the pressures and challenges of fame. However, she firmly believes that oversharing intimate details about one's dating life can potentially lead to unnecessary complications, both personally and professionally.

Remaining committed to focusing primarily on her music career, activism, and philanthropy, Gomez aims to create a healthy boundary between her personal life and her life in the public eye. She believes that one's private life should be preserved and respected, rather than put on display for public consumption. Gomez wishes Puth well in his musical endeavors but implores him to reconsider sharing such personal aspects of his life in the future.

Pregnant Kylie Jenner. Pregnant Kylie Jenner. Yet — Kylie Jenner, 20, has not actually confirmed she is pregnant.  For some celebrities, this would not be a big deal — some stars get pregnant and do not say a word, even as “sources” and “insiders” dish to the tabloids, as illustrated above. For someone in the Kardashian-Jenner family, this is especially confusing.  After all, these family members have become international superstars because they share nearly every detail of their lives, even the painful or uncomfortable moments. As a result, people have become inexplicably fascinated by all of them (Kris Jenner, Caitlyn Jenner, Kim Kardashian West, Kourtney Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian and Rob Kardashian), which has fueled their multimillion-dollar franchise of reality shows and sponsorships.  So the decision to keep Kylie’s apparent pregnancy under wraps is very off-brand for the family. This month, speculation will probably hit even more of a fever pitch, as February is the oft-reported due date for her baby, reportedly a girl.

According to reliable reports from Catalonia's regional president, as diligently relayed by the Associated Press, the death toll has tragically risen to at least 12 innocent souls, while an alarming tally of 80 individuals have been rushed to local hospitals for urgent medical attention.

The notorious Las Ramblas, adorned with its iconic pedestrian walkway flanked by historic buildings and countless shops, restaurants, and hotels, has always been a magnet for visitors from around the globe.

Renowned rapper Nicki Minaj recently addressed the swirling rumors surrounding fellow artist Drake, expressing her lack of surprise at claims suggesting he fathered a child from a previous fling with an adult film star. Notably, Minaj alleges that this revelation is consistent with Drake's well-known 'playboy' stereotype, further speculating on the possibility of other individuals seeking financial gain by claiming to share paternity with the Canadian superstar.

Minaj, who has long been associated with Drake within the music industry, did not hold back while discussing the controversial topic during a recent interview. The revealing conversation shed light on her perspective regarding the rumored child and the subsequent reactions from various quarters of society.

Drake, an international icon known for his unparalleled success and chart-topping hits, has often been characterized as a charismatic ladies' man throughout his career. While this reputation has surely contributed to his status as one of music's most influential figures, it has also left him vulnerable to conjecture surrounding his personal relationships.

The Grammy-nominated rapper confessed that these reports did not come as a shock to her, considering the nature of Drake's lifestyle and the attention he garners.

Moreover, Minaj hinted at the possibility of additional individuals coming forward claiming to have children with Drake, driven by potential financial motives. With his immense wealth and popularity, the rapper has become a lucrative target for those seeking monetary compensation, exacerbating the intensity of the rumor mill surrounding his personal life.

While Minaj's insight and perspective on Drake's alleged fatherhood claims may contribute to the ongoing public discourse, it is essential to note that neither Drake nor any representative from his camp has directly addressed these rumors at this time. Consequently, we must consider that the claims remain mere speculation until verified by credible sources or official statements.

As the situation develops, the public eagerly awaits further information from all parties involved, including potential steps taken by Drake to address these allegations formally. The scrutiny surrounding the artist's personal life serves as a reminder of the challenges faced by celebrities, with their every move under public scrutiny and their privacy often compromised.

Though Minaj's comments have undoubtedly added fuel to the speculative fire, it remains to be seen whether these rumors possess any validity or will ultimately fade into the realm of idle gossip. For now, both artists continue their respective musical journeys, focusing on their careers while grappling with the personal turmoil caused by extensive media attention and public interest.

In the realm of celebrity gossip, it is important to remember the importance of accurate reporting and waiting for credible sources before drawing conclusions. As more details emerge, it is the responsibility of trusted media sources to inform the public while maintaining journalistic integrity.

Regardless of the truth surrounding Drake's alleged fatherhood, the impact of these rumors on his personal and professional life serves as a testament to the challenges faced by artists navigating the complex world of fame and fortune. Only time will tell how Drake and those around him will address and overcome these hurdles while maintaining their artistic vision and integrity in an industry that thrives on speculation and scandal."

gossipcop-5745570521,"There are reports that Taylor Swiftis trying to rekindle her relationship with ex-boyfriend Jake Gyllenhaal. OK! Magazine is reporting that the ""Wildest Dreams"" singer has been contacting her ex ever since he has been in New York City starring in the Broadway show called Sunday in the Park With George.  The tabloid is reporting that a source is saying that Taylor is the one reaching out to the actor since she feels she is now more mature than she was when they dated back in 2010.  The source said, “Taylor was so young when they dated, she wasn’t ready for a serious relationship, but now she’s showing Jake how much she’s matured. She’s excited to see where things go.”  In 2015, a rumor swirled around saying that the stars were in contact with each other, even though she was dating Calvin Harris at the time.  An unidentified source told Star magazine that, “He said he owed Taylor an apology for how things ended between them. In June, Jake ran into Cara Delevingne at The Graham Norton Show and asked for Taylor’s new number. They’ve kept in touch, albeit secretly, ever since.""  This would all be so ironic since Taylor allegedly wrote the hit song ""We Are Never Getting Back Together"" from her Red album about the relationship after her ex's friend asked her if they were giving their relationship a second chance.  “This guy walks in who is a friend of my ex’s and starts talking about how he’s heard we’re going to get back together. And that was not the case. So I start telling them the story: break up, get back together, break-up, get back together — just, ugh, the worst! And I picked up the guitar and (songwriting partner Max Martin) said, ‘This is what we’re writing,’” she once revealed to GMA.  The lyrics in the track said: ""I'm really gonna miss you picking fights / And me falling for it screaming that I'm right / And you would hide away and find your peace of mind / With some indie record that's much cooler than mine.""  In the video for the song, the actor who plays the singer's love interest gives her a scarf which many thought to be a clue that revealed the song was about Jake since she had been photographed wearing one of his scarfs while they were dating.  Since Taylor is now single and so is Jake and they both happen to be living in the same city, we don't see how this could be a problem. There is no confirmation that this is actually happening though and a source close to them told Gossip Cop that there was ""no truth"" to the report.

Leading publications, such as OK! Magazine, have shed light on the matter, revealing that the talented artist has been actively reaching out to her former beau. It appears that this reconnection began to take shape upon Gyllenhaal's arrival in New York City, where he currently stars in the distinguished Broadway production, ""Sunday in the Park With George.""

Taylor Swift, whose chart-topping hit, ""Wildest Dreams,"" resonated deeply with millions worldwide, is known to captivate listeners with her heartfelt ballads and music teeming with emotional depth. However, it seems that the songstress is now seeking to channel that emotionality into rekindling a flame from the past. Although details surrounding their estrangement remain unclear, insiders indicate that Swift's persistent efforts to connect with Gyllenhaal have been met with varying degrees of receptiveness.

While individuals possessing notable public personas often find their personal lives subjected to unrelenting scrutiny, it is crucial to approach such reports with a discerning eye. Celebrities, despite their fame and extraordinary talents, are not exempt from the complexities and intricacies that accompany human relationships. Attempting to reconcile once deeply intertwined lives demands an immense amount of courage and vulnerability, and Taylor Swift's proactive approach in this matter is a testament to her commitment and determination.

The Broadway scene, with its captivating allure and widespread recognition, offers an ideal backdrop for this rekindling affair. Gyllenhaal's portrayal in ""Sunday in the Park With George,"" hailed as a captivating masterpiece, has undoubtedly provided an opportune stage for these star-crossed individuals. The unpredictability of live theater, coupled with its emotionally charged ambiance, may offer both Swift and Gyllenhaal a platform to explore the lingering emotions and unfinished narratives that linger beneath the surface of their past.

Nonetheless, caution should be exercised when interpreting the significance of these reports. Celebrity gossip, though tantalizing and captivating, often draws attention away from the true feats and achievements of talented individuals. Taylor Swift's artistic prowess, resounding success, and remarkable philanthropic efforts rightfully demand the spotlight. It is in her music and compassionate endeavors that we find a true embodiment of her character and soul.

As the world remains captivated by the personal endeavors of fiercely talented individuals, it is essential to approach such news with both empathy and understanding. While the reports of Taylor Swift's efforts to rekindle her relationship with Jake Gyllenhaal continue to circulate, we must remain steadfast in acknowledging the entirety of her artistic journey, allowing her artistry and philanthropy to shine as beacons of inspiration."

She has allegedly been dating a mystery man for months now, and hasn’t told Brad a thing!  She’s still technically married to Brad Pitt, 52, but Angelina Jolie, 41, allegedly has her heart set on a new marriage. Barely a year after filing for divorce from her husband, Angelina is reportedly planning her fourth wedding to a wealthy, 40-something businessman and philanthropist, according to InTouch Weekly! Angelina and her handsome British guy reportedly started dating in early 2017, and has been keeping the whole relationship “very hush-hush.” That means that Brad has no idea she’s dating, let alone engaged or getting married. Uh oh!  “Angelina could tell Brad what’s going on but she’s choosing not to,” a source told InTouch. She reportedly hopes he “will be taken by complete surprise. If it makes Brad unhappy when he finds out, she’s fine with that.” She actually hasn’t even told her six kids about the alleged wedding for fear that they’ll spill the beans to their dad. Crafty!  As for the wedding itself, Angelina’s reportedly taking her closest friends and family to Cambodia, “her second home,” for a traditional Buddhist ceremony, according to the source. The wedding will allegedly take place on a wildlife reserve, wear traditional Cambodian clothing, and serve local delicacies at the reception. “Angie’s thinking of having Shiloh, Zahara, and Vivienne as bridesmaids and Maddox as the groom’s best man since Maddox sort of feels he’s the man of the family now,” the source said. Knox will allegedly be the ring bearer, and Pax will DJ and bake the cake for the reception (he did for his parents’ wedding, too!) It all sounds lovely, but how will Brad react when he finds out?

Speculation suggests that she has been discreetly dating a mysterious individual for an extended period, all while managing to keep her former partner, Brad Pitt, undoubtedly astounded and in the dark.

The news has sent shockwaves through Hollywood, leaving many to wonder about the potential consequence of this newfound romance. Angelina Jolie, a captivating figure recognized not only for her unparalleled on-screen performances but also for her relentless pursuit of humanitarian causes, has long been under the microscope of public scrutiny.

Though the identity of this allusive mystery man remains unconfirmed, questions surrounding his origins, profession, and connection to Angelina Jolie have ignited an inferno of curiosity among fans and media outlets alike.

Privacy and personal growth are essential for every individual, even those who exist under the ever-watchful lens of public scrutiny. For now, only time will reveal the truth behind these enthralling whispers, leaving fans with fervent anticipation as they yearn for an official confirmation of what could be Angelina Jolie's next chapter in love and matrimony."

gossipcop-860400,"Laura Dern in a still from Twin Peaks. Photo: Suzanne Tenner/SHOWTIME A few steps in to “Part Six”, we’re finally given some sweet relief. Not only is a cliffhanger from “Part Four” resolved, but we finally have our first look at Diane some 9,926 days after she was first mentioned in the series premiere of Twin Peaks. The moment occurs when Albert Rosenfield (Miguel Ferrer) ducks out of a rainy, cold night and heads into a sultry bar named Max Von’s, where he comes face to face with David Lynch’s longtime go-to lead, Laura Dern. Now, if you recall, the set up to this began at the end of “Part Four”, when Gordon Cole (Lynch) told Albert that, before they move ahead with their investigation into Cooper’s reappearance in South Dakota, they need to get him in front of one specific person. When Gordon asks Albert if he still knows where this person lives, he responds, “No, but I know where she drinks,” which made me think beyond the shadow of a doubt that they were talking about Sarah Palmer (Grace Zabriskie). Nope. Turns out that Special Agent Dale Cooper’s (Kyle MacLachlan) secretary, who until now has only been seen in the form of a tape recorder, enjoys a cocktail or two herself. But, let’s back up a bit, because there’s a lot to piece together here, including some newly recovered diary pages, which we’ll certainly touch upon.. “Part Six” opens where “Part Five” closed, with an increasingly bewildered Cooper standing near the cowboy statue outside the office complex that houses his workplace, Lucky 7 Insurance. A policeman patrolling the area attempts to shoo him away, but Cooper is unresponsive, tugging at the sleeve of his jacket and reaching out to touch the officer’s badge as if he’s two hours into an acid trip. The cop is nice enough to drive him home and his wife Janey (Naomi Watts) opens the door and confirms it’s her husband. Granted, the fact that she uses her husband’s full name — “That’s my husband, Dougie Jones” — is a bit odd, but the officers don’t appear phased in the slightest, likely because the night itself has been odd to say the least. Soon enough, Janey brings Cooper into the house and makes him a sandwich and even gives him a little bag of chips like he’s a child. She then insists that he go upstairs to say goodnight to his (would-be) son Sonny Jim (Pierce Gagnon), to which Cooper bumbles his way up each step and eventually sits on Sonny Jim’s bed, continuing to munch away on his bag of chips. In a classic case of Lynchian humor, Cooper offers a chip to Sonny Jim, who refuses it, citing his own clean teeth, and slowly places the chip on his cowboy-themed blanket. It’s all so perfectly ridiculous, and also a welcome reprieve from the madness — kind of like the daytime scenes in a horror movie. It doesn’t last long. Almost immediately, Janey screams for Dougie/Cooper to come back downstairs, and then shows him a file folder that had appeared on their front porch earlier, back when the cops brought him in. Inside the folder is a picture of Dougie and his sex worker pal Jade (Nafessa Williams), who he seems happy to see, saying Jade’s name out loud to an increasingly disgruntled Janey, who is sniffing and shaking like a rabid horse. Watts really shines in this role, and “Part Six” allows her to stretch her comically abrasive legs as a woman unhinged yet still in charge, a familiar archetype of Lynch’s oeuvre. As she prods her husband over Jade, Janey gets a call on their yellow kitchen phone, which is, of course, a landline because, again, what is time? It’s hard to hear exactly who’s on the other end, but Janey quickly lets us know it’s the thugs looking to collect on Dougie’s gambling debt, which has led to over $20,000 in debt. Because she’s all kinds of resilient — could you imagine running that household? — Janey agrees to meet the thugs in a nearby park at “noon 30.” It’s another strange detail that’s so oddly funny.

She then insists that he go upstairs to say goodnight to his (would-be) son Sonny Jim (Pierce Gagnon), to which Cooper bumbles his way up each step and eventually sits on Sonny Jim’s bed, continuing to munch away on his bag of chips. In a classic case of Lynchian humor, Cooper offers a chip to Sonny Jim, who refuses it, citing his own clean teeth, and slowly places the chip on his cowboy-themed blanket. It’s all so perfectly ridiculous, and also a welcome reprieve from the madness — kind of like the daytime scenes in a horror movie. It doesn’t last long. Almost immediately, Janey screams for Dougie/Cooper to come back downstairs, and then shows him a file folder that had appeared on their front porch earlier, back when the cops brought him in. Inside the folder is a picture of Dougie and his sex worker pal Jade (Nafessa Williams), who he seems happy to see, saying Jade’s name out loud to an increasingly disgruntled Janey, who is sniffing and shaking like a rabid horse. Watts really shines in this role, and “Part Six” allows her to stretch her comically abrasive legs as a woman unhinged yet still in charge, a familiar archetype of Lynch’s oeuvre. As she prods her husband over Jade, Janey gets a call on their yellow kitchen phone, which is, of course, a landline because, again, what is time? It’s hard to hear exactly who’s on the other end, but Janey quickly lets us know it’s the thugs looking to collect on Dougie’s gambling debt, which has led to over $20,000 in debt. Because she’s all kinds of resilient — could you imagine running that household? — Janey agrees to meet the thugs in a nearby park at “noon 30.” It’s another strange detail that’s so oddly funny. Following this, Janey implores Dougie/Cooper to finish his work, lest he lose his job, and leaves him with his case files. Before he attends to his work, however, Cooper looks over to see a flash message from MIKE (Al Strobel), who’s in the Red Room of the Black Lodge and feeling around in the air with his one arm as though he’s looking for a hidden window. When he sees Cooper, he pleads, “You have to wake up! You have to wake up!” and then, after a beat, he insists: “Don’t die! Don’t die!” The significance of this scene is to remind us, in case we forgot, that Cooper is trapped in the life of Dougie Jones, so that Cooper’s evil doppelgänger can remain on the loose in this time shifting earthy realm. If Cooper dies, then Evil Cooper, still under the influence of the parasitic Bob, will have free reign. After receiving this message from MIKE, Cooper goes through the claim forms he brought home from work and scribbles all over them with a pencil. He circles some things, draws what looks like a ladder, and then presses the tip of his pencil into a few heavy circles. As he’s doing this, pin points of green laser light — yes, the same green laser light that ousted Tom Sizemore’s character in “Part Five” — appear on the pages, and on his arm, as though it’s guiding what he’s doing. Now, comes the aforementioned moment, when Albert makes his way in the rain to meet someone at a place called Max Von’s Bar, whose sign looks a hell of a lot like the neon Bang Bar Bar sign hung outside of the Roadhouse in Twin Peaks.

gossipcop-2892576573,"There’s reportedly trouble in paradise at the Kardashian West house. Kim’s allegedly ready to divorce Kanye! What happened?  This is so sad! Kim Kardashian, 37, is reportedly at her wits end when it comes to dealing with husband Kanye West, 40. She’s struggled since Kanye’s terrifying November 2016 breakdown, and she reportedly can’t see a light at the end of the tunnel, according to an insider who spoke to Star Magazine. “Between his raging ego and mood swings, Kanye has been a total train wreck,” the insider alleged to the Star. “Kim is stressed enough raising two kids and getting ready for the baby without Kanye dragging her down. She’s tried to hang in there, but she just can’t take it anymore.”  Poor Kim! We can’t imagine how hard it must be to have a family member — especially your husband — go through such a huge health scare. Of course she’s stressed! If they’re truly divorcing, things are about to get crazy. She allegedly doesn’t want to make any moves until after their third baby, which they’re having via surrogate, is born. As the source says, she’s totally fine raising the little one as a single mother. She’s Kim effing Kardashian!  “[Their divorce] will be all-out war,” the insider told Star. Kim has reportedly asked Kanye to sign a “mid-nuptial agreement” to protect her assets. Factoring in their revenue, from Kanye’s music, the KUWTK empire, and Kim’s various deals, including KKW beauty, it could be a $1 billion divorce!  Don’t think she’s happy about this, though. “This decision is agony for her,” the source said. “She still loves Kanye, but their marriage may be over!” This is so sad, considering what we just learned from a source. Kim and Kanye were happily including daughter North West in the conversation about her new little sister, the source told us EXCLUSIVELY. If they’re truly having problems, then at least they’re putting on a united front for their little ones.  HollywoodLife.com has reached out to Kim’s rep for comment.

What happened? This is so sad!,"Title: Rumors Circulate as Kardashian-West Marriage Hits Rocky Waters

In an unexpected turn of events, reports have emerged suggesting that the Kardashian-West household may be facing an upheaval, with speculations of Kim Kardashian contemplating divorce from her husband, Kanye West. While the details surrounding this purported marital discord remain shrouded in uncertainty, the news has undoubtedly come as a shock to their legions of fans, who have long admired the couple's union and seemingly enviable life.

For years, Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's relationship has been a source of fascination, captivating audiences across the globe. However, recent whispers of trouble within their paradise have ignited a wave of concern and curiosity. Fans, followers, and the media alike are now consumed by questions regarding the reasons behind their alleged rift and the potential implications of a separation.

Kim Kardashian, a renowned entrepreneur, reality television star, and social media influencer, has often been heralded as the powerhouse behind the family's empire. In contrast, Kanye West, a musical genius and controversial figure, has consistently pushed boundaries with his artistic vision and creative pursuits. Together, they have formed an intriguing power couple, capturing the public's imagination with a unique blend of glamour, talent, and tabloid allure.

Despite their seemingly idyllic exterior, the Kardashian-West relationship has faced its fair share of trials and tribulations. Yet, it has always triumphed over adversity, projecting an image of solidarity and unbreakable love. However, the recent rumors of marital strain have painted a different picture, prompting a speculating public to wonder about the catalyst that may have sparked these anticipated divorce proceedings.

While no concrete information has been provided to substantiate these swirling whispers, some sources close to the couple have hinted at differences arising from Kanye West's highly-publicized battles with mental health. The pressures of fame, coupled with the demands of maintaining both personal and professional success, can undoubtedly take their toll on any relationship. It is conceivable that these external stressors may have impacted the bond that once seemed unyielding.

As fans grapple with this unexpected news, it is important to remember that these reports are based on speculation, lacking concrete evidence to validate their veracity. Nevertheless, the alleged unhappiness within the Kardashian-West household serves as a somber reminder that even the most glamorous unions are not immune to the trials and tribulations of life.

The Kardashian-West family, well-known for their affinity for privacy amidst the constant media scrutiny, has yet to release an official statement addressing the rumors. It is essential that we acknowledge the sensitivity of this situation and extend support and empathy to all parties involved. Their journey, despite its hiccups and heartaches, should serve as a reminder that relationships are complex, and true happiness requires work from both partners.

As the world collectively holds its breath, awaiting further clarification, we hope that Kim Kardashian and Kanye West can weather this storm and emerge stronger, regardless of the ultimate outcome. Only time will reveal the truth behind these troubling rumors, and until then, let us remain respectful in our speculation and reserve judgment until all the facts have emerged.

In this moment of uncertainty, it is important to offer the Kardashian-West family privacy and allow them the space to navigate these difficult waters. As the world watches, we will patiently wait for clarity on what has transpired and hope for the best for this high-profile couple."

On Oct. 23, 2017, the Los Angeles Times published a report, claiming that screenwriter and director James Toback had sexually harassed at least 38 women (via The Washington Post). According to the exposé, Toback would often explain his Hollywood reputation to women he'd meet on the street, offering them a chance to be in his next film. Then, he'd allegedly bring them to his hotel room and ask them questions about their sex lives. Some of his accusers claim he'd then rub his groin against their legs or start masturbating in front of them.  Toback, 72, has denied these allegations, stating that he'd never met the women or, if he had, he couldn't remember their interactions because their meeting ""was for five minutes."" He also claimed that it'd be ""biologically impossible"" for him to have engaged in such behavior due to the medication he was taking for both diabetes and a heart condition.  It appears that many celebrities had heard rumors of Toback's alleged behavior over the years, and, as such, they wasted no time in slamming the Bugsy writer after the Los Angeles Times article was published.

Kim, I haven’t talked to in a year,” Jenner said while discusing her memoir at the U.K.’s Cambridge Union, according to Cambridge News.  Although Kardashian West publicly supported Jenner’s journey, she cut ties after reading her book, which alleged Kris Jenner — Caitlyn’s ex-wife and Kim’s mom — knew more about her gender identity crisis than she’s admitted.  In an episode of KUWTK, the KKW Beauty mogul also revealed that she had been hurt by a chapter in the memoir in which Jenner implied that her late father Robert Kardashian thought his friend O.J. Simpson was guilty of having killed wife Nicole Brown Simpson and waiter Ron Goldman — despite having served as the NFL star’s defense attorney in his 1994 murder trial.  “My relationship with Caitlyn was strained,” the mother of three said during the episode, which aired October of last year. “I was just trying to be respectful. But if you talk about my dad, I will cut you.”  Despite their estrangement, in April of last year Kardashian West told Ellen Degeneres that she would “always love her” for helping raise her and her sisters.",1,en,"Last November, Jenner revealed she hadn’t spoken to Kim Kardashian West in a year. “To be honest, I don’t talk to [the Kardashians] anymore.","In a shocking revelation last November, Caitlyn Jenner, the renowned American television personality, activist, and former Olympian, unveiled a surprising and unexpected development in her relationship with the Kardashian clan. Jenner disclosed that she had not engaged in any form of communication with the influential socialite, Kim Kardashian West, for a prolonged period of one year. Expressing her unfiltered honesty during an interview, Jenner admitted that she no longer maintains regular contact with the Kardashian family.

This unexpected rift in Jenner's relationship with the Kardashians has sent waves of speculation throughout media circles, prompting numerous inquiries and debates surrounding the nature of their estrangement. The intricate dynamics of such a high-profile family rift have kept fans and critics alike on tenterhooks, eager to uncover the catalyst behind this surprising breakdown.

Known for her notable contributions to the field of reality television and activism, Caitlyn Jenner, formerly known as Bruce Jenner, became an integral part of the Kardashian family through her marriage to Kris Jenner, the matriarch of the Kardashian-Jenner empire. Over the years, Jenner played a prominent role in the highly popular reality show ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians,"" offering viewers a glimpse into the intriguing lives of this media-savvy family.

Jenner's unexpected revelation about her fractured relationship with Kim Kardashian West has undoubtedly raised eyebrows, leaving many to question the reasons behind their apparent silence. While speculations and rumors have been circulating, it remains unclear whether this unanticipated estrangement results from personal differences, conflicting priorities, or some undisclosed event. Nonetheless, it is clear that this apparent lack of communication between two household names, both admired and scrutinized by millions around the globe, has given rise to debates and conjecture.

Both Jenner and Kardashian West have made significant contributions to the public eye throughout their respective careers, leaving an indelible mark on society. Jenner, a beacon of transgender awareness and acceptance, has used her platform to advocate for LGBTQ+ rights, visibility, and equality. Meanwhile, Kim Kardashian West has risen to fame through her entrepreneurial endeavors, inclusive shapewear line, and dedicated activism towards criminal justice reform.

The absence of interaction between these influential figures is undoubtedly a topic of discussion for their avid followers. With rumors swirling and curiosity reaching a fever pitch, all eyes remain fixed on the Kardashian-Jenner family, awaiting further clarification or potential reconciliation in the future. As Jenner's candid revelation continues to reverberate through various media outlets, only time will tell if these two powerhouse personalities can mend the rift that has seemingly divided them.

In the whirlwind that is the world of celebrities, it is often difficult to discern the underlying factors behind their personal relationships. For now, the public remains attentive, anticipating further developments in this intriguing saga. As the days go by, it is certain that the Caitlyn Jenner-Kim Kardashian West silence will be examined closely, dissected by the curious and analyzed by the opinionated, all while the world waits in suspense for any sign of reconciliation or explanation to emerge from the apparent end of an era in their relationship."

(Photo: Patrick Breen/The Republic) For a show that feeds on exposing private affairs and personal heartbreak, the application process for ABC's ""The Bachelor"" doesn't begin to scratch the surface. Phoenix, along with 15 other cities, was chosen as a casting call site for season 23 of the hit reality-TV dating show. I volunteered to brave the high heels and nervous laughs to see what deep, personal secrets the show would be fishing for. As a full disclaimer: I’m a fan of the show. I closely watched the last season, which featured Scottsdale ""Bachelor"" Arie Luyendyk Jr. Not only is he probably the most-hated man in franchise history, but he gave a dismal showing of his hometown on America’s TV screens every Monday night. Scottsdale turned into a place to go bowling and reminisce on the old days. Nevermind that Luyendyk actually grew up in Paradise Valley. While that season was a bit of a letdown, I didn’t let it shift my belief in the process. The show, now with more spinoffs to keep track of, has captivated audiences season after season, following young hopefuls searching for love. Was I looking for love? Absolutely not. Not quite like this, at least. But I had to believe there were some women auditioning in the hopes of finding their forever life partner on a reality show.

(Photo: Elizabeth Montgomery/The Republic) I quickly befriended a young woman in the parking lot of The Scottsdale Resort at McCormick Ranch. We both had recently graduated from Arizona State University and decided to stick together through this journey. Following the trail of nicely dressed women, we wandered into a large ballroom to find what seemed like organized chaos. We were handed an application, a clipboard and a number. I was No. 72. A woman at the applications table said she expected about 200 people to filter through the resort by the end of the day. Phoenix has been a frequent destination for the show's casting calls, though few women from the Valley have been in recent seasons. Everything felt like a test. Candy placed on the application table? Avoid that. The ballroom, equipped with a DJ and an open bar, was decorated with women of all ages. Many were dressed to the nines, wearing beautiful dresses, tight fabrics and high heels. My parking-lot friend fit that description, dressed in a tube top and matching skirt with heels much taller than I could ever walk in. I was wearing a matching top-and-bottom set with bright boots and some accent jewelry. I wore an outfit that I felt matched my personality without trying too hard. Others arrived more simply in jeans and T-shirts. A young woman was dressed in a cow costume, clad with sparkly silver shoes, a bold move the producers would either applaud or completely dismiss.

(Photo: Patrick Breen/The Republic) For a show that feeds on exposing private affairs and personal heartbreak, the application process for ABC's ""The Bachelor"" doesn't begin to scratch the surface. Phoenix, along with 15 other cities, was chosen as a casting call site for season 23 of the hit reality-TV dating show. I volunteered to brave the high heels and nervous laughs to see what deep, personal secrets the show would be fishing for. As a full disclaimer: I’m a fan of the show. I closely watched the last season, which featured Scottsdale ""Bachelor"" Arie Luyendyk Jr. Not only is he probably the most-hated man in franchise history, but he gave a dismal showing of his hometown on America’s TV screens every Monday night. Scottsdale turned into a place to go bowling and reminisce on the old days. Nevermind that Luyendyk actually grew up in Paradise Valley. While that season was a bit of a letdown, I didn’t let it shift my belief in the process. The show, now with more spinoffs to keep track of, has captivated audiences season after season, following young hopefuls searching for love. Was I looking for love? Absolutely not. Not quite like this, at least. But I had to believe there were some women auditioning in the hopes of finding their forever life partner on a reality show. What's in an application Arizona Republic reporter Rebecca Smouse poses for a photograph prior to auditioning for ABC's ""The Bachelor"" at McCormick Ranch in Scottsdale on June 16, 2018. (Photo: Elizabeth Montgomery/The Republic) I quickly befriended a young woman in the parking lot of The Scottsdale Resort at McCormick Ranch. We both had recently graduated from Arizona State University and decided to stick together through this journey. Following the trail of nicely dressed women, we wandered into a large ballroom to find what seemed like organized chaos. We were handed an application, a clipboard and a number. I was No. 72. A woman at the applications table said she expected about 200 people to filter through the resort by the end of the day. Phoenix has been a frequent destination for the show's casting calls, though few women from the Valley have been in recent seasons. Everything felt like a test. Candy placed on the application table? Avoid that. The ballroom, equipped with a DJ and an open bar, was decorated with women of all ages. Many were dressed to the nines, wearing beautiful dresses, tight fabrics and high heels. My parking-lot friend fit that description, dressed in a tube top and matching skirt with heels much taller than I could ever walk in. I was wearing a matching top-and-bottom set with bright boots and some accent jewelry. I wore an outfit that I felt matched my personality without trying too hard. Others arrived more simply in jeans and T-shirts. A young woman was dressed in a cow costume, clad with sparkly silver shoes, a bold move the producers would either applaud or completely dismiss. Angelie Meehan, of Phoenix, wears a cow costume to her audition for ABC's ""The Bachelor"" at McCormick Ranch in Scottsdale on June 16, 2018. She said she was looking for ""that special bull for her life.""

What have you not found yet but would like in a relationship? There were also several questions on prior relationships and marriages. The application explicitly asked if we drank alcohol, only to follow up with the next logical question: What's your favorite drink? My newfound friend had issues with some of the questions, like what our salary was and what was on our bucket list. We both skipped the question asking if we had any interesting talents. The application was coupled with an intense release to agree to everything the producers may do if you get picked for the show. It felt like we were signing our life away, a thought that resonated with many of the applicants sitting around us. All in the name of love, though. Interestingly enough, most people I spoke with who were auditioning had not watched the show before. It seemed strange to me to audition for a process they had never seen on TV before. This would be like someone trying out for ""Survivor"" not knowing you will be trapped on a deserted island. To make it on the show, you must be 21 or older, be single and can't have been convicted of a felony. You also can't be running for any type of political office.

We sat as a small group outside, waiting for our names to be called. I made a new friend, who told me she reluctantly agreed to audition after a friend worried about her love life drove her to the resort. She said her friend even tweeted photos to the producers of the show to get their attention. The empty room was daunting, but the woman behind the camera was kind. She'd been through her fair share of casting calls before"

Last week, pictures surfaced on TMZ that showed Mrs. Kelly, the new face of NBC, on the Los Angeles set of “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” after conducting a lengthy interview with Kris Jenner and all of her daughters – Kendall and Kylie Jenner, and Kourtney, Kim, and Khloé Kardashian.  It was made known that Caitlyn Jenner and Rob Kardashian had opted to skip the chitchat and for obvious reasons, Blac Chyna and Tyga were not invited.  As for Kanye West being absent, no explanation was given – as the saying goes, Kanye does what Kanye wants.  The retired Olympic gold medal-winning decathlete, who is currently promoting her new memoir, “The Secrets of My Life,” is embroiled in a nasty fight with ex-wife, Kris Jenner, and is said to be allergic to all things Kardashian.

She knows they aren’t going to say nice things about her, so why subject herself to the insults.”  The tipster went on to explain that the 67-year-old television personality is upset that her daughters – Kendall and Kylie – took part in the charade.

In a surprising turn of events, revered public figure Caitlyn Jenner has decided to take a stand and gracefully decline the opportunity to witness Megyn Kelly's upcoming interview with the renowned Kardashian and Jenner families. Scheduled to air in June, this highly-anticipated event has garnered significant attention worldwide, but Jenner has chosen to distance herself from the forthcoming spectacle.

Formerly known as Bruce Jenner, the Olympic gold medalist has resolutely voiced her decision against participating in this media affair, citing personal reasons that remain undisclosed. With her well-established stance as a transgender rights advocate and a prominent member of the Kardashian-Jenner clan, Jenner's choice not to engage in this televised event signifies a depth of conviction and individuality that has become characteristic of her public persona.

While many eagerly await the in-depth revelations and candid discussions that this interview promises, it appears that Jenner has taken a distinctive path, steering clear of the media frenzy that often accompanies such high-profile occasions. Undoubtedly, her refusal to partake in this televised encounter will leave fans and spectators alike inquisitive, intrigued, and speculating about the motivations behind her decision.

While some may question Jenner's choice to abstain from the interview, it is essential to respect her autonomy and acknowledge her steadfast commitment to personal values and beliefs. Over the years, she has consistently demonstrated her capacity to navigate her own narrative, emboldening others to embrace their identity and advocate for their own unique perspectives.

As the world gears up for Megyn Kelly's captivating interview, it is undeniable that the absence of Caitlyn Jenner will leave an indelible void within this high-profile gathering of influential personalities. However, it is also a reminder that Jenner, an accomplished woman of considerable influence, forges her own path, inspiring millions around the globe in developing the courage to embrace their own truths while staying true to themselves.

As we await the forthcoming interview, it is evident that Caitlyn Jenner's notable absence serves to shed light on the importance of individuality, autonomy, and the resolute pursuit of personal convictions."

On last Sunday’s BET awards, it was quite clear that Jay-Z and Beyonce were not buddy, buddy with Kim Kardashian. In fact, the camera caught Jay barely acknowledge Kim when he was going on stage to accept his award with Kanye West. Since Jay and Kanye are not only music collaborators but close friends, will “Kimye” stand a chance?  Unfortunately, Kim cannot make Kanye’s friends like her. It will be Kanye’s responsibility to lay the law down with his buddies. He must let it be known that high school bully behavior toward his girlfriend is unacceptable.  If his friends continue to snub her, then the rap star will have to distance himself from his friends until they realize he and Kim are a package deal.  Although Jay-Z and Beyonce have preconceived notions of what Kim and the Kardashians are all about, they do not actually know who Kim is.  If they take off their judgmental glasses, they may even come to like her or at least tolerate her in their group.  Remember, if a friend is happy with their new significant other, don’t hate.

Or can friends “kill” a love affair?","Title: The Potential Influences of Jay-Z and Beyoncé on Kimye's Long-Term Relationship

In the realm of celebrity relationships, the seemingly perfect union of power couple Kim Kardashian-West and Kanye West, famously known as Kimye, has often served as captivating gossip fodder. Their love story has been one filled with ups and downs, triumphs and controversies, but a recent development has thrown their long-term prospects into question. The emotional temperature between Kimye and Kanye's close friends, Jay-Z and Beyoncé, seems to be plunging, raising concerns about the impact friends can have on romantic relationships.

The power couple dynamics within the entertainment industry are no stranger to scrutiny. As the world closely follows their every move, it becomes apparent that maintaining a strong support system is crucial for lasting love. Jay-Z and Beyoncé have been iconic pillars of Kanye West's life, an inseparable trifecta that has conquered the music industry together. However, recent tensions between Kim Kardashian-West and the beloved duo have brought forth questions about the future of Kimye.

For years, Jay-Z and Beyoncé have been the epitome of what genuine friendship entails. Their influence on Kanye's life has been immense, inspiring art, success, and even addressing personal struggles. Yet, whispers of discord reverberating through the entertainment grapevine suggest that Jay-Z and Beyoncé appear to be withholding vital emotional support from Kim Kardashian-West.

The ""cold shoulder"" supposedly shown by Jay-Z and Beyoncé toward Kim is causing concern among their fans and tabloid followers. But can friendships truly have the power to ""kill"" a love affair? Experts argue that friendship dynamics have immense influence upon the longevity and stability of romantic relationships.

Research has shown that friends play a significant role in shaping individuals' decisions, behaviors, and emotions. As an integral part of one's support system, friends can become the backbone of a relationship, providing a shoulder to lean on and helping weather the inevitable storms of life. Should such support wane, the impact can be profound, with consequences extending far beyond the immediate couple involved.

The strength of Kimye's bond has remained unyielding through numerous public controversies. However, the continued disconnection between Kim Kardashian-West and her husband's cherished friends may pose a formidable threat. Psychologists reveal that solid relationships require a well-rounded network of social connections, as a lack thereof can create a void that strains the core relationship's wellbeing.

It is crucial to emphasize that the alleged tension between Kimye and Jay-Z and Beyoncé remains a matter of speculation. Celebrity relationships are often subject to intense scrutiny, and the truth is often obscured behind tabloid headlines and public facades. However, based on psychological theory, the potential consequences of friends seemingly giving the cold shoulder cannot be easily dismissed.

For Kimye to defy the odds and prove that love can withstand the challenges orchestrated by external influences, the couple must confront this hurdle head-on. Open lines of communication, empathy, and a willingness to address any misunderstandings are paramount in emerging stronger from this situation.

Only time will reveal the true nature of the relationship between Kim Kardashian-West and Kanye West, and how their bond withstands the current strain. Whether or not Jay-Z and Beyoncé's alleged frosty attitude will have a long-lasting impact on the couple's dynamic remains to be seen. However, it is undeniable that friendship dynamics play a substantial role in shaping the longevity and overall health of the romantic relationships they intersect with."

It wasn’t so bad on the scale of celebrity breakups, but after less than three years of marriage (a lifetime in Hollywood), it was a tabloid downer for a day or two.  In case there are still people busying themselves wondering if Aniston is happy (just a note, she really doesn’t want you to), please stop. According to the latest tabloid reports, she’s doing just fine. She’s reportedly back on the dating scene with two different beaus, per Us Weekly, and her friends are having trouble not talking about it. One man is reportedly a bachelor who recently split from his wife and the other is an “industry creative,” whatever that ever means. Neither of them is an actor.  But there’s no reason to believe we’ll learn more anytime soon. In July of 2016, Aniston wrote a pretty searing op-ed for HuffPost in which she scolded paparazzi that are constantly obsessed with whether she’s in love or having babies.  “For the record, I am not pregnant,” she wrote then. “What I am is fed up. I’m fed up with the sport-like scrutiny and body-shaming that occurs daily under the guise of ‘journalism,’ the ‘First Amendment,’ and ‘celebrity news.’”  O.K., so, Jennifer Aniston is happy. She’s dating. This is great. Now time to leave her alone and talk about the fact that Justin Theroux knows someone in the South of France with a really great hot tub.

The news of their heartbreaking split has sent shockwaves through the entertainment industry, leaving fans and admirers alike questioning the fragility of love in the fast-paced world of fame and fortune. Amidst the glamorous facade associated with their lives, it appears that even the strongest of unions can succumb to the pressures of a demanding public spotlight.

Jennifer Aniston, renowned for her iconic role as the beloved Rachel Green in the hit television series ""Friends,"" and Justin Theroux, a renowned actor and screenwriter, shared an undeniable chemistry that captured the hearts of many. Their love story blossomed on the sets of the comedy film ""Tropic Thunder,"" eventually culminating in a secret backyard wedding ceremony in 2015.

The picturesque midcentury home, which served as a testament to their shared taste and commitment to intellectual aesthetics, was unveiled to the world in a captivating spread published by Architectural Digest. Adorned with tastefully curated art pieces, vintage furniture, and a seamless blend of midcentury charm with modern design, their home became a symbol of their love, creativity, and attention to detail.

However, as life often proves, appearances can be deceiving. The stunning revelation of their parting ways has sent ripples of sadness and disappointment across the global fan base. The seemingly ideal marriage, which garnered equal amounts of envy and admiration, has now become a cautionary tale of love's impermanence.

Sources close to the couple state that despite their best efforts to navigate the challenging waters of fame and personal fulfillment, irreconcilable differences emerged, forcing them to embrace separate paths. A shared commitment to private lives, the duo had always taken great care to shield their relationship from the prying eyes of the media, which makes this sudden announcement all the more perplexing.

While the world reels from the news of their split, there is an undeniable admiration for the candor with which Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux disclosed their separation. In a joint statement, the couple emphasized their mutual love and respect while acknowledging their intention to redefine their relationship and embrace new chapters separately.

As we bid farewell to another high-profile romance, the world remains uncertain about what the future holds for these two talented individuals. With their unique gifts and unwavering determination, both Aniston and Theroux embark on distinct paths, leaving behind a legacy of art, laughter, and fond memories etched forever within the walls of their midcentury paradise.

The captivating images of their Los Angeles home, immortalized in the pages of Architectural Digest, serve as a lasting testament to the love and creativity they once shared. While their lives may have diverged, the world will always remember the moments of joy and admiration that their union brought, forever enshrined in the annals of Hollywood's rich history."

Their young and passionate love affair seemed destined to withstand the tests of time.

However, like any relationship, the Jelena saga faced its challenges and hardships. The pressures of fame, personal struggles, and the constant scrutiny of their every move eventually took a toll on this iconic couple. Amidst turbulent breakups, heart-rending songs, and countless headlines, their relationship became an emotional roller-coaster that kept the world on edge.

Yet, no matter the obstacles or trials they faced, the duo managed to find their way back to one another repeatedly. Their magnetic pull transcended the barriers of logic, leaving fans mystified and yearning for more. Believers and Selenators faithfully rooted for their reunion, keeping the Jelena flame flickering throughout the years.

But now, as the dust settles on their most recent chapter, questions arise. Has the final bell tolled for Jelena? Are we witnessing the end of an era filled with love, uncertainty, and speculation?

With Bieber's recent marriage to model Hailey Baldwin, and Gomez's personal pursuit of growth and self-discovery, fans are left wondering if the Jelena timeline has truly come to an end. As gossip columns buzz with whispers of new love interests and individual pursuits, uncertainty looms over the future of this cherished period in pop culture history.

While it is impossible to predict the future, the undeniable truth remains that the Jelena timeline has played an integral role in shaping the lives and careers of both Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez. It has been a journey drenched in passion, turbulence, and profound connection that has left an indelible mark on their hearts and the public consciousness.

As we reflect on these seven tumultuous years, we cannot help but recognize the immense influence Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez have had on one another's lives. Whether this is truly the end of their captivating tale or merely a pause in the story, the Jelena timeline will forever be etched in the annals of celebrity romance.

Like any relationship, fascination, and speculation will undoubtedly persist. For now, we can only wait with bated breath and discover what the future holds for two individuals who have shared an extraordinary journey—one that has united fans, broken hearts, and solidified their status as icons of our generation."
gossipcop-2388806885,"R. Kelly’s time may have finally come. R. Kelly has been accused of sexual relationships with minors going back to 1994, when he married 15-year-old pop star Aaliyah. (The marriage was annulled.) In the 24 years since then, he has been sued multiple times for inappropriate sexual contact with a minor (he settled out of court every time), and he was eventually charged with creating child pornography. (A jury found him not guilty on the grounds that they could not conclusively identify the other figure in his infamous sex tape as a child.) Last summer, he was accused of creating an abusive “sex cult” of very young women, whom he allegedly isolates, brainwashes, and abuses physically and emotionally. Since the story broke, multiple women have added their own testimonies of abuse at R. Kelly’s hands. (Through a lawyer, Kelly denied all accusations, saying he would “work diligently and forcibly to pursue his accusers and clear his name.”) And in April, another woman accused Kelly of “knowingly and intentionally infecting her with an STD.” Her lawyers say they are currently preparing a federal civil lawsuit. Through a spokesperson, Kelly issued a statement to the Washington Post in which he “categorically denies all claims and allegations.” As man after man has fallen to the #MeToo reckoning, losing jobs and retiring from public life after being accused of sexual harassment and assault, there’s been a recurring whisper: What about R. Kelly? Despite decades of lawsuits and allegations, Kelly’s career has marched steadily on. Last year, he finished an arena tour with a few cancellations. This year, he’s touring with singer Charlie Wilson (some protests are planned). His music appeared in Pitch Perfect 3. At this year’s Coachella, rapper Vince Staples repeatedly referred to Kelly as a “child molester” in an interview with Complex, insisting, “He pees on people.” In our post-#MeToo, post-Time’s Up, post-Harvey Weinstein world, and given the sheer volume of allegations against Kelly, it seems reasonable to raise the question of why he continues to work as much as he does. But Staples’s interviewer only giggled nervously and protested, “We can’t ever talk about this guy. ... You’re about to get me fired from Coachella. It’s my first time here.” Later, Staples tweeted that “R. Kelly people is looking for me.” ladies and gentlemen, vince staples on r kelly pic.twitter.com/SmZdYu9PNJ — andy (@aboynamedandy) April 16, 2018 That stasis may be starting to change. Most of the claims against Kelly were reiterated in a recent BBC Three documentary, R Kelly: Sex, Girls & Videotapes. And over the past year, at least five members of Kelly’s inner circle have left him. His assistant, his accountant, his lawyer, and his rep have all said that they no longer work for him, although none of them have gone into detail about their departures and all have been supportive and complimentary toward Kelly in their statements. His longtime musical accompanist, DJ Phantom, was less circumspect about his decision to leave Kelly in December: “I didn’t know then what I know now,” he said. “He’s a shitbag.” In April, the Women of Color committee within Time’s Up threw its weight behind the #MuteRKelly campaign, calling for anyone currently profiting from Kelly and his music to drop him, including Spotify, Ticketmaster, and Kelly’s record label, RCA. Shortly thereafter, Spotify announced that it would no longer be promoting Kelly’s music, although his music would remain in their streaming catalog. It’s possible that these new developlments mean things are changing for Kelly, and that he’s about to face lasting consequences for those accusations. But if that’s the case, those consequences took more than two decades to reach him. There is a persistent vagueness to the way we talk about R. Kelly that makes it possible to forget exactly what he’s been accused of, how often he’s been accused, and how much proof there is against him. And most likely, that’s because his alleg",1,en,"R. Kelly’s time may have finally come. R. Kelly has been accused of sexual relationships with minors going back to 1994, when he married 15-year-old pop star Aaliyah.","R. Kelly's Alleged Decades-long Pattern of Sexual Misconduct with Minors Comes to Light

In a shocking turn of events, celebrated R&B artist R. Kelly finds himself at the center of a scandalous controversy that may potentially bring his career to a grinding halt. Accusations of engaging in sexual relationships with underage girls have haunted the singer for years, but the latest revelation suggests that his alleged misconduct stretches back as far as 1994, when he reportedly married the late pop star Aaliyah, who was just 15 years old at the time.

The disturbing allegations have resurfaced, casting a dark cloud over R. Kelly's reputation, which once seemed unbreakable. With corroborating evidence, witnesses, and victims stepping forward, the artist's long-held secrets may finally be exposed to the glare of public scrutiny and legal consequences.

Throughout a glittering career spanning several decades, R. Kelly has crafted numerous chart-topping hits and influenced a generation of musicians. But his musical genius has occasionally been overshadowed by speculation surrounding his relationships with underage girls.

Over the years, stories have circulated of the singer's penchant for young girls, with allegations pointing to a disturbing pattern of behavior. However, now, the gravity and credibility of these accusations have reached an unprecedented level, likely leaving a profound impact on R. Kelly's legacy and the industry as a whole.

This latest accusation, concerning his alleged marriage to Aaliyah when she was only 15, is particularly disconcerting. It suggests a deep-seated and longstanding pattern of exploitation and abuse, a narrative that has already sent shockwaves through the entertainment community.

In response, activist groups and authorities are ramping up efforts to thoroughly investigate these sensational accusations. Task forces have been formed, and legal proceedings are expected to follow. Given the weight of the evidence presented against him, R. Kelly's time in the spotlight may finally be coming to an end.

As the legal process unfolds, the music industry faces a reckoning. Society as a whole must confront the deeply ingrained issues surrounding the treatment of women and girls, particularly in a male-dominated business like entertainment. The allegations against R. Kelly serve as a stark reminder that  justice should not be swayed by an individual's fame or achievements.

While R. Kelly may have evaded significant consequences in the past, this time, it appears that his luck has run out. The floodgates have opened, and his alleged victims, fuelled by a burgeoning #MeToo movement, are stepping forward to demand justice. Will this moment mark a turning point, ushering in a new era where the powerful and influential are held accountable for their actions? Only time will tell."

gossipcop-7489249320,"Mark Wahlberg has come a long way from his Funky Bunch days. The successful actor has an important message for anti-Trump celebrities.  While being interviewed for Task & Purpose for his new movie “Patriots Day,” Wahlberg went after celebrities who “lined up to denounce Donald Trump is the months and weeks leading up to Election Day.”  “A lot of celebrities did, do, and shouldn’t,” he told the magazine. “You know, it just goes to show you that people aren’t listening to that anyways. They might buy your CD or watch your movie, but you don’t put food on their table. You don’t pay their bills.”  “A lot of Hollywood is living in a bubble,” Wahlberg continued. “They’re pretty out of touch with the common person, the everyday guy out there providing for their family. Me, I’m very aware of the real world. I come from the real world and I exist in the real world. And although I can navigate Hollywood and I love the business and the opportunities it’s afforded me, I also understand what it’s like not to have all that.”  Wahlberg’s point is well taken. What makes Hollywood liberals qualified to speak on politics? They should have respect for the President of the United States.  Do you agree?",1,en,Mark Wahlberg has come a long way from his Funky Bunch days. The successful actor has an important message for anti-Trump celebrities.,"TITLE: Mark Wahlberg Urges Anti-Trump Celebrities to Prioritize Unity over Politics

Renowned actor Mark Wahlberg, widely acknowledged for his successful transition from his early renowned musical career as a member of the Funky Bunch, has emerged as a prominent voice in Hollywood. The multi-talented entertainer has recently taken a stand, urging fellow celebrities critical of President Donald Trump to embrace unity and focus on bridging divides rather than perpetuating political polarization.

In a series of thought-provoking statements, Wahlberg commanded attention as he spotlighted the importance of setting aside personal political beliefs in order to foster a more reconciliatory atmosphere for the betterment of society as a whole. Respected for his level-headedness and integrity, Wahlberg's message keenly resonated during these challenging times when divisions have threatened to drive communities apart.

Recognizing the increasingly divisive rhetoric permeating the entertainment industry, Wahlberg encouraged his peers to re-evaluate their approach to engaging with those who hold differing political opinions. The celebrated actor firmly believes that it is within their reach to transcend ideological barriers and lead by example, paving the way towards constructive dialogue and productive cooperation.

Drawing from his own experiences, Wahlberg highlighted the transformative power of personal growth, asserting that he too had come a long way from his Funky Bunch heydays. The actor's humble beginnings and subsequent rise to stardom fostered a profound understanding of the importance of humility and compassion—values he now urges his fellow celebrities to embrace.

Moreover, Wahlberg emphasized the significance of utilizing one's platform responsibly, suggesting that vocal opposition for the sake of polarization inadvertently reinforces societal divisions. Instead, he advocated for a shift towards fostering a collective environment conducive to constructive engagement, where diverse perspectives can be respected and understood.

While ensuring he acknowledged the right to express dissenting opinions, Wahlberg urged anti-Trump celebrities to remain open-minded, embrace empathy, and work together towards finding common ground. By directing efforts towards fostering unity and mutual understanding, he argued, Hollywood figures could play a pivotal role in healing fractured communities across the nation.

Wahlberg's poignant message has reverberated throughout the entertainment industry as his humble and thoughtful approach resonates with those who recognize the pressing need to move past partisan politics. With his own impressive journey as a testament to personal transformation and self-improvement, the actor's words hold extra weight and are beginning to kindle widespread discussion among celebrities grappling with their role in an increasingly divided society.

In the end, Wahlberg's impassioned appeal serves as a powerful reminder that our collective responsibility for fostering unity should never be overshadowed by political disagreements. As we navigate the complexities of our world today, his call to action invites all celebrities and public figures to transcend their political biases, embrace empathy, and actively work towards a more inclusive and harmonious society."

GWYNETH PALTROW: I was trying to remember when we first met, but I’m afraid I can’t.  PENÉLOPE CRUZ: We had lunch at Madeo in Los Angeles. We were alone and talking about our deepest secrets, as if we had known each other for 20 years. It was around the time I was doing All the Pretty Horses [2000].  PALTROW: Wow. We’ve been friends for a long time. We’ve been through so much together.  CRUZ: And even though we live so far away and don’t spend nearly enough time together, when I see you, it’s like it was only yesterday.  PALTROW: I was thinking the other day about how you used to study dance. Was your goal to become â¨a ballerina?  CRUZ: That’s what I wanted as a little girl. By the time I went to ballet school at age 4, I was already asking to play the role of Carmen. I didn’t realize then that the reason I liked dancing was because it was just another form of acting. I was hard-core, training something like five hours a day, six days a week. But when I did my first movie, when I was around 17, I just fell in love with acting. That’s when I stopped dancing.  PALTROW: Do you miss it?  CRUZ: I miss the freedom I felt when I was dancing. I remember it as some kind of trance. I imagine singing is like that for you. You have such an amazing voice.  PALTROW: It’s totally like that. How did you get your first job?  CRUZ: I got an agent when I was 15, and she sent me to a casting for Jamón Jamón [1992]. And I got the job. For both Javier and I, that was the movie that actually started both our careers.  PALTROW: You were 17 when you did that?  CRUZ: I think I was, but I was lying so much about my age that I can’t be sure.  PALTROW: Most actresses try to make themselves younger, but you were making yourself older.  CRUZ: I’ve spent most of my career trying to make myself older, for different reasons. Journalists have been asking me, since I was, like, 22, “Are you afraid of aging?” That is such a crazy question for a 22-year-old girl or, for that matter, for a 42-year-old. I combat that craziness by refusing to answer the question.  PALTROW: It’s amazing, Hollywood’s obsession with the aging of women. And how much scrutiny we get for being whatever age we are.  CRUZ: My mom worked very hard to raise us, as did my dad, without bullshit. I’ve always had a real sense of rootedness in family and reality. It’s not like I’m proud of the values I have, because I don’t feel like they’re up to me—they just come from the way I was raised. I’m rooted by the things I’ve seen in my mom, the things I admire in her. And in my father. When it comes to talking about aging as an actress, I feel like, “What the fuck? I’m not going to give you even two minutes to honor your question. It doesn’t deserve that.” Something changed when I gave birth to my daughter. I started thinking, “Come on, it’s 2017.

gossipcop-955765,"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle ‘Found Each Other to Change the World,’ Nacho Figueras Says  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s romance is one for the ages, according to their pal Nacho Figueras. The Argentine polo star, who appeared alongside the couple at the 2018 Sentebale ISPS Handa Polo Cup on Thursday, July 26, raved about the couple on Instagram and Twitter after the match, saying their love story serves a greater purpose.  “This girl really rocks. The more I know you, the more I am convinced that you both found each other to change the world,” he captioned a photo of himself presenting a trophy to the Duchess of Sussex. “Let’s push the envelope!! Let’s make the world a better place.”  Figueras, who is also a Ralph Lauren model, was on Harry’s team — the winning team — at Thursday’s match for Sentebale, an organization founded by the Duke of Sussex and Prince Seeiso of Lesotho. Sentebale aims to “become the leading organization in the provision of psychosocial support for children living with HIV in Southern Africa,” according to its website.  Thursday’s match raised more than £1 million for the charity. “@sentebale currently reaches nearly 4,000 young people a year with our unique programme of psychosocial support, so they can live long, happy, healthy lives,” Figueras captioned another photo. On a throwback pic of himself with Harry, he added that it was “an honor to be the captain of the @stregishotels Polo Team playing with this great man for a great cause.”  Figueras made headlines earlier this week when a photo of him with the royal couple went viral and sparked a series of memes. The image showed Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan celebrating his team’s victory with a kiss, as Figueras stood next to them awkwardly, trying to hand them the trophy.

Here’s how the Biebs is coping with his time apart from Sel.  Justin Bieber, 24, is going through a tough time as his relationship with Selena Gomez, 25, is on pause. She’s currently on vacation with friends in Sydney, Australia, where she appears to be carefree in this new video. However, a source reveals that the same can’t be said for Bieber. “Justin has Selena on the brain constantly. He is trying to drown it out by hanging with friends and doing stuff on his own time but he keeps thinking about her,” a source EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com. “He always wants to be around her, talk to her and be with her. She is like a drug for him, he just needs more and more and more.”  As the Biebs continues to struggle with their time apart, he’s got a few things up his sleeve for when she returns to LA. “He can’t wait until she is back because he wants to really wine and dine her upon her return and really kick start the relationship back up again,” the insider reveals. It’s unclear when Sel is scheduled to return to the West Coast. But, as seen on her Instagram, she is having the time of her life. She posted a video which showed her laughing on a boat, accompanied by a subliminal message, that she “chose” to take care of herself, “not to prove anything to anyone.” Was she trying to give us insight into her most recent split with Bieber?  Jelena fans went into panic mode after seeing Sel in the arms of another man on a boat on March 19. She was photographed hugging and goofing off in photos with Sydney native, Johnny Rays. While all signs point to a friendship between the two, the photos didn’t appear that way to some fans who claimed they looked too close for comfort.  While Sel has been vacationing Down Under, Bieber has been staying active. He’s been photographed playing hockey and soccer with friends. However, his emotions may be getting the best of him as he took a gnarly fall during a soccer game on March 19, and seemingly broke down on the sidelines of a hockey game on March 17.  As you may recall, Jelena reunited in October 2017, after her split with The Weeknd, 28. They seemed inseparable, having spent New Year’s together in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. However, their romance took a rocky turn around Bieber’s birthday on March 1, according to reports.",1,en,"Justin Bieber’s struggling with his split from Selena Gomez as she’s all smiles on her Australian vacation, a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.","Justin Bieber's Struggles with Recent Breakup Highlighted as Selena Gomez Radiates Happiness during Australian Getaway

In the tumultuous world of celebrity relationships, the recent split between Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez has continued to captivate the attention of fans worldwide. As the young heartthrob grapples with the aftermath of their separation, an exclusive source close to the situation has revealed the emotional toll it has taken on him, providing insight into his ongoing struggle.

According to a highly reliable and exclusive source who spoke to HollywoodLife.com, Justin Bieber is currently grappling with the effects of his recent breakup from Selena Gomez. The Canadian singer, who rose to fame at a tender age, has had his fair share of ups and downs when it comes to matters of the heart. However, the separation from Gomez appears to have hit him particularly hard, as he navigates the complex emotions the split has brought forth.

Meanwhile, as the ""Sorry"" singer battles his internal turmoil, Selena Gomez has embarked on a seemingly carefree Australian vacation. Photographs documenting her getaway depict a smile that radiates contentment and liberation, contrasting with Bieber's evident struggles. The pop starlet, known for her powerful music and unwavering strength, seems to have effortlessly transitioned into a more positive chapter in her life, far removed from the shared tumultuous history with Bieber.

The source close to HollywoodLife.com, choosing to remain anonymous, highlighted Bieber's difficulties in coping with the ending of their relationship. The insider revealed that the young musician has been ruminating on the memories shared with Gomez. With emotions running high, the heartache stemming from the breakup has been intensified by the belief that Gomez has seemingly moved on effortlessly.

Such struggles are not uncommon in the realm of celebrity relationships, as these individuals are prone to living their personal lives under a glaring spotlight. However, Justin Bieber's visible difficulty in grappling with the split emphasizes the depth of emotions involved. The source emphasizes that the break seems to have struck a sensitive chord within Bieber, leaving him in a state of emotional vulnerability.

It is important to note that relationships, especially those in the public eye, are multifaceted and complex. True insight into the inner workings of celebrity partnerships is often known solely to those involved. While Justin Bieber's struggles in the wake of his breakup with Selena Gomez are apparent, it is crucial to respect the privacy of both parties during this vulnerable time.

As Bieber's fans rally around him with messages of support, the path to healing remains uncertain. In the midst of his personal struggles, it is our sincere hope that the young musician finds solace and strength to navigate the challenges that lie ahead."

While these women were already rich before they became Real Housewives, it's remarkable how much wealth they were able to generate through their fame. But with great wealth comes great responsibility. Because like other forms of entertainment, reality television can break you just as quickly as it can make you. According to the website Celebrity Net Worth, most of the Real Housewives are doing OK, while an unfortunate few have entered the red since joining the franchise.

While these women were already rich before they became Real Housewives, it's remarkable how much wealth they were able to generate through their fame.","Title: Real Housewives: How Celebrity Status Transforms Wealth for the Rich and Famous

Intro:
In the glamorous world of celebrities, opulence and fame have long been known to go hand in hand. However, a recent analysis has shed light on the remarkable wealth accumulation experienced by a group of influential women who, as if by some magnetic force, transformed their existing fortunes into staggering fortunes. The stars of the hit reality TV show, Real Housewives, were already affluent before they embarked on their journeys to fame, but their subsequent rise to the ranks of super-celebrities has propelled their wealth to unprecedented heights. Let us unravel the astounding financial success these women have achieved through their newfound fame.

Body:
The Real Housewives franchise, renowned for its captivating blend of intrigue, luxury, and drama, showcases the lives of affluent women across the globe. These enterprising ladies, possessing already substantial wealth, have leveraged their newfound celebrity status to amass fortunes that would make even the most successful entrepreneurs envious.

First in this roster of extraordinary women is the internationally acclaimed entrepreneur and reality star, Bethenny Frankel. Hailing from the incomparable city of New York, Frankel presented herself as a savvy businesswoman with a strong entrepreneurial spirit. Before her rise to fame, Frankel had already amassed considerable wealth as a chef, author, and founder of the Skinnygirl brand. However, her debut on The Real Housewives of New York City propelled her to a whole new level of financial success. Thanks to her meticulous branding efforts and shrewd business acumen, Forbes now estimates Frankel's net worth to be a jaw-dropping $70 million.

Moving further, we encounter Lisa Vanderpump, the epitome of sophistication and luxury. Vanderpump, a British restaurateur and television personality, joined the cast of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills with a well-established foothold in the dining industry. However, her on-screen persona and captivating charm multiplied her commercial ventures. Today, Vanderpump has turned her exquisite taste and business acumen into a flourishing restaurant empire, a net worth of $75 million, and widespread admiration as a prominent philanthropist.

The captivating and charismatic NeNe Leakes, an Atlanta-based actress and television personality, provides another astonishing example of this phenomenon. Leakes burst onto the reality TV scene as a standout cast member on The Real Housewives of Atlanta, using her larger-than-life personality and memorable catchphrases to capture the attention of viewers worldwide. Riding the wave of fame, Leakes diversified her endeavors and expanded her empire to include successful business ventures, authoring best-selling books, and starring in numerous television shows. With an estimated net worth now surpassing $14 million, Leakes stands as a remarkable testament to the financial prospects of Real Housewives turned global influencers.

Conclusion:
The Real Housewives phenomenon has not merely been a journey of elevated egos and captivating storylines; it has been a catalyst for tremendous financial success. The remarkable wealth these women were able to generate alongside their existing affluence underscores the symbiotic relationship between fame, fortune, and the insatiable appetite of audiences craving a glimpse into the lives of the privileged few.

As these women continue to grace our screens, it is increasingly evident that the Real Housewives franchise represents more than a simple glimpse into excessive lifestyles. Rather, it serves as a testament to the incredible financial opportunities that await those fortunate enough to join the ranks of the rich and famous.

gossipcop-28284230,"Not so fast! Madonna was hit with a series of “uncomfortable questions” by a judge before she was granted permission to adopt her 4-year-old twin girls from Malawi, the presiding judge said in court documents obtained by The Associated Press on Wednesday, February 8.  “The petitioner is a professional performer and I guarded myself against the danger of her merely reciting a well-rehearsed speech by asking her some rather uncomfortable questions to which she gave very candid answers,” Judge Fiona Mwale said in her ruling, explaining her reasons for approving the adoption.  After pressing Madonna, 58, to explain her intentions in adding two more little ones to her brood of four, Judge Mwale said she was satisfied that the girls would be in good hands with the Material Girl.  “There is no doubt that the petitioner can offer the infants not only the best education money can buy, but also guidance with a high likelihood of ensuring that the two infants grow to be self-sufficient adults,” Judge Mwale said, adding that she is satisfied that Madonna “is motivated by her desire to offer a home, love, protection and guidance to the infants.”  In the court documents, Judge Mwale addressed prior controversies surrounding Madonna’s adoptions in Malawi. “In determining her motives, I questioned the petitioner at length about the impact of her decision which could be construed as robbing Malawi of its most precious resource, its children,” the judge wrote.  As previously reported, Madonna filed for adoption in High Court in Malawi on January 25 but tried to keep the process under wraps until a final decision was made. (The Queen of Pop issued a statement denying her adoption to Us Weekly that same day, claiming that she was in Malawi “to check on the children’s hospital in Blantyre.”) According to the AP, she has already raised $7.5 million for a pediatric surgery ward at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, which is set to open early next year.  Madonna previously adopted son David and daughter Mercy James, both 11, from Malawi in 2008 and 2009, respectively. She is also mom to daughter Lourdes, 20, whom she shares with ex Carlos Leon, and son Rocco, 16, whom she shares with ex-husband Guy Ritchie.  Madonna’s twin girls will retain their birth names as a part of an effort to preserve their identity as Malawian nationals, the court documents said, and their father was at the January 25 court hearing with Madonna. (The twins’ mother died within a week of childbirth due to health complications.)  On Wednesday, February 8, Madonna took to social media to share the happy news. “I can officially confirm I have completed the process of adopting twin sisters from Malawi and am overjoyed that they are now part of our family,” she captioned an image of herself walking between the two little girls. “I am deeply grateful to all those in Malawi who helped make this possible, and I ask the media please to respect our privacy during this transitional time. 🙏🏻 Thank you also to my friends, family and my very large team for all your support and Love!”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!

Madonna was hit with a series of “uncomfortable questions” by a judge before she was granted permission to adopt her 4-year-old twin girls from Malawi, the presiding judge said in court documents obtained by The Associated Press on Wednesday, February 8.","Title: Madonna Subjected to Rigorous Questioning Before Adoption Approval, Court Documents Reveal

In a recent development surrounding the controversial adoption process involving pop icon Madonna, court documents obtained by The Associated Press on Wednesday, February 8, have shed new light on the rigorous questioning the renowned singer faced before being granted permission to adopt her 4-year-old twin girls from Malawi.

Amid allegations of potential preferential treatment and concerns over the ethical implications of international adoption, the presiding judge handling Madonna's case revealed that he diligently interrogated the global star during the proceedings. The judicial scrutiny is set to provide significant reassurance to those questioning the integrity of this high-profile adoption.

Judge's questioning described as ""uncomfortable""

According to the court documents, the presiding judge subjected Madonna to a series of demanding and probing questions. The judge's intent was to ensure that the acclaimed artist had not only fulfilled all legal requirements but also demonstrated a genuine commitment to providing a loving and secure home for the two orphaned girls from Malawi.

The judge, who chose to remain anonymous, stated that Madonna did not receive any preferential treatment and that the process adhered strictly to legal protocols. The court documents clarified that the line of questioning aimed to assess Madonna's suitability as a parent and her understanding of the cultural, social, and emotional factors associated with integrating the adopted children into a new family environment.

The judge further emphasized the relevance of impartial assessment in international adoptions, stating the need to guarantee that the process upholds the best interests of the children involved and ardently adheres to local and international regulations.

Madonna's sincere commitment to her new role as a mother

Throughout the court proceedings, Madonna expressed unwavering dedication to embracing her role as a responsible parent. She exhibited a comprehensive understanding of her duties, obligations, and the unique challenges that come with raising children from a different cultural background.

It is important to note that Madonna's tireless philanthropy and charitable endeavors in Malawi have been widely recognized internationally. Her ongoing commitment to the African country, in the form of educational and humanitarian programs, has endeared her to many. The court also acknowledged this involvement as evidence of her sincere intentions in seeking to provide a loving home for the orphaned twins.

A transparent and just legal process

The transparency of the entire adoption process emphasized the judiciary's commitment to ensuring that all prospective parents undergo comprehensive scrutiny before being approved. These measures seek to safeguard against potential exploitation, illegal adoptions, or situations where the children's wellbeing may be compromised.

By subjecting Madonna to a rigorous and uncomfortably probing examination of her suitability as a parent, the court aimed to safeguard the interests of the twin girls. It was determined that Madonna had met all necessary legal requirements and demonstrated her unwavering resolve to provide a nurturing environment for her children.

The adoption approval serves as a testament to Madonna's unwavering dedication to motherhood. The global icon has consistently maintained her commitment to this arduous process, ensuring that her adoption adheres to international regulations while prioritizing the wellbeing of the children involved.

As the legal proceedings drew to a close, Madonna expressed her immense gratitude to the judiciary and the people of Malawi for the opportunity to expand her family and provide a loving home to the twin girls. The global superstar remains committed to her philanthropic efforts in the region, aiming to secure a brighter future for the children of Malaw"

According to In Touch, the two requested more time to work out agreements for the custody of their six children and the distribution of their assets earlier this month. ""They had been diligently going along privately and amicably, trying to keep the focus on the family,"" says a source. ""But suddenly, Angelina reversed course when she felt Brad was pushing too hard to resolve the situation to his benefit."" A court order excepted by the tab states, ""The completion date for all proceedings before the temporary judge is extended from Dec. 31, 2017, to Dec. 31, 2018."" Says the insider: ""This means their custody battle can drag on for another year."" Brad and Angelina split in September 2016. Their current custody deal gives Angelina primary custody while Brad gets visitation. He's reportedly asking for joint custody. Meanwhile, an OK report claiming the two are calling off the divorce altogether has been debunked by Gossip Cop.  RELATED: Celebrity splits of 2017",1,en,Judge extends Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's custody and divorce proceedings Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie could be looking at another whole year of drawn-out split negotiations.,"In a surprising turn of events, Judge [Name] has decided to extend Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's highly publicized custody and divorce proceedings, potentially prolonging their estrangement by an entire year. The celebrity couple, whose tumultuous split has captivated tabloids and fans alike, now face further uncertainty and potential complications on their path to resolution.

Since their shocking separation in 2016, the A-list actors have been embroiled in a bitter legal battle, leaving their six children caught in the crossfire. The ongoing custody and divorce proceedings have been mired in countless disputes, resulting in multiple temporary agreements that only served to maintain a fragile status quo.

Judge [Name]'s decision to extend the proceedings not only reflects the complexity of the case but also reveals the immense challenges the court faces in reaching a fair and lasting arrangement for the former Hollywood power couple.

Legal experts assert that this development suggests unresolved issues still plague the once dazzling Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie romance. Although certain aspects have already been decided, such as the court's recognition of the couple as legally divorced, disputed matters related to child custody, financial settlements, and property distribution continue to present formidable hurdles.

It is undeniable that the elongated negotiations have taken their toll on both parties, already grappling with the emotional strain of dissolving a once-envied union. The subsequent toll on Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's reputation, not to mention their public image, has been significant.

As the proceedings extend further into the future, concerns are mounting about the welfare of their children and the emotional impact these protracted negotiations might have on them. The delay only perpetuates the instability in their lives, depriving them of the stability and sense of normalcy children deserve.

While Judge [Name] has not provided an official explanation for the extension, legal analysts suggest that the complexity of the case necessitates additional time for a thorough examination of all relevant aspects. Furthermore, certain sources indicate that the sheer volume of evidence and testimonies has overwhelmed the court, necessitating the extension to ensure a comprehensive and fair resolution.

The countless delays, continuing alongside close scrutiny from media and public, have only amplified the couple's anxieties and frustrations. However, it remains crucial for Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie to focus on their children's well-being, finding strength within this daunting experience to prioritize their family's future.

Only time will reveal the ultimate outcome of this prolonged legal battle, and fans around the globe anxiously await any glimpse into the once-charmed couple's path forward. With the extended custody and divorce proceedings now set to continue for the foreseeable future, all involved parties must exercise patience while we anticipate a resolution to this deeply entrenched Hollywood separation."

gossipcop-880467,"Share Tweet Email Copy Link Copied  Jamie Lee Curtis says in a new interview that she'd happily reprise her iconic role as Laurie Strode in a sequel to 2018's Halloween revival, if director David Gordon Green returns. There's no question that the newest Halloween, which wipes the slate clean with all other sequels in the long-running franchise, is a rousing success. Strong critical reviews gave way to a massive debut at the box office, one of the highest ever in October.  Green's Halloween certainly benefited from a return to the same basic premise as John Carpenter's classic original, trading in decades of increasingly messy follow-ups for a direct line to the Michael Myers that terrified audiences in the first place. The director went back to basics for this one as he avoided the supernatural and went for a renewed focus on the psychological. Clearly, Curtis was happy with the job that Green did, as are theatergoers. And despite the film's commercial success, that's likely not on the legendary actress' radar as far as whether she'd do another Halloween. But the director is.  Related: Halloween's 5 Timelines Explained (And Which Movies You MUST See)  As she explained simply in a new interview with Empire Magazine Australia (via Bloody Disgusting), Curtis says she'd be in for another Halloween sequel if Green takes the helm once again. It's certainly possible, since the original plan from Blumhouse was to shoot two Halloween sequels back-to-back. Producers ultimately decided that making two films at once was too risky. But now, it sure looks like another film will follow, with or without Green behind the cameras. ""If David Gordon Green called me up and said let’s do another Halloween, I would do another Halloween,"" Curtis said.  Producer Malek Akkad expounded upon Blumhouse's decision to keep it to one sequel in a recent interview. Essentially, he found it too ambitious to shoot two Halloween films without knowing how the first one would be received. Well, the next Halloween is reportedly already in motion, but the latest report suggests that Green and co-writer Danny McBride wouldn't be on board for it. That could change, but if Jason Blum is determined to pull a Paranormal Activity and crank out the next sequel in time for Halloween 2019, he'll need a decision from the director pretty quickly.  It's also possible that money talks. Halloween is already becoming one of Blumhouse's highest-grossing films after just one weekend, and it's doing so on a typically tight Blumhouse budget. At over $90 million domestically already, the film has a good chance to ultimately blow by Paranormal Activity ($107.9 million) and Paranormal Activity 3 ($104 million) and settle in at No. 3 behind the studio's crown jewels, Get Out and Split. Green may not necessarily need the money, but it might be hard for the director to turn away from that kind of financial success, especially when he was originally planning to do at least two films anyway.  Still, based on Curtis' comment in her interview, she may not be interested in another appearance as Laurie Strode unless Green is back. It's hard to blame her; Green had established himself as a formidable cinematic storyteller with Stronger, and showed off his horror chops to thrilling effect with Halloween. He and Curtis certainly make a fine duo, but 2018's Halloween may ultimately be the only time they team up.

gossipcop-877012,"Flavor Flav needs money. So says a lawsuit filed in federal court Wednesday, in which Flav accuses Public Enemy co-founder Chuck D and two business managers of cheating him out of royalties and merchandising revenue.  Flav — real name, William Drayton — contends that his Public Enemy royalties have dwindled to almost nothing in recent years. In the last few months, he and his representatives have attempted to get a full accounting of the money owed to him, but have been thwarted.  Flavor Flav and Chuck D were the two core members of the group. Chuck D was seen as the serious musical talent while Flav played the goofy hype man. The suit hints at years of pent-up hard feelings over this perception of their relative importance. Flav contends that there have been many attempts “to minimize his role in the Public Enemy business” over the years, while managers continued to exploit “his fame and persona to market the brand.”  In addition to naming Chuck D as a defendant, the suit also goes after Gary Rinaldo, the group’s business manager since 2008, and Clifton “Greg” Johnson, who was until recently Flav’s longtime personal manager.  Related Chuck D Joins Universal Hip Hop Museum as Chairman of the Celebrity Board LeBron James and Channing Tatum Pitch 'Public Enemy' Lands at New Line  Flav alleges that he has not seen a dime in streaming or download revenue, and that the defendants have licensed Public Enemy’s image without his permission.  The suit states that Rinaldo “entered into merchandising deals for products as disparate as Public Enemy branded watches, dolls of Drayton and bicycles, all without consent of Drayton, all without advance notice or compensation to Drayton.” Flav also alleges that he was not consulted about a set of Public Enemy action figures, which were sculpted in Japan, and has received no payment from the sale of the toys.  This summer, Public Enemy made a new album, “Nothing is Quick in the Desert,” available as a free download for a period of just six days. Though Flavor Flav was listed as an executive producer on the album, he says he was completely blindsided by it.  The suit says that Flav was contacted this spring about the project, and agreed to come to California to record.  “Drayton was in need of money to support his family, and Defendants were aware of that fact,” the suit states.  Flav requested a $75,000 fee. After a day of recording, he was given just $7,500 and told that more money would be wired to him later. He says he went to his hotel to wait for the remaining amount, and when it did not arrive he went back home to Las Vegas. According to the suit, he did not believe that his recordings would be used because they were of poor quality, and was surprised when the album was released on June 29.  “He had never heard of the album, nor heard any of the final mixes,” the suit states.

When Ellen kisses up to her famous friends, Portia becomes consumed with self-doubt,” the source told National Enquirer newspaper.  According to the newspaper, Rossi’s friends suggested her to seek therapy but the “Nip/Tuck” actress was “resisting help.”  “Ellen has been in counselling, both solo and with Portia. Part of their therapy is to go on more date nights. That’s why they’ve been seen out and about more together lately.

In a recent revelation that has shocked fans across the globe, it has been reported by aceshowbiz.com that Portia de Rossi, the esteemed wife of renowned TV host Ellen DeGeneres, has resorted to self-harm as a means to cope with the marital difficulties that the couple has been facing.

The news emerged through aceshowbiz.com's exhaustive investigative efforts, shedding light on the hidden struggles that have plagued the typically private relationship of DeGeneres and de Rossi. With the reputable online publication providing a platform for these revelations, it becomes essential for society to acknowledge the severity of the situation and address it with utmost care and sensitivity.

Now, more than ever, discussions surrounding mental health should be held with empathy and understanding. While it is disheartening to comprehend that someone as beloved and influential as Portia de Rossi has allegedly faced such distress, we must now focus on lending support and providing the necessary resources for her recovery.

Marital problems can burden any relationship, regardless of public recognition or success. The facade of happiness often presented by well-known celebrities can easily deceive us, as they too experience the challenges and hardships that are part of the human condition. It is crucial that we remember this and respond with compassion.

Experts in the field of mental health suggest that self-harm can stem from various underlying psychological conditions. This alarmingly destructive coping mechanism often provides a temporary and illusory refuge from emotional turmoil. Understanding the complexities of such behaviors is vital in order to address the root causes and support individuals who find themselves in these distressing situations.

As the news of Portia de Rossi's alleged self-harm unfolds, it prompts us to reflect on the importance of open communication, empathy, and the provision of mental health resources for all individuals, regardless of their standing in society.

Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi have been widely admired not only for their professional achievements but also for using their public platform to raise awareness on various social issues. Now, it is time for society to rally around them, extending the same compassion they have shown to others in need.

We hope that this distressing chapter in their lives can serve as a catalyst for serious discussions surrounding mental health, ultimately leading to stronger support systems and treatment options for those grappling with similar challenges worldwide.

As investigations continue, it becomes crucial for the public and media alike to approach this issue responsibly, while keeping the focus on understanding, empathy, and support. Mental health is a significant concern that deserves attention and resources, and our collective response to these distressing revelations should reflect this urgency."

gossipcop-902055,"Christmas is a time for goodwill, seasonal cheer, and forgiveness, so it seems fitting that the royal family is set to move past some recent rumors to once again celebrate Christmas en masse at the royal estate of Sandringham.  Despite talk of sibling rivalry, tearful duchesses, and diva-like behavior in the court of Kensington Palace, William and Kate Middleton and Harry and Meghan Markle will be together on Christmas Day, the Palace has confirmed. The news comes just after Kensington Palace attempted to snuff out reports of difficulty between the duchesses with a terse comment to The Sun over the weekend.  Although it is William and Kate’s turn to visit the Middletons this year (they usually alternate Christmas between their two families and spent Christmas with the Queen last year), royal sources say that they have decided to join the royal family for Christmas Day.  It is believed they will then head to Bucklebury, Kate’s parents’ hometown, to enjoy a second Christmas with her family.  Kate’s mother, Carole Middleton, revealed in her first-ever interview, published in The Daily Telegraph over the weekend, that she has prepared an extra-special Christmas this year to welcome the two newest family members, her grandsons Prince Louis and Arthur, son of Pippa Middleton.  There will be no fewer than 12 Christmas trees at Bucklebury Manor, the Middleton family’s home, with one just for Prince George to decorate, but the Cambridges will have to skip the Middletons’ traditional smoked salmon and Champagne brunch on Christmas morning because they will be with the Queen and the rest of the royal family at church in Norfolk. It will be the first time the Cambridges and the Sussexes, a.k.a the “Fab Four,” will have been pictured together since reports of a simmering feud rocked the Palace.  It was reported this weekend that courtiers have launched a “mole hunt” to try to uncover who has been leaking stories of tensions between Harry and William and Kate and Meghan. Reports of discord between the couples emerged after Kensington Palace announced last weekend that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex would be moving out of Kensington Palace in the new year and into Frogmore House in Windsor.  Since then it has been claimed that Kate and Meghan don’t get along and that the brothers have fallen out because William voiced concerns about how quickly Harry’s relationship with Meghan was moving.  The Queen, who dislikes any rumors of discord regarding her family, will no doubt be relieved that the family will be coming together on Christmas Day. After the family celebrates with a turkey dinner on Christmas Eve, the sight of the foursome at church on Christmas morning will, courtiers hope, put an end to the unhappy narrative that the couples have fallen out.

There will be no fewer than 12 Christmas trees at Bucklebury Manor, the Middleton family’s home, with one just for Prince George to decorate, but the Cambridges will have to skip the Middletons’ traditional smoked salmon and Champagne brunch on Christmas morning because they will be with the Queen and the rest of the royal family at church in Norfolk. It will be the first time the Cambridges and the Sussexes, a.k.a the “Fab Four,” will have been pictured together since reports of a simmering feud rocked the Palace.  It was reported this weekend that courtiers have launched a “mole hunt” to try to uncover who has been leaking stories of tensions between Harry and William and Kate and Meghan. Reports of discord between the couples emerged after Kensington Palace announced last weekend that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex would be moving out of Kensington Palace in the new year and into Frogmore House in Windsor.  Since then it has been claimed that Kate and Meghan don’t get along and that the brothers have fallen out because William voiced concerns about how quickly Harry’s relationship with Meghan was moving.  The Queen, who dislikes any rumors of discord regarding her family, will no doubt be relieved that the family will be coming together on Christmas Day. After the family celebrates with a turkey dinner on Christmas Eve, the sight of the foursome at church on Christmas morning will, courtiers hope, put an end to the unhappy narrative that the couples have fallen out.

In an exclusive interview with The Times, a renowned actor recently shed light on the taxing side of the entertainment industry, candidly revealing the personal struggles he faced while working on a particular project. The actor, whose identity we have chosen to protect, disclosed that he spent an extended period of time feeling mentally and physically drained, hindered by the excessive consumption of alcohol during the shoot.

During the compelling conversation, the actor bravely discussed the toll that his excessive drinking took on his mental clarity, expressing concerns that the studio may have consequently reduced his filming days due to his difficulty articulating coherent thoughts. The actor's words revealed a stark reality behind the glitz and glamour, underscoring the immense pressure artists often endure to deliver exceptional performances.

""I just got wasted the whole time,"" he confided, his voice tinged with a mix of regret and vulnerability. ""You feel insane, but I think the studio cut my days because I started speaking total gibberish.""

This unexpected revelation has left fans and industry professionals contemplating the underlying challenges that actors confront behind the scenes. The actor's courage in publicly unveiling this deeply personal struggle sheds light on a seldom-discussed aspect of the film industry's demanding nature.

While the actor did not explicitly specify the project or the date of its shooting, his disclosure forces us to reevaluate our perception of the final product that graces the silver screen. The rigorous demands of an actor's commitment to their craft, combined with the inherent pressures of the industry, sometimes lead to unforeseen hardships that viewers may not fully appreciate.

Instances of substance abuse or excessive indulgence in order to cope with the mounting pressures of a high-stakes project are not exclusive to this particular actor. Hollywood, much like any other high-octane industry, has long been plagued by such stories. Yet, by choosing to boldly voice his struggles, this actor has taken an admirable step towards eradicating the stigma surrounding mental health and personal well-being within the entertainment sphere.

It is important to acknowledge that the actor's sincerity in sharing his personal journey does not excuse any potential misconduct or unprofessional behavior. However, the revelation serves as a somber reminder that behind the glimmering facade of the red carpet and the dazzling premieres lies a more complex reality—one wherein actors are human beings, susceptible to the same challenges and vulnerabilities as anyone else.

As the film community begins grappling with the implications of this actor's revelations, it is our collective responsibility to address the systemic issues that may contribute to an environment where exhaustion and unhealthy coping mechanisms thrive. Honest conversations, advocacy for comprehensive mental health support, and a renewed commitment to fostering a safe and sustainable work culture are central to ensuring the well-being of all involved in this captivating industry.

The actor's brave revelation not only grants us a brief glimpse into his personal struggles but also raises broader questions about the vast range of issues faced by actors within the film industry. As the conversation continues, it is our hope that this disclosure will prompt introspection and change, ultimately fostering a more compassionate and nurturing environment for everyone involved in the creation of movie magic."
gossipcop-3316804883,"Millions of people watched her get engaged to Chris Soules on national television last year, but when former Bachelor star Whitney Bischoff and her fiancé Ricky Angel were engaged on July 15, this proposal was decidedly more intimate.  “It was just perfect,” Bischoff tells PEOPLE. “I was completely shocked. Ricky got me good! I was so happy that I couldn’t quit smiling. My cheeks hurt!”  The 31-year-old fertility nurse met sales manager Angel on the dating app Bumble (“Ladies pick — finally it was my choice,” jokes Bischoff) last September; the couple moved in together in May.  “On our first date, we just clicked,” she says. “It was easy and that’s the way it should be.”  Still, Bischoff admits it was “nerve-wracking” to jump back into the dating scene after her painful split from Soules in 2015, nearly seven months after they were engaged. “I was still a little bit broken and trying to pick up the pieces. But from day one there was open communication with Ricky about what I had gone through. I think one of the reasons I fell in love so quickly is that I could say everything and know I was not being judged.”  Bischoff hasn’t spoken to Soules recently but says she wishes him well. “I hope that he meets someone, if he hasn’t already, just as great for him and Ricky is for me.”  Now, Bischoff still watches The Bachelor, but says she’s moved on from her own reality show past. “That journey was a big part of my life,” she says. “But since I’ve met Ricky, I really haven’t looked back.”  Busy with wedding plans (the couple are looking at a date next fall), Bischoff says she nonetheless has positive associations with the show. “It’s sad that it ended the way it had to end, but I was still looking for that perfect someone. I didn’t let my past close off my heart. Everything works out for a reason.”",1,en,"Millions of people watched her get engaged to Chris Soules on national television last year, but when former Bachelor star Whitney Bischoff and her fiancé Ricky Angel were engaged on July 15, this proposal was decidedly more intimate.","Millions of viewers were captivated as they witnessed the enchanting moment when Whitney Bischoff said ""yes"" to Chris Soules on national television last year.

gossipcop-6523629288,"Ever since Jennifer Aniston married Justin Theroux, pregnancy rumors have followed the couple. Something as simple as a picture of Aniston with her hand on her stomach is proof enough for some tabloids that the actress is expecting a baby. Now, a new report claims that the Friends star has hired a surrogate, could there be any truth to the story?  In the new issue of Star, the tabloid features the headline, “Jen To Justin: I’ll Raise Our Baby Alone!” followed by a story that asserts Aniston wants to become a mom, and she will do it with or without her husband. The publication claims to have a source that reveals Aniston’s marriage is “on the rocks,” and she is planning to be a single mom.  ?…❤️✌️ A post shared by @justintheroux on Aug 5, 2017 at 4:23pm PDT  “Privately, she has told friends that she’s secretly gone ahead and hired a surrogate mother to carry her child to birth. And she’s vowed to raise the baby alone,” tells the insider.  But then the source says the actress is hoping to choose the right woman soon, completely contradicting the earlier quote, which is a huge red flag that something isn’t right with this claim.  But many think the tabloid story is completely false and contradictory quotes prove the story is garbage, questioning why the insider is sharing such private and secret information with a tabloid.  This is the same magazine that published a story earlier this year claiming Aniston herself was pregnant, but then didn’t mention that at all in its latest baby claims.  Aniston told Glamour magazine back in August that not only are the pregnancy tabloid stories guilty of body shaming, but they are also an invasion into a private matter between her and her husband. She said it is no one’s business whether or not she has a baby.  Jennifer Aniston went on to say that the subject of having a baby is a sensitive topic for her, and no one has the right to judge other people’s choices.

Something as simple as a picture of Aniston with her hand on her stomach is proof enough for some tabloids that the actress is expecting a baby.

In recent years, celebrity gossip magazines and tabloids have clung tightly to persistent rumors surrounding the flourishing personal life of Hollywood actress Jennifer Aniston. The former ""Friends"" star has long been subjected to unwarranted speculation about her marital status, and now it seems, the scurrilous rumor mill has shifted its attention towards her reproductive plans.

As Aniston and her husband, acclaimed actor and screenwriter Justin Theroux, continue to relish their wedded bliss, headlines continue to emerge, perpetuating the notion that a pregnancy might be imminent. Sensationalist publications eagerly seize upon any minute details or photographs deemed remotely suggestive, feeding an insatiable public appetite for the private affairs of the rich and famous.

The latest flurry of speculation erupted when a snap of the beloved actress, gently cradling her stomach during a casual stroll, surfaced online. Almost instantaneously, tabloids began feverishly concocting narratives of a blossoming pregnancy, interpreting this seemingly innocent moment as tangible evidence of an impending addition to the couple's family.

While Aniston and Theroux have admirably maintained a dignified silence amidst the deluge of intrusive scrutiny, it is imperative that we, as responsible journalists, approach these rumors with a level-headed perspective. Unsubstantiated assumptions based on mere speculation have a dangerous tendency to amplify trivial matters into a salacious frenzy, one that invariably detracts from the achievements and talents of individuals in the spotlight.

It is worth noting that since her marriage to Theroux in a private and intimate ceremony, Jennifer Aniston has consistently remained focused on her thriving acting career. A talented and versatile artist, she has graced both the big screen and television with her captivating presence, reaffirming her relevance as a prominent figure in the entertainment industry. Aniston's commitment to honing her craft has been unwavering, as evidenced by her recent critically acclaimed performances.

Yet, it appears that Aniston's incredible talent is often overshadowed by the hounding speculation surrounding her personal life. The public, driven by a voyeuristic curiosity, inadvertently fuels the unrelenting cycle of rumors and baseless conjecture. The constant scrutiny and invasive probing into the private realm of celebrities prompt questions regarding the collective values and priorities of modern society.

In this era of information overload, it is vital that we exercise restraint and discernment when confronted with unfounded gossip masquerading as news. As journalists, our integrity demands that we resist the temptation to fuel the flames of speculation, catering to an audience that thrives on prying into the lives of public figures.

In conclusion, the recent pregnancy rumors swirling around Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux remain an unverified conjecture, pure matters of speculation that are often fueled by the sensationalist media. It is crucial that we redirect our attention towards their notable accomplishments rather than perpetuating unsubstantiated claims, offering veneration to their privacy, personal lives, and their contributions to the world of entertainment."

gossipcop-5840642713,"Sky high prices are reportedly keeping fans from buying tickets to Taylor Swift’s upcoming Reputation tour, per a story by the New York Post. Though her 1989 world tour boasted numerous sold out performances (it eventually became the highest grossing tour of 2015), it appears her considerably more expensive snake persona is a tougher sell.  Last month, her “longtime” tour promoter told Billboard, “By the time all the tickets are sold next week, I’ll be celebrating Taylor’s birthday with a cocktail in my hand and sold-out concerts all over the world.” But her birthday has come and gone, and not one date has sold out.  Reputation was the biggest-selling album of 2017 and the tour is shaping up to be far from ill-attended, so the Post’s headline, “Taylor Swift’s Reputation tour shaping up to be a disaster,” is a little much. It does, however, highlight the problems with unpredictable pricing, scalpers, and Ticketmaster in general.  The company’s “Verified Fan” program, which they would like you to believe is all about rewarding music lovers, appears to be nothing but a cash grab that takes advantage of Swift-obsessed teens with easy access to their parents’ credit card numbers. People willing to drop $50 on merch, the Post reports, could “improve [their] position in line to purchase tickets.” And, once accessible, the tickets are often too expensive for many fans.  “I paid $150 for my ticket with amazing seats for the 1989 tour,” one fan wrote. “Now for the same seats I have to pay about $500.”  Advertisement  In related news, tickets to Katy Perry’s Friday show in New Orleans are currently starting at $23.",1,en,"Sky high prices are reportedly keeping fans from buying tickets to Taylor Swift’s upcoming Reputation tour, per a story by the New York Post.","Sky high prices are reportedly keeping fans from buying tickets to Taylor Swift's upcoming Reputation tour, per a story by the New York Post.

In the world of music and entertainment, Taylor Swift has undoubtedly carved her name in the industry's history, captivating audiences with her mesmerizing performances and lyrical masterpieces. With millions of admirers eagerly awaiting her upcoming Reputation tour, a concerning trend has emerged, casting a shadow of uncertainty over the concert series that had once held immense promise.

According to an investigative report by the reputable New York Post, a formidable barrier stands between die-hard Taylor Swift fans and their dream of attending her highly anticipated Reputation tour – the sky-high ticket prices. Gripped by the crushing realization of exorbitant costs, enthusiastic supporters are finding it increasingly challenging to secure their place in the crowd that will witness Swift's live performance extravaganza.

In a shocking turn of events, what should have been a joyous occasion for fans across the nation has become overshadowed by the monetary constraints imposed by astronomical ticket prices. This unwelcome news has prompted fervent discussion and debate in the online community, where a chorus of disappointed followers has arisen, sharing their dismay and frustration.

As the New York Post highlights in their comprehensive story, Swift's star power in the music industry has propelled her to unprecedented acclaim. Swift's concerts are a sensory delight, filled with magical moments crafted through exceptional stage design, captivating choreography, and her radiant stage presence. However, the soaring prices of admission threaten to alienate her loyal fan base, creating an unintentional hierarchy based on financial means rather than genuine devotion.

Analysts and industry experts have expressed concerns surrounding the impact of these prohibitive ticket prices. The fear is that loyal fans, who have ardently supported Swift throughout her illustrious career, will be deprived of the opportunity to witness her artistry firsthand. This raises pertinent questions about the ethical boundaries of concert ticket pricing and the responsibilities held by artists to ensure their music remains accessible to all.

While some argue that premium prices reflect the sheer magnitude of Swift's reputation and are a testament to her remarkable achievements, others maintain that concerts should be a democratic experience, welcoming fans of all backgrounds and financial circumstances. Swift herself has consistently communicated her gratitude to her fans, acknowledging their significance in her journey to stardom. Now, amid these concerns, the question arises: will Swift take steps to address her fans' grievances?

As fans eagerly await Swift's response, the burden lies with concert organizers and promoters to enact measures that strike a fair balance between profitability and fan inclusion. The Reputation tour, a highly anticipated series of events worthy of praise and admiration, should not become a privilege reserved for only the elite. Instead, it should embrace the essence of music, bringing people together in celebration of an artist whose melodies have resonated with millions.

The ball now lies in the court of the music industry as a whole. The fate of Taylor Swift's Reputation tour may serve as a catalyst for change, forcing a reevaluation of inflated ticket prices. It is a critical juncture where the industry must prioritize inclusivity, ensuring that the magic of live performances remains accessible to fans of all walks of life. Only through collective action can we preserve the spirit of music that has the power to unite and inspire us all."

gossipcop-888650,"AMC's zombie drama returned last Sunday with the season 9 premiere---an episode which marked an uptick in overall quality for The Walking Dead, but still made some old, avoidable foibles that almost look like bad habits at this point. New showrunner Angela Kang has been a writer on the show since Season 2, and it appears that even with improved dialogue and cinematography, she's been unable to shed some of the show's most annoying proclivities. Old habits die hard, it seems. But, like Gregory and a few other characters, they really do need to die. Let's take a look at three big mistakes the show made in its Season 9 premiere, and how each could have been easily avoided with a little more quality control and a little bit more courage. With some very small changes, this could have been a much better episode. Spoilers through Season 9 of 'The Walking Dead' follow. 1. The museum scene. Things got off to something of a bad start when our heroes went to D.C. I'm going to list this as a two-part problem. My first problem with this sequence is a creative disagreement with the show's producers and writers. My second is pretty much just the objective truth. First: An excursion to Washington D.C. to find seeds and other tools should have been a much more interesting, extended story. I think you could easily fit in an episode or two with a small group of scavengers going to D.C. and getting into various pickles there. That it was just one not very good scene at a museum really diminished something I was looking forward to, stripping of it of almost all its potential as an interesting little adventure (which the show has so few of these days.) Second: The museum scene was just bad. There was very little explanation as to why they needed all these heavy objects---surely there were more modern versions of things like carts and ploughs which they could find on farms or in hardware stores. Worse, the entire sequence with the glass floor was embarrassingly bad. The floor itself would not have cracked so easily. That kind of glass is made to withstand a great deal more impact. But even if they'd had it broken to begin with, making it more precarious from the get-go, there was no reason they couldn't have found another way around it. Passing items over the railing would have worked. Ezekiel could have avoided walking the entire length of the breaking glass by simply turning to one side or the other once exiting the stairs. This is a classic example of The Walking Dead's writers treating its viewers with contempt. We aren't that stupid. And neither are these characters. These hardened survivors of the apocalypse should know better---and would know better if they weren't continually written into these same corners over and over and over again. This entire sequence was insulting to our intelligence and had no business being in a premiere cable TV show. 2. The death scene. The second big problem of the night came shortly after the first. Our group, comprised largely of characters we know and then also one other guy named Ken, is bringing the museum loot back to Alexandria and Hilltop when a small mob of zombies shuffles up behind them. This leads to much fear and commotion, despite this being a much smaller zombie mob than we've seen the same survivors deal with easily in the past. One thing leads to another and they decide to all run away and, bafflingly, abandon the horses. In an apocalypse where cars are no longer an option, horses must be one of the most prized---and hard to come by---resources out there. But a few zombies can scare Rick and his band of hardened survivors away regardless. Utterly unconvincing. So when Ken (I think that was his name) runs back to save the horses we know right away he's going to die. For reasons the show cannot provide, a zombie manages to sneak up on him and nobody can get to him in time to save him. Maybe that looked okay on paper, but it didn't work on TV and left us with that bad, unconvincing taste in our mout",0,en,0,"AMC's zombie drama returned last Sunday with the season 9 premiere---an episode which marked an uptick in overall quality for The Walking Dead, but still made some old, avoidable foibles that almost look like bad habits at this point.

The Fix: Now, you can fix #1 and #2 in one fell swoop pretty easily (but it won't fix #3.) Simply have the glass in the museum already breaking when they get there. Have them do everything in their power to avoid standing on it (like actual people with a self-preservation motive would do) but have something go wrong. Maybe there's one last item (like the cart) that they can't get around the glass and they lose control and instead of Ezekiel falling through the glass, Ken falls through the glass and is torn apart by zombies in the most gruesome manner possible. Now we can avoid the bad parts of the museum scene and cut the other scene entirely and we get a more shocking, gory death. Everybody wins! There's just one problem . . . . 3. Using a character we don't know as a catalyst for an important event. Don't do that. Every single significant death in a show needs to have a reason or serve some higher purpose, even if it just to shock audiences. Ken's death in the Season 9 premiere served a purpose, but it didn't connect with us emotionally. It was a catalyst for Gregory's final, fatal betrayal of Maggie. It led him to make a very stupid power play, the straw that broke the Maggie's back, as it were, when he got the blacksmith drunk and convinced him to kill Maggie. The problem? There's no payoff. No emotional weight. Because Ken was not an established character at all. He was introduced just to die. His parents were introduced just so that the father could become Gregory's tool in his latest horrible scheme. This is something we saw happen from time to time"

gossipcop-6225895099,"Chris Soules, former star of ABC’s “The Bachelor,” after his arrest. (Buchanan County Sheriff via AP) Iowa farmer Chris Soules, a former star on ABC’s “The Bachelor” who charmed reality TV viewers with his small-town life, was arrested this week after police said he fled a crash that killed a fellow farmer. Soules, 35, was charged with leaving the scene of a fatal crash, a class D felony, and could face up to five years in prison if he is convicted. The case has garnered the attention of Soules’s “Bachelor” fans as well as residents of Arlington, Iowa, where he lives, who had come to appreciate the reality TV star’s work as an unofficial Iowa ambassador and farm industry advocate. “This story is going to spread like wildfire around here and probably all over because of who he is,” Mary Jo Brown, Arlington’s city clerk, told the Des Moines Register. “Sometimes fame isn’t your friend.” Soules, who also appeared in “Dancing with the Stars” and “Worst Chefs in America,” called 911 at 8:20 p.m. Monday evening to report that he had rear-ended a tractor on a rural road north of the tiny town of Aurora, about six miles away from his home. The tractor veered into a ditch after being struck by his 2008 Chevrolet Silverado, Soules said. The tractor driver — later identified as 66-year-old Kenneth Mosher, a Vietnam War veteran — was unconscious and not breathing, Soules told the 911 operator, according to audio obtained by local media. The man had a pulse, but there was blood around his mouth, Soules said. Soules identified himself on the call, which lasted nearly six minutes, and sounded frantic. Between heavy breathing, he answered the dispatcher’s questions and took instructions. Soules told the 911 operator he did not know how to perform CPR and could be heard asking unidentified people at the scene if they could perform the lifesaving measure. The call ended abruptly after the operator told Soules law enforcement and medical first responders were on the way. “Can I, can I call you back really quick?” Soules asked the dispatcher. “Yeah, you can call me back,” she says. “Thank you,” Soules responds. Soules left the crash site after emergency responders arrived, but before deputies with the Buchanan County Sheriff’s Office were on the scene, according to authorities. Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Scott Bright told the Des Moines Register that Soules fled the scene on foot and later got into a truck. In police audio obtained by local media, a deputy told a dispatcher that Soules “took off” in a red truck. Authorities are trying to identify who picked up Soules in the truck, Buchanan County Sheriff Bill Wolfgram told the Associated Press. That person could face charges, he said. Alcohol was found at the scene and investigators are trying to determine whose it was and whether it or speed were factors in the crash. Soules was arrested about five hours after the incident and booked into the Buchanan County Jail, the Associated Press reported. He posted a $10,000 bond Tuesday morning and was released on the condition that he surrender his passport and wear an electronic monitor. During his first appearance in court, the Buchanan County assistant attorney told the judge that Soules refused to cooperate with law enforcement after they located him at his home. He “would not come out,” the attorney said, until officials obtained a search warrant, which “took hours.” Chris Soules making his initial court appearance in Buchanan County @KWWL pic.twitter.com/72bvEg0wVR — Elizabeth Amanieh (@EAmaniehKWWL) April 25, 2017 Wolfgram told the Associated Press that investigators were “running into some roadblocks when it comes to getting information” but acknowledged Soules was acting within his constitutional rights.

ET’s Katie Krause spoke with Brolin at the Hallmark Channel and Hallmark Movies & Mysteries winter Television Critics Association red carpet on Saturday, where he revealed that despite his decades-long romance, he still doesn't have all the answers.  “I don’t know, because nobody trains you,” he said of the secret to his and Streisand's marriage. “This is my third time -- third marriage. I picked difficult situations the first two times, but I think you learn with each one. I’m a person that believes that if I’m wrong, that’s when I learn, and when I’m right, I haven’t learned a thing.”  Noting that he takes his relationship “day to day,” Brolin revealed that he’s an advocate of marriage counseling.  “I do believe in counseling if anybody ever has a problem in their marriage. Bring in a referee, talk it over, and I swear to you, it will dispel by the end of the session, each time!” he said. “Sometimes in a tough marriage, it’s tough to talk, but if you do, it works!”  The 77-year-old actor has also learned to maintain his marriage with Streisand by not interrupting her during hectic times.  “When she’s busy, she’s really focused, and part of our good relationship is that I understand that,” he shared. “And if I come to her with something important and she says, ‘I don’t have time right now,’ she doesn’t have time, period. That’s the way the mind works. You gotta focus.”  As for how Streisand, 75, makes him feel special, Brolin said, “I’m always welcome when I get home. I always get notes, ‘Hurry home!’ When I get there, there’s always something kind of great waiting for me, some plan, and I try to reciprocate.”  RELATED CONTENT:  Barbra Streisand Calls Out Golden Globes for Not Awarding More Female Directors  ‘Girls Trip' Star Tiffany Haddish Says She Taught Barbra Streisand All About Cardi B  Josh Brolin on His Ripped Bod and How He Knew Wife Kathyrn Boyd Was the One (Exclusive)  Related Gallery",1,en,"Two decades strong!

Heidi, 44, looks like a fountain of youth but it obviously takes more of an effort than we knew. But her loved one are over her ramming her perfection down their throats.  Adds the insider, “What also really annoys people is how Heidi fakes being normal. She even pretends to eat junk food when the cameras are on her but she hasn’t actually swallowed a bite of a burger in years.”  Just last month, she and her boyfriend spent time in Italy, so we really have no idea how she avoided the pasta and pizza!  “All she talks about is working out and what she’s eaten that day – which is usually not much more than a handful of nuts and steamed kale.” That doesn’t sound like fun.",1,en,"A source tells OK! exclusively, “Heidi has nothing to talk about except her workout routine, how she avoids carbs, the tricks her private chef or personal trainer are implementing…it’s so tedious for everyone in her life, including Vito Schnabel and a big reason why he needs a break so often.”","In a recent conversation with OK! Magazine, a confidential source has shed light on the growing concerns surrounding Heidi's monotonous daily discussions centered solely around her fitness regimen. According to the insider, her incessant focus on workout routines, carbohydrate avoidance techniques, and the meticulous details her personal chef and trainer employ has become a wearisome topic for those close to her – most notably, her partner Vito Schnabel, who apparently finds himself seeking respite with increasing frequency.

Unveiling the more mundane aspects of Heidi's life that have allegedly been afflicting her relationships, the source expressed the perceived tedium that accompanies her persistent discourse on exercise and dietary choices. Friends and acquaintances alike grow weary, as her conversations have become somewhat predictable, consistently orbiting around the minutiae of her fitness rituals.

While it is undoubtedly commendable that individuals aspire to maintain a healthy lifestyle and focus on personal well-being, the encumbering effect of this exclusive fixation on exercise and diet must also be acknowledged. The source emphasized that these seemingly repetitive conversations have undeniably created a strain on Heidi's relationship with Schnabel, prompting the much-needed breaks he periodically seeks.

It is essential to remember that maintaining healthy communication within relationships necessitates a diverse range of topics and interests. In the pursuit of harmony and longevity, a genuine effort must be made to cultivate shared experiences and engage in conversations that encompass a broader spectrum of life's intricacies.

OK! Magazine is eagerly awaiting an opportunity to share Heidi's side of the story, highlighting whether she recognizes the impact her exercise-centric conversations are having on her personal life. As we eagerly anticipate further development in this narrative, it is crucial to emphasize the significance of balanced dialogue within relationships, urging individuals to diversify their conversational repertoire and foster meaningful interactions beyond the realm of relentless fitness talk."

gossipcop-858931,"The Leftovers has closed the book on its final chapter. The HBO drama from Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta aired its finale Sunday night, and it did so by offering more closure than most viewers had been trained to anticipate — not only for all the major characters but even for the show's biggest mystery. (Note: spoilers abound below, so proceed with caution if you haven’t yet watched ""The Book of Nora."") Lindelof had long tempered expectations about the finale, telling The Hollywood Reporter last year when he was writing the final script that The Leftovers is in no way a mystery-solving show. ""If the takeaway from Lost was that there was a disgruntled portion of the fan base that said, 'You did not give satisfactory answers to the mysteries,' then I feel somewhat liberated with The Leftovers because that’s off the table,"" he said at the time. But in an emotional monologue that concludes the third and final season of the thought-provoking drama, Carrie Coon's character Nora Durst actually provides one possible answer to what happened to the 2 percent of the population that suddenly departed years ago. Whether or not she's telling the truth is up for debate. Seated across from an aged Kevin (Justin Theroux), Nora explains that years earlier she got into a machine that transported her to a parallel earth where the departed now live. It was the closure she'd always longed for — except that when she found her three children and husband, it was apparent that they were happy and had moved on with their lives. Realizing there was no place for her in their world, she had the creator of the machine send her back home. ""I knew that if I told you what happened that you would never believe me,"" Nora tells Kevin as she finishes her poignant tale. ""I believe you,"" Kevin assures her, tears streaming down his face.

Now that people have gotten a chance to watch the finale, what's the most surprising question you're getting about it?

When did you know that this is how you wanted to end t",0,en,0,"The Leftovers has closed the book on its final chapter. The HBO drama from Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta aired its finale Sunday night, and it did so by offering more closure than most viewers had been trained to anticipate — not only for all the major characters but even for the show's biggest mystery. (Note: spoilers abound below, so proceed with caution if you haven’t yet watched ""The Book of Nora."") Lindelof had long tempered expectations about the finale, telling The Hollywood Reporter last year when he was writing the final script that The Leftovers is in no way a mystery-solving show. ""If the takeaway from Lost was that there was a disgruntled portion of the fan base that said, 'You did not give satisfactory answers to the mysteries,' then I feel somewhat liberated with The Leftovers because that’s off the table,"" he said at the time. But in an emotional monologue that concludes the third and final season of the thought-provoking drama, Carrie Coon's character Nora Durst actually provides one possible answer to what happened to the 2 percent of the population that suddenly departed years ago. Whether or not she's telling the truth is up for debate. Seated across from an aged Kevin (Justin Theroux), Nora explains that years earlier she got into a machine that transported her to a parallel earth where the departed now live. It was the closure she'd always longed for — except that when she found her three children and husband, it was apparent that they were happy and had moved on with their lives. Realizing there was no place for her in their world, she had the creator of the machine send her back home. ""I knew that if I told you what happened that you would never believe me,"" Nora tells Kevin as she finishes her poignant tale. ""I believe you,"" Kevin assures her, tears streaming down his face. ""You do?"" she asks incredulously. ""Why wouldn't I believe you? You're here,"" he responds before reaching out to grab his former wife's hand. ""I'm here,"" Nora echoes, her mouth slowing turning upward into a smile. And with that, The Leftovers concluded its story, leaving the credibility of Nora's account open to interpretation.

They’re told in the first person, and it was sort of like, “Oh, yeah, how could we not end the series with Carrie Coon doing that?"" When did you know that this is how you wanted to end the show? Very early on. The holdover writers from season two got together in January, and all we talked about was, “What’s the last scene of the finale, and when and where does the finale take place? And what are the things we want to resolve definitively, and what are the things that we’re OK not resolving definitively, etc.” They were both esoteric, enthymematic conversations and then they became much more directed toward the scene we ended up with and we explored different permutations. It was always going to be that Nora tells the story of going through, but there were a couple different permutations of who she was telling that story to — and then it became very obvious to us that it had to be Kevin. That was locked in before we even started breaking the season premiere. Who were the others that you considered for her telling the story to? Erika Murphy was a contender, and then a grown-up version of Lily who would be maybe a 19- or 20-year-old young woman at the time that this would be taking place. Those were really the only other two contenders, other than Kevin. And how did you land on it being Kevin? Well, it isn’t to say that Kevin isn’t an incredibly important character in The Leftovers — of course he is — but I think the idea is that the third and final season was just as much about Nora’s journey as it was about Kevin’s. His journey would resolve in the penultimate episode and then her journey would resolve in the finale. And that’s inevitable for us because she just lost so much more. He’s been suffering in this kind of existential way. He feels like he’s a coward and he feels like he"

gossipcop-904068,"Multiple women have accused Oscar-winning movie director Paul Haggis of sexual assault. Last month, publicist Haleigh Breest filed a civil suit alleging that the filmmaker, who picked up Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay Academy Awards for 2004’s Crash, of rape. On Friday, three other women came forward to The Associated Press with accusations of sexual misconduct.  Haggis denied the claims in Breest’s suit, which was filed in mid-December, and filed a countersuit, claiming the publicist and her lawyer had attempted to extort $9 million from him in exchange for withholding her suit. Breest claimed that Haggis assaulted her in 2013 after he offered her a ride home after an event, but instead took her to his Manhattan apartment; there, she said, he forced her to perform oral sex on him, fondled her, asked if she enjoyed anal sex and raped her. Haggis’ lawyer, Christine Lepera – who represented producer Dr. Luke in the wake of pop-star Kesha accusing him of sexual assault – said, “He didn’t rape anybody,” in a statement.  “Mr. Haggis denies these anonymous claims in whole. In a society where one of a person’s fundamental rights is the ability to confront an accuser, that right has now been eviscerated when it comes to anyone being charged in the press with any sort of sexual misconduct,” a rep for Haggis said in a statement to Rolling Stone. “Notably, no one has reached out to anyone on Mr. Haggis’ team other than the press to report this. He views the fact that these reports appear to be spearheaded from the law firm representing Ms. Breest, as a further tactic to try to harm him and continue their effort to obtain money … We reiterate our claim against Ms. Breest, and note again that we initiated the legal proceedings, not Ms. Breest.”  The new accusers said they felt empowered to come forward after learning of Breest’s story and seeing women report stories of powerful men engaging in sexual misconduct as part of the #MeToo movement. The women, who all chose to remain anonymous out of fear of retribution, claimed to have stories similar to Breest’s: they were all in their 20s or early 30s and they all said Haggis allegedly attempted to set up private meetings with them to discuss business but subsequently tried to kiss them. Two said that Haggis allegedly became more antagonistic when they resisted him.  A lawyer for Breest did not immediately reply to Rolling Stone‘s request for comment but told The AP that Haggis’ countersuit was “a preposterous and transparent PR stunt that will not succeed” and “a further act of aggression.”  One of the new accusers said she was 28 when the alleged attack took place in 1996. She claims she was working on a television show that Haggis produced when he asked her to review some photos from the show. When they met in a back office, she claimed he tried to kiss her. “He said, ‘Do you really want to continue working?'” she claimed. He then allegedly forced her to perform oral sex on him and pushed her onto the floor and raped her.  Another new accuser said she was in her 30s in the late 2000s when she set up a meeting with Haggis to pitch him on a TV show. She said that Haggis told her that he and his wife had an understanding about extramarital sex and came around a table attempting to kiss her. She ran to her car as Haggis allegedly pursued her, though she was able to drive away.  The last new accuser said she was in her late 20s in 2015 when Haggis allegedly held down her arms, kissed her and followed her into a taxi in Canada. When the cab took her to her apartment, she said Haggis allegedly tossed money at the driver, pursued her and kissed her again before she could get inside and close the door. She said that he then waved at her from outside her residence and claimed that he sent aggressive text messages over the next 24 hours until she blocked him.

""She's still working hard, looking after her health, and doing what's good for her,"" the source notes. ""Justin isn't walking all over her.""  ET previously reported that Gomez’s friends and family, particularly her mother, Mandy Teefey, struggled with the couple’s reunion, given the pair’s ups and downs in the past.

Despite relentless rumors circulating about a split or an alleged break, an exclusive source has revealed to ET that the power couple is still very much committed to their relationship.

With social media buzzing and speculation running rampant, Jelena fans were left anxious and uncertain about the fate of their favorite celebrity duo. However, this breaking news will undoubtedly come as a relief to millions of devoted supporters who have followed their rollercoaster romance over the years.

The secret source, who preferred to remain anonymous, offered reassurance to those concerned Jelena fans, stating unequivocally that the beloved pair is far from breaking up. Despite facing their fair share of challenges and media scrutiny, Gomez and Bieber continue to share a deep connection, bound by love and a mutual desire to make their relationship work.

While the tumultuous nature of their past relationship may have fueled skepticism in some quarters, insiders close to the couple insist that this time their love story has a different tone. Seemingly leaving behind the turbulence of their previous on-again, off-again phases, Gomez and Bieber are now embracing a newfound maturity that strengthens their bond.

As many are aware, the pair's relationship has been under immense scrutiny ever since they first started dating back in 2011. Over the years, they have dealt with tremendous pressure from both the media and their adoring fans, causing emotional strains that threatened to tear them apart. Despite these adversities, Gomez and Bieber's commitment to one another has remained steadfast, navigating the trials and tribulations of a high-profile romance with grace and resilience.

During the lengthy interview on her new movie Mother!, the conversation turned political about halfway through. After discussing the alleged pay gap between men and women, the interviewer asked Lawrence about climate change and the political climate in America.  “I mean when the director was asked about the film, why it was so dark, he said, ‘It’s a mad time to be alive.’ And there is certainly an end of days feeling about it. For many people, in America who would say, [grimaces] perhaps it’s truer there at the moment than anywhere else,” the Channel 4 reporter prompted Lawrence to comment.  “It’s scary,” she responded. “You know, it’s this new language that’s forming, I don’t even recognize it. It’s also scary to know, that climate change is due to human activity, and we continue to ignore it, and the only voice that we really have is through voting,” Lawrence stated.  “And you have voted very recently, as a country” the interviewer acknowledged.  “And we voted, and it was really startling,” Lawrence added. She then insinuated that the hurricanes were “Mother Nature’s rage and wrath” at America for Trump.  “You know you’re watching these hurricanes now, and it’s really hard especially while promoting this movie, not to feel mother nature’s rage and wrath,” she stated.  “It’s not just about climate change though is it, in America? It seems to be a time of huge division,” the reporter added.  “Yeah, it’s really polarizing and upsetting. You know I’ve heard things and seen things on T.V. in my own country that devastate me and make me sick, and it’s just really confusing,” Lawrence stated.  “Do you find President Trump confusing?” the reporter pressed further.  “I don’t find him confusing. I think I know exactly what he is,” Lawrence said solemnly before smirking.  Wrapping up the interview, the reporter asked Lawrence how she felt about the future.

Up till tpo that moment Crazy Jo-lie had kept Brad far from Jen. Make no mistake about it. Her frantic traveling all over the place was an attempt at keeping Pitt away from her and and any other person who might think they were a friend. She can't stand anyone but her having anything to do with Pitt . Including his own family. I knew it would backfire one day. Brad what took so long????? She suffers from an extreme mental illness. She doesn't have the kids in school for the same reason.  I do believe she thought it would last. Seeing how sexy and pretty she thinks she is. A man should and would do anything she tells them to.  I am under the impression her treatment of her surrogate Holly had a sort of wake up call to Pitt as to how utterly evil she is. You can bet she dismissed her like a piece of shite. A woman who carried twins for her. Started making Brad see her game of using and abusing.  And when Jen said her and Brad talk all the time on the phone you know that was news to little miss do as I say not as I do Angelina still talks to her ex's Jo-LIE.    Guess all the years of trying to force Brad to believe Jen was a shallow no good woman has a way of catching up to one. It took this long for Pitt to see just what had truly happened. Her spells have lost the power to confuse.In Touch said she has a terrible jealous streak and can't stand Brad even looking at a woman SHE DEEMS ATTRACTIVE IN ANY WAY. WE ALL KNOW HOW MUCH FUN THAT CAN BE.    The National Enquirer  Says Brad is so happy to have a separation from her.Brad's closest friends are woman and that drives Angelina nuts she hates sharing him  He was mad she took the salt role because she had promised him she would stay at home and be a mom.  I mean you can see her doing whatever she damn well wanted to. And he went along with it. But they have twin babies and my guess is she spends very little time bonding with them. What woman would not want to be able to stay with her new little babies. Not this woman. Sick behavior for sure. And the only thing keeping Brad from making it final is the kids.  Angie be careful what you wish for. Seems like 6 kids are going to be without a mom and dad in one place. Good luck with that",1,en,"Postby Guest » Sun Jun 14, 2009 3:22 pm So things started going downhill after Jen was at the academy Awards show.","Title: Jennifer's Appearance at the Academy Awards Marks the Beginning of a Downward Spiral

In a sudden turn of events, Jennifer's attendance at the prestigious Academy Awards ceremony seems to have acted as a catalyst for a series of unfortunate incidents that have turned her life upside down. The glamorous glitz and glamour of Hollywood's biggest night proved to be the starting point of a downward spiral for the once-promising star.

Following her presence at the Academy Awards show, Jennifer's life took an unexpected and distressing turn, leaving family, friends, and fans in a state of shock and disbelief. Encountering obstacles that seemed insurmountable, her journey since that fateful evening has been marred by a string of misfortunes.

While the Academy Awards, popularly known as the Oscars, have served as a launching pad for many successful careers, Jen's experiences have been far from favorable. It appears that the auspicious event, which should have brought her recognition and applause, instead became the harbinger of her subsequent misfortunes.

The normally composed and radiant Jennifer seemed to have caught the attention of a malevolent force that brought nothing but suffering and pain in its wake. The dark cloud that hovered over her life obscured the previously shining future she had envisioned for herself post-Academy Awards.

Since that night, Jen's once-promising career has taken a nosedive. Her professional projects have encountered countless setbacks, leaving her in professional limbo. The opportunities she had expected to flow abundantly have become scarce, pushing her towards the periphery of her chosen industry.

Furthermore, her personal life has suffered greatly as well. Relationships that once held the promise of love and happiness have crumbled under the weight of unseen forces. Jen's closest allies have witnessed her gradual descent into despair, as she struggles to regain the momentum she once possessed.

The root cause of this unfortunate chain of events, which ignited following her attendance at the Academy Awards, remains a mystery. Some speculate that there might be an underlying curse associated with the ceremony, while others attribute her misfortunes to mere coincidence.

Regardless of the cause, Jennifer's life has transformed from a fairy tale to a nightmare, with each passing day amplifying her desolation. The once-vibrant star, who once captivated audiences with her beauty and talent, now finds herself navigating the treacherous waters of public scrutiny and personal demons.

As Jennifer battles to overcome the obstacles that threaten to consume her dreams, she remains an enduring symbol of hope for those facing their own challenges. Despite the gloomy prospects looming over her, true strength lies in her relentless determination to rise above adversity and reclaim her former glory.

Only time will tell if the seemingly innocuous Academy Awards event was indeed the triggering point for Jennifer's seemingly unstoppable descent into misfortune. In the meanwhile, supporters and fans can only hope that this talented artist will find the strength to overcome the shadows that have cast a pall over her life, and once again shine brightly on both the silver screen and in her personal endeavours."

There comes a time in every couple's relationship when the question of moving in together becomes impossible to ignore. And when those two lovebirds have been stepping out for 15 months — even though they live 3,500 miles apart; he in the UK, she in Canada — it's not so much a case of 'if' as of 'when' they will settle down. So it comes as no surprise that Prince Harry, 33, and his actress girlfriend Meghan Markle, 36, are said to be house-hunting. £7.25million - North Aston Manor, Oxfordshire: This eight bedroom property, overlooking the stunning Cherwell Valley, has seven reception rooms, a spa, swimming pool and 18.2 acres with equestrian facilities. It's nine miles from Soho Farmhouse and swanky shopping centre Bicester Village, should Meghan fancy snapping up some designer bargains Prince Harry and actress girlfriend Meghan Markle were pictured together at the Invictus Games in Toronto last month Royal sources have exclusively told the Daily Mail that the royal couple are looking in Oxfordshire and are particularly interested in high-end properties tucked away in the rolling Cotswold hills. A good friend of Harry's says the Prince, whose father's residence, Highgrove House, is in the south Cotswolds, has a long-standing affection for the area, while Meghan is said to be entranced by its rustic charm. 'He is searching for a new home in the area,' the friend reveals. 'Before Meghan, he was vaguely looking in Norfolk, but didn't find what he wanted. Now, with her input, he's renewed his search.' £2million - The Old Rectory, Lower Brailes, Oxfordshire: A stunning wood-panelled property dating from the 14th century, this boasts eight bedrooms, a sun-drenched terrace and its own private lake, complete with duck house. There’s a three-bedroom coach house for guests and it’s set at the end of a no-through road. Certainly, the lush green countryside encompassing swathes of Warwickshire, Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire is a huge draw for London-dwellers eager to snap up rural boltholes. Just an hour or so from the capital, it's home (or at least a weekend retreat) to A-listers, politicians and media executives: the Camerons, Beckhams, Kate Moss, Lily Allen and Stella McCartney all have million-pound properties in the area. 'It's like a magnet,' says Sophie Gannon, of Savills Estate Agents in Banbury, Oxfordshire. 'If you get one person, you get them all.' However, Harry isn't following the crowd but listening to his heart. The Cotswolds, and specifically Highgrove, which was bought by his father's private estate in 1980, is where the Prince spent much of his childhood. It was Charles and Diana's weekend home, with 15-acre grounds and, later on, a teenage haven in the cellars of the main house, which Harry nicknamed 'Club H'. £2.95million - Fanthill, Banbury, Oxfordshire: Accessed through electric gates, up a winding driveway, this eight-bedroom house sits among 20 acres of land, so ticks all Harry’s boxes when it comes to privacy. There’s a heated outdoor pool, miniature golf course and a carp lake, where the young lovebirds could row off the private pier A local who knows the family says: 'It's not surprising that Harry would like to live where he feels at home. 'He's lived in the Cotswolds all his life and often returns to visit his father. After his mother died, it became a place of sanctuary. 'When the boys entered their teens, Charles bought several homes in the area, thinking they might want one in the future.' Ten years ago, Charles bought up properties adjacent to his sprawling estate, paying £2 million apiece for nearby manor houses and farm buildings.

While some women are able to lose pregnancy weight and regain their figures through diet and exercise, most women experience physical changes that may require additional help.  Fortunately, plastic surgeons are able to perform a mommy makeover to address sagging breasts, loose abdominal muscles and skin, and excess fat in the abdomen, flanks, hips, and thighs.  For most patients, a mommy makeover is something that they want to do to look and feel better about themselves.  Women may have friends that have had this procedure or know of celebrities or social media stars that have had a surgical body transformation. Such is the case with Teen Mom’s star Briana DeJesus, who recently underwent a Mommy Makeover procedure.  What Is a Mommy Makeover?  A mommy makeover includes several plastic surgeries, which may be performed at once, to help women reshape and contour their bodies after they have given birth.  Many patients will be treated with a breast lift, breast augmentation, tummy tuck, liposuction, and other body contouring treatments.  Who’s a Good Candidate?  Most plastic surgeons recommend that women have a mommy makeover once they are finished having children.  Many female patients may begin considering this series of surgeries anytime during their child-bearing years, but may delay treatment until after their last pregnancy.  Additionally, women that are breast-feeding will often wait until they have transitioned their child to a bottle or solid foods, before undergoing any type of surgery.  What Surgeries Are Involved?  A breast lift can tighten breast issue, remove excess skin, and resize or reposition the breast and areola for a perkier appearance. Women, especially those that breast feed, may also have a breast augmentation to address volume loss.  An abdominoplasty or tummy tuck tightens muscles, eliminates saggy skin, and creates a new belly button to restore feminine curves and a streamlined silhouette.  Additionally, liposuction may be perfumed on one or more areas of the body to target excess fat, and a Brazilian butt lift can boost a women’s less than pert backside.  For DeJesus, her doctor combined a tummy tuck with a breast lift.  “I did a tummy tuck, a breast lift with an implant exchange because she did have implants from before—she wanted to be smaller, higher and perkier—so we changed her implants out for smaller ones,” said Dr. Miami, via E! News. “And we also did some contouring and reshaping of her booty, of her shape overall. We did that, I think it was a week ago Monday.”  Recovery  Depending on the number of procedures, women may have one to four weeks of downtime following a mommy makeover. They can expect to be evaluated by their surgeon several times during this period.  Patients will receive detailed post-operative instructions from their treating physician including exercise and other physical restrictions. They will continue to be under the care of their plastic surgeon for routine follow-ups over the next 12-18 months.  Additionally, it’s important for patients to have physical and emotional support from their significant other, family, and friends during the recovery process.

While some women are able to lose pregnancy weight and regain their figures through diet and exercise, most women experience physical changes that may require additional help.  Fortunately, plastic surgeons are able to perform a mommy makeover to address sagging breasts, loose abdominal muscles and skin, and excess fat in the abdomen, flanks, hips, and thighs.  For most patients, a mommy makeover is something that they want to do to look and feel better about themselves.  Women may have friends that have had this procedure or know of celebrities or social media stars that have had a surgical body transformation. Such is the case with Teen Mom’s star Briana DeJesus, who recently underwent a Mommy Makeover procedure.  What Is a Mommy Makeover?  A mommy makeover includes several plastic surgeries, which may be performed at once, to help women reshape and contour their bodies after they have given birth.

gossipcop-2365987922,"Jenny and her silk pillowcases.  It’s no secret that Jennifer Lopez-at 48-has a body that won’t quit and skin that needs to be studied so we can all age like the goddess she is.  Dramatic? Not even close.  And while a lot of it may be down to great genes, Lopez has revealed in a new interview some of her beauty secrets and yep, they’re as diva as you might expect.  Lopez credits her glow to positive affirmations, revealing she says one in particular to herself every day to keep her radiant, youthful look intact.  So what is this magic phrase?  “I am youthful and timeless at every age,” Lopez says every single day—but it’s not enough to just say the mantra daily, because Lopez also has a handful of pillows with these words and more mantras embroidered into them all over her home. “I tell myself that every day, a few times a day. It sounds like clichéd bullshit, but it’s not: Age is all in your mind. Look at Jane Fonda.”  Lopez continues, “The affirmations are everywhere. I forget that they’re all here. They’re just part of the house now.”  Before you scoff at Lopez’s positivity there is a school of thought that believes negative thoughts can age you. Australian-born Dr Blackburn, a Nobel Prize winner, co-authored The Telomere Effect: A Revolutionary Approach to Living Younger, Healthier, Longer, with anti-aging psychologist Dr Elissa Epel, which investigated the link between telomeres, which protect our chromosomes, and the effect stress, sleep and diet can have on telomeres and how that directly corresponds with our health.  The book asserts there is a correlation between depression and anxiety and shorter telomeres and that “when pessimists develop an aging-related illness, like cancer or heart disease, the illness tends to progress faster.”  And really there's only so far a little highlight can go, step one is all about a positive attitude. Step two is to find yourself a great pillowcase and settle on your new mantra.  So what’s the lesson here? Your inner glow is only a glass half full attitude away.",1,en,Jenny and her silk pillowcases. It’s no secret that Jennifer Lopez-at 48-has a body that won’t quit and skin that needs to be studied so we can all age like the goddess she is.,"Title: Jennifer Lopez Reveals Secret to Her Enviable Looks: Silk Pillowcases

Renowned artist and actress Jennifer Lopez, at the age of 48, has long been admired for her timeless beauty and youthful appearance. Her flawless skin, sculpted physique, and radiant glow have become the topics of envy and fascination for many. As the world looks for answers on how to defy the natural process of aging, an unexpected secret to Lopez's age-defying looks has recently come to light - silk pillowcases.

Lopez, often referred to as a ""goddess"" by her countless admirers, has never shied away from sharing her health and beauty routines, constantly inspiring her followers to embrace self-care and prioritize skincare. In her latest revelation, the renowned artist credited her silk pillowcases as an essential element in her daily beauty regimen.

While the mention of silk pillowcases might initially sound trivial or insignificant, experts claim that they possess unique properties that can significantly enhance the skin's health and appearance during sleep. Unlike traditional cotton pillowcases, silk fabric minimizes friction between the skin and the pillow, reducing the likelihood of wrinkles, creases, and overall skin damage caused by constant rubbing or compression.

Moreover, silk pillowcases also have the added benefit of being gentle on hair strands, mitigating the risk of hair breakage, split ends, and reducing frizz. By keeping hair smoother and reducing static buildup during sleep, silk allows individuals to wake up to a more manageable and graceful mane, much like Jennifer Lopez herself.

The revelation of Silk pillowcases as an integral part of Lopez's beauty routine has intrigued skincare experts and enthusiasts worldwide. Various opinion leaders in the beauty industry have started touting silk pillowcases as an unconventional yet transformative tool for achieving skin rejuvenation and preserving youthful appearances.

Dr. Sarah Montgomery, a prominent dermatologist, explains the science behind this newfound beauty secret: ""Silk pillowcases enable the skin to glide across the fabric, causing minimal friction. This friction reduction can prevent sleep lines and potential wrinkles. Moreover, silk is a natural moisture-retaining material, resulting in better hydration for the skin overnight.""

The skincare community is buzzing with excitement, with beauty bloggers and enthusiasts eager to follow Lopez's lead and incorporate silk pillowcases into their nighttime routines. Numerous brands have already seized this opportunity, launching their own lines of silk pillowcases to cater to the growing demand.

In conclusion, Jennifer Lopez's commitment to maintaining her stunning looks has never faltered, and her revelation regarding silk pillowcases as a skin-transforming secret further cements her status as a beauty icon. As fans worldwide eagerly follow in her footsteps, embracing the beauty of this unassuming yet powerful fabric, it is clear that the timeless allure of Jennifer Lopez will continue to captivate and inspire for generations to come."

Each time Channing and Jenna head to mediation to discuss the terms of their divorce, “they can’t seem to agree on anything,” says a source. “Their meetings have been contentious.” One big issue: their five-year-old daughter, Everly. “They can’t agree on custody,” a friend tells In Touch exclusively.      Unicorns do exist. A post shared by Channing Tatum (@channingtatum) on May 4, 2018 at 6:40pm PDT      “They’re both working hard to do what’s in the best interest of their daughter, but it’s just taking way longer than they both expected because they can’t agree on the small details.” Another sticking point: Channing’s estimated $60 million fortune. Though Jenna, 37, has had a successful movie and TV career with shows like Supergirl, Channing, 38, has starred in several blockbusters, such as Magic Mike and 21 Jump Street, and was the family’s main breadwinner. “Jenna has told friends that she gave Channing the best years of her life,” says the source, “and now she’s trying to negotiate a very secure future for herself.”  There is a lot at stake financially. During the course of their marriage, the pair acquired several assets, including a $6 million Beverly Hills home and pricey cars including a Tesla and a vintage Chevrolet truck. Finding common ground about dividing their stuff “is not easy,” says the friend. “They both want it to be over with.”          Jenna never thought it would come to this. “She isn’t pleased about how it’s all played out so far,” says the source. “She’s bitter. There are days when she’s blaming him for not working harder to save their marriage.” And while she’s told pals that she hopes they can stay friends, adds the source, deep down “she knows that’s never going to happen.”  Channing shouldn’t underestimate Jenna, says the source: “She’s looking out for herself, and at the end of the day she knows that he’s got to pay. She’s not going to walk away quietly.”  For more on this, pick up the latest issue of In Touch — and for more exclusive content sign up for our newsletter.

From “cool pants” to clover emojis, there’s a lot of backstory that needs explaining in order to completely understand everything that went down among Kanye West and Wiz Khalifa and Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna. To keep you informed, Us Weekly has broken it down with a comprehensive timeline of events. Kanye West Dates Amber Rose In 2008, the Grammy-winning rapper started a relationship with unknown model Rose after spotting her in Ludacris’ “What Them Girls Like” music video. The pair had a public two-year romance. Amber Rose Breaks Up With Kanye West In mid-2010, Rose called things off with West. A year after the split, Rose appeared on The Wendy Williams Show, noting, “[Kanye] said that he was an a-hole and he was mean to me and he didn’t treat me the way he was supposed to. I accepted his apology because I feel like he’s remorseful for how he treated me.” Blac Chyna and Tyga Have a Son, Get Engaged Meanwhile, an up-and-coming rapper named Tyga welcomed a baby boy named King Cairo Stevenson with his then-girlfriend, model Blac Chyna, in October 2012. “Most amazing feeling ever. #Blessed #2Kings,” Tyga captioned a Twitter photo cradling his little boy. That December, the couple confirmed they were engaged in an Instagram post featuring Chyna’s giant diamond ring. Kanye West Starts Dating Kim Kardashian Fresh off his split from Rose, West set his sights on his longtime friend and crush Kim Kardashian in early 2012. The pair were spotted out together and Kardashian’s famous family even started pressing the reality star for details on her new romance (remember when he let her borrow his car?!). Kanye West Raps About Wiz Khalifa, Amber Rose As West’s romance with Kardashian blossomed, so did that of his ex Rose and her new rapper fiancé, Wiz Khalifa. In April 2012, West released the song “Cold” in which he rapped, “Only n—a I got respect for is Wiz / And I’ll admit, I had fell in love with Kim around the same time she had fell in love with him.” Amber Rose Marries Wiz Khalifa After Welcoming Son Sebastian In February 2013, Rose and Khalifa had their first child, son Sebastian, announcing the news on Twitter.

Rob Kardashian Skips the Wedding, Remains Under the Radar Things got awkward when Kim’s younger brother, Rob Kardashian, left Kim’s wedding festivities early. His exit followed months of erratic behavior: avoiding appearances on the family’s reality series, Keeping Up With the Kardashians, significant weight gain and depression. He’s stayed out of the public eye ever since. “He sent me a long email the morning of [saying] that he was going to leave,” Kim later said on Watch What Happens Live. “There was no fight.” Blac Chyna and Tyga Split In August 2014, the parents called it quits. “They are trying to keep it amicable,” ",1,en,"In the immortal words of Hilary Duff, “Let’s go back, back to the beginning.” January 2016 played host to a series of Kardashian-Jenner-West-Rose-Chyna feuds that have been years in the making.","In the immortal words of Hilary Duff, ""Let's go back, back to the beginning,"" January 2016 witnessed the inception of a series of unprecedented feuds involving the Kardashian-Jenner-West-Rose-Chyna clans, marking the culmination of years' worth of simmering tensions.

The highly publicized clashes that unfolded in January 2016 brought to light the intricate web of relationships, loyalties, and grievances that have been silently brewing within these intertwined families. As the disputes erupted into the public domain, it became increasingly apparent that this was not simply a case of petty quarrels but rather a complex tapestry of intergenerational conflicts.

The origins of these feuds can be traced back to earlier years, where the merging paths of the Kardashian-Jenner and West-Rose-Chyna families led to intertwining connections and intertwined destinies. The amalgamation of these high-profile figures created a breeding ground for both camaraderie and discord, gradually unraveling the tightly woven threads that once bonded them.

January 2016, however, marked a turning point in these relationships, as previously held tensions surged to the surface, captivating the attention of audiences worldwide. The onset of the clashes can be attributed to a myriad of factors, ranging from personal differences, professional rivalries, and clashing ambitions.

The divisive nature of these feuds has been evident in various public exchanges, fueled by social media interactions and sporadic outbursts. Each incident unfolded like a carefully choreographed spectacle, drawing the attention of both devoted fans and disapproving critics, as the media eagerly embraced the unfolding drama.

While the reasons behind the disputes may seem frivolous to some, the implications are far-reaching, as they expose the vulnerabilities and insecurities that exist even within the ranks of the rich and famous. These conflicts provide a unique lens through which society can contemplate the often intangible nature of fame and the accompanying price of being in the public eye.

As the Kardashian-Jenner-West-Rose-Chyna feuds continue to monopolize headlines, it remains to be seen whether common ground can eventually be found, or whether this clash of personalities will continue to escalate. The world watches with bated breath, eager to see if these highly influential figures can reconcile their differences or if the feuds will persist, forever etching January 2016 into the annals of pop culture as a defining moment of generational strife."

A source told MailOnline: 'Cheryl basically went into hibernation when she got pregnant and has made the decision to be a stay at home mother with no nanny and is looking after bear herself. She doesn’t like going out much as she used to.'  Fans have recently questioned why the couple have not been pictured on social media together since August last year.  Fans of the couple are concerned that they haven't been pictured together since August  The last time they were seen in public was at The X Factor last October.  A friend Cheryl said: 'The fact of the matter is, like most young couple's with busy work lives and the demands of an infant they have been struggling to spend time together.  'There are the very real strains of trying to adapt to parenthood whilst being in the spotlight and having to appear as though everything is rosy all of the time.  'It is not real life and is not the life Cheryl and Liam are currently living as a couple.'  Cheryl has been supported by her brother Gary and his partner, who she has moved into Liam's home in Woking.  The Fight for this Love star sparked engagement rumours by showing off a whopping diamond on her ring finger during The Prince's Trust gala last Thursday. She has since been seen without the ring.  The source added: 'Cheryl just wants what every woman wants. A loving, happy family and someone to grow old with.  'There is no doubt she wants more children - but it is fair to say at the moment there is a lot of pressure on both her and Liam. Being apart isn't helping that.'  The couple's lack of public outings together has already puzzled fans. One tweeted: 'Hey @LiamPayne the last (time) you posted a selfie on Instagram with Cheryl was August last year.  Could you bless us with a new one please Liam. @CherylOfficial.' Another follower wrote: '@CherylOfficial hello, I miss your selfies with liam x'.  Instead of a picture of Cheryl, Liam posted this photograph of Bear on Wednesday with the caption: 'Happy Valentine's Day @cherylofficial and everyone. Looks like I've got the big guy to compete with now.'

In a turn that has left fans and onlookers bewildered, the seemingly harmonious relationship shared between pop sensations Cheryl Cole and Liam Payne has reportedly encountered a strain. A close friend, choosing to remain anonymous, has claimed that Payne's regular nights away from home have caused tension within the once blissful couple, as Cole finds herself shouldering the responsibility of caring for their cherished baby son.

Sources close to the power couple have disclosed that their relationship, which has captivated millions, is now facing the crossroads of parenthood versus individual aspirations. The friend, privy to the inner workings of their lives, expressed concerns regarding the duo's current dynamic.

Payne's recent absence from the marital home has raised eyebrows among those closest to the couple, leading to speculation that their once solid foundation may be starting to buckle under the pressures of a dual career lifestyle. The untiring dedication exhibited by Cole toward their infant child seems to be inadvertently highlighting this apparent rift.

With the revelation of this rumored strain, fans are left wondering whether this is a mere hiccup that can be overcome or if it foreshadows a more significant challenge in the couple's journey together.

Cole, renowned for her endearing charm and resilient spirit, has not publicly addressed these claims, choosing to focus on the love and devotion she pours into motherhood.

gossipcop-9639077061,"Ivanka Trump is becoming one of the most powerful first children in American History – despite not having an official job in the Trump administration. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) Ivanka Trump’s products weren’t always the hottest items online. In January, for instance, the first daughter’s fashion line ranked No. 550 based on the number of orders from Lyst, the biggest fashion e-commerce website in the world, according to Forbes. That changed dramatically the following month. Sales of Trump’s products skyrocketed in early February, making her Lyst’s 11th most popular brand. The biggest spike, according to Lyst, came on Feb. 9, when sales jumped by 219 percent from the day before. Yes, Feb. 9 — the same day that White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted Trump’s clothing and jewelry line on “Fox & Friends.” “Go buy Ivanka’s stuff is what I would tell you,” Conway said. “I’m going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody.” And viewers did, apparently. Sales of Ivanka Trump’s branded products skyrocketed on Feb. 9, the same day White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted the line on Fox News. (Lyst) Abigail Klem, president of the Ivanka Trump brand, said in a statement that “the beginning of February” shows “the best performing weeks in the history of the brand.” “For several different retailers, Ivanka Trump was a top performer online, and in some of the categories it was the best performance ever,” Klem said. Sarah Tanner, Lyst’s spokeswoman, said increases in sales are usually tied to current events. For instance, interest in pantsuits went up by 460 percent last year because of Hillary Clinton’s affinity for the style, she said. Sales of the first daughter’s products went up by 86 percent in November when her father won the presidential election, according to the company. Conway has come under fire for touting Ivanka Trump's clothing line during a televised interview. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) [A Trump wine boycott backfires spectacularly] But the brand was “largely featured” in the news in February, Tanner said. Conway gave her on-air endorsement of Ivanka Trump’s brand after President Trump had complained on Twitter that his daughter had “been treated so unfairly” by the department store Nordstrom, which dropped her clothing line over slow sales. “It would not be a surprise to us if it resulted in the increase in sales,” Tanner said of Conway’s Fox interview. “I think that’s one of the reasons the brand was largely in the news and could have attributed to this increase.” Conway did not respond to an email requesting comment. Her promotion of the fashion line appeared to violate an ethics rule barring federal employees from using their public office to endorse products and immediately drew criticism from both Democrats and Republicans. [Where does the Ivanka Trump brand go from here?] Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said Conway’s comments were “absolutely wrong, wrong, wrong” and “clearly over the line,” The Washington Post reported. The White House later said that Conway had been “counseled.” But concerns about her comments remain. On Thursday, the government’s top ethics official criticized the White House for not disciplining Conway, The Post’s Drew Harwell reported. Walter M. Shaub Jr., director of the Office of Government Ethics, had urged officials last month to reprimand the White House counsel but was rebuffed. On Thursday he wrote to Stefan C. Passantino, who handles White House ethics issues as the president’s deputy counsel. “When an employee’s conduct violates, disciplinary action serves to deter future misconduct,” Shaub wrote. “Not taking disciplinary action against a senior official under such circumstances risks undermining the ethics program.” [A Trump voter’s message to retailers: ‘Keep your mouths shut about our president’] Last month, a group of law professors filed a professional misconduct complaint against Conway — a",1,en,Ivanka Trump is becoming one of the most powerful first children in American History – despite not having an official job in the Trump administration.,"Headline: Ivanka Trump's Ascension to Power: A Dynamic Force in American History

(Place), (Date) - In an unprecedented turn of events, Ivanka Trump, the eldest daughter of former President Donald J. Trump, has emerged as one of the most influential and powerful first children in American history. Despite her lack of an official role within her father's administration, her unquestionable influence has reshaped the political landscape and left many wondering about the boundaries of power within the highest echelons of governance.

From the outset, it was evident that Ivanka Trump possessed a unique combination of intellect, business acumen, and poise. Although she did not assume an official position, she quickly established herself as an advisor to President Trump, offering her expertise on key matters and providing a valuable voice of reason within the inner circle. 

While many initially speculated on the nature of her influence, it became increasingly clear that Ivanka Trump was not simply an honorary first child but an instrumental figure in shaping pivotal policies. Her advocacy for issues such as women's empowerment, job creation, and workforce development propelled her to the forefront of national conversations and positioned her as a force to be reckoned with.

The undeniable influence of Ivanka Trump extended beyond the confines of the White House. Her entrepreneurial background equipped her with a unique perspective on economic matters, enabling her to forge groundbreaking partnerships and initiatives on a global scale. Her work alongside foreign leaders and dignitaries set a new standard for diplomacy, often establishing a foundation for impactful international agreements.

Moreover, Ivanka Trump established herself as a champion for brand America, seamlessly combining her familial role with commercial ventures. Her commitment to public service, combined with her extensive business acumen, resulted in unprecedented opportunities for American companies abroad, boosting both national and international economies. 

However, as with any rise to power, Ivanka Trump's increasing influence has not been without controversy. Detractors argue that her prominent role blurs the lines between government and private interests, raising concerns about nepotism and favoritism. Critics insist that an official appointment within the administration would provide the necessary transparency and accountability that the American people rightfully demand. 

Despite the ongoing debates surrounding her influence, there is no denying the seismic impact Ivanka Trump has had on shaping American history. Already, her contributions have opened new doors, challenged traditional notions of power dynamics within presidential families, and captivated a nation weary of the establishment. Whether detractors or supporters, the nation cannot escape the reality that Ivanka Trump has etched her name in the annals of American leadership – a testament to her tenacity, intellect, and political finesse.

As the Trump era recedes into history, Ivanka Trump's undeniable influence has solidified her place among the most powerful first children in American history. Her dynamic presence and compelling policy initiatives will continue to shape the nation's discourse long after her time in the White House. The legacy of Ivanka Trump, a woman who blazed her own path to prominence, will undoubtedly leave an indelible mark on the landscape of American politics."

Speaking on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on US TV on Tuesday night, the actor finally put an end to the long-running saga of will he/won’t he play the character for a fifth time.  “I have been quite cagey about it. I have been doing interviews all day and people have been asking me and I think I’ve been rather coy. But kind of felt like if I was going to speak the truth I should speak truth to you.”  Asked by Colbert directly whether he could deliver some “good news” about returning as Bond, Craig finally replied: “Yes.”  He revealed he had known for a “couple of months”, adding: “We’ve been discussing it, we’ve just been trying to figure things out. I always wanted to, I needed a break.”  However, he was keen to reiterate it would indeed be his last outing as the lothario spy. “I think this is it. I just want to go out on a high note and I can’t wait,” he said.  It is not surprising news, as his return was first reported in July.

We’re done. All I want to do is move on,” he said, adding: “If I did another Bond movie, it would only be for the money.”  But explaining his heated comments, Craig told Colbert that they had been made in the moment, two days after Spectre had finished shooting when he was exhausted. “Instead of saying something with style and grace, I said something really stupid,” he said.  It is the source of much speculation of how much the film studios will have promised Craig to tempt him back.

gossipcop-780888,"Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge wasn’t always a royal, but even before her marriage to Prince William, Kate Middleton had an impressive net worth.  Middleton had a comfortable upbringing before she became the first commoner to join the royal family after she married William in 2011. But Middleton’s net worth ballooned once she became a duchess.  Here’s everything we know about Middleton’s net worth:  What is Kate Middleton’s net worth?  The 36 year-old mother of three — who gave birth to a second baby boy in April — is worth at least £5 million, or $7 million, according to global wealth-tracking firm Wealth-X, though some estimates put her net worth as high as £7.3 million, or $10 million. Middleton’s wealth is mostly in cash because she doesn’t have a personal portfolio of property or artwork.  That being said, Middleton’s net worth is a lot less than her prince — Wealth-X estimates Prince William’s net worth is at least $30 million, though some reports put his fortune closer to $40 million. According to Wealth-X, $19 million of Prince William’s wealth is in cash. The wealth tracking firm also noted that William has an expensive helicopter fit for a royal — an Augusta A109S Grand helicopter which is valued at $11 million.  Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, Prince George of Cambridge and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge arrive for a children's party for Military families during the Royal Tour of Canada on September 29, 2016 in Victoria, Canada. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  What do we know about Kate Middleton’s money?  Most of Middleton’s net worth stems from Party Pieces, an online party supplies business started by her parents. The company is estimated to be worth around £30 million, or $50 million, thanks in no small part to the exposure it gets from being associated with the royals, according to royal expert Marlene Koenig.  Prior to her life as a full-time duchess, Middleton worked for the family business and was a part-time accessories buyer for a retailer called Jigsaw.  Growing up, Kate and her two siblings, Pippa and James Middleton, attended expensive privates schools from a young age, with years of tuition for just one child estimated to be at least £250,000, or $350,000. Kate met Prince William while in college in Scotland at the prestigious University of St. Andrew’s. She graduated in 2005 with a degree in Art History.  How did Kate Middleton’s net worth change after marrying Prince William?  Joining the royal family meant that Middleton was marrying into an incredible $88 billion fortune amassed over generations.  Before Will and Kate became the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and moved into a 20-room apartment in Kensington Palace, Kate lived in an apartment purchased by her parents in the Chelsea neighborhood of London believed to be worth £1 million, or $1.4 million.  Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge smile following their marriage at Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011 in London, England. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  But once Kate officially became a royal she didn’t need to spend much of her own money anymore. Most of her living costs are covered by the private estate Prince Charles manages, the Duchy of Cornwall. The revenue from the Duchy of Cornwall pays for the most of Prince Charles and his family’s royal expenses: things like official travel, wardrobe, housing and staff costs. When Meghan Markle marries Prince Harry on May 19, she too, will get to keep most of her own money — her net worth is believed to be about $5 million — as the Duchy of Cornwall will also absorb the majority of her living costs associated with royal responsibilities.  What is the ‘Kate effect’?  As the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate sets fashion trends all over the world. While she herself does not retain any income from the flurry of economic activity set off by the designer clothes she wears for public appearances, she has triggered what is known as “the Kate Effect,” ",0,en,0,"Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge wasn’t always a royal, but even before her marriage to Prince William, Kate Middleton had an impressive net worth.  Middleton had a comfortable upbringing before she became the first commoner to join the royal family after she married William in 2011. But Middleton’s net worth ballooned once she became a duchess.  Here’s everything we know about Middleton’s net worth:  What is Kate Middleton’s net worth?  The 36 year-old mother of three — who gave birth to a second baby boy in April — is worth at least £5 million, or $7 million, according to global wealth-tracking firm Wealth-X, though some estimates put her net worth as high as £7.3 million, or $10 million. Middleton’s wealth is mostly in cash because she doesn’t have a personal portfolio of property or artwork.  That being said, Middleton’s net worth is a lot less than her prince — Wealth-X estimates Prince William’s net worth is at least $30 million, though some reports put his fortune closer to $40 million. According to Wealth-X, $19 million of Prince William’s wealth is in cash. The wealth tracking firm also noted that William has an expensive helicopter fit for a royal — an Augusta A109S Grand helicopter which is valued at $11 million.

Chris Jackson—Getty Images  What do we know about Kate Middleton’s money?  Most of Middleton’s net worth stems from Party Pieces, an online party supplies business started by her parents. The company is estimated to be worth around £30 million, or $50 million, thanks in no small part to the exposure it gets from being associated with the royals, according to royal expert Marlene Koenig.  Prior to her life as a full-time duchess, Middleton worked for the family business and was a part-time accessories buyer for a retailer called Jigsaw.  Growing up, Kate and her two siblings, Pippa and James Middleton, attended expensive privates schools from a young age, with years of tuition for just one child estimated to be at least £250,000, or $350,000. Kate met Prince William while in college in Scotland at the prestigious University of St. Andrew’s. She graduated in 2005 with a degree in Art History.  How did Kate Middleton’s net worth change after marrying Prince William?  Joining the royal family meant that Middleton was marrying into an incredible $88 billion fortune amassed over generations.  Before Will and Kate became the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and moved into a 20-room apartment in Kensington Palace, Kate lived in an apartment purchased by her parents in the Chelsea neighborhood of London believed to be worth £1 million, or $1.4 million.

Chris Jackson—Getty Images  But once Kate officially became a royal she didn’t need to spend much of her own money anymore. Most of her living costs are covered by the private estate Prince Charles manages, the Duchy of Cornwall. The revenue from the Duchy of Cornwall pays for the most of Prince Charles and his family’s royal expenses: things like official travel, wardrobe, housing and staff costs. When Meghan Markle marries Prince Harry on May 19, she too, will get to keep most of her own money — her net worth is believed to be about $5 million — as the Duchy of Cornwall will also absorb the majority of her living costs associated with royal responsibilities.

In a stunning announcement yesterday, President Donald Trump declared his administration's decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord. The global agreement aimed at addressing the escalating threat of climate change has, for years, been recognized as a significant milestone in the fight against environmental destruction.

As news of this momentous decision reverberated across the world, it was no surprise that Hollywood's finest seized the opportunity to voice their concerns and engage in the discourse surrounding this unparalleled environmental setback. Known for their influence and proactive stance on numerous social issues, Hollywood celebrities and environmental activists were swift to respond and demonstrate unwavering support for climate change initiatives.

Highlighting their commitment to combating climate change, influential figures from the entertainment industry expressed their disappointment in President Trump's contentious move. Leading environmental advocates, whose megaphones reach millions, utilized various platforms at their disposal to articulate the urgency and enormity of the issue.

Some of the most recognizable faces in cinema, including actors Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo, took to social media to voice their dismay and call for immediate action. DiCaprio's impassioned plea on Twitter reiterated the call to prioritize the environment over political divisiveness, emphasizing the necessity of collective global responsibility to protect our planet for future generations. Meanwhile, Ruffalo rallied his followers on Instagram with a heartfelt plea, urging them not to lose hope but to channel their outrage into positive action.

Beyond social media, Hollywood's response extended into real-world activism. Stars such as Jane Fonda and Susan Sarandon participated in protests across major cities, championing the Paris climate accord and advocating for its continuation despite the withdrawal of their own government. These celebrated individuals lent their fame and prominence to the cause, rallying both their fellow celebrities and ordinary citizens to raise their voices and demand environmental justice.

Hollywood's timely response has reiterated the importance of unity in such trying times. By harnessing their significant influence and reach, celebrities have managed to captivate public attention and drive meaningful discussion about climate change. Their activism serves as a reminder that the battle to protect our planet transcends political divisions and requires a collective effort where Hollywood, with its global appeal, plays a crucial role.

As President Trump's decision looms as a potential setback for global environmental progress, it is more critical than ever that Hollywood's impassioned voice continues to advocate for preserving the Paris climate accord. The relentless commitment shown thus far by these influential figures and activists serves as an inspiration, igniting hope among citizens and reminding the world that united, we hold the power to withstand any obstacle in pursuit of a sustainable future."

Sony is handling distribution.  The movie will hit theaters on Aug. 9, 2019, Variety has learned. Opening on the 50th anniversary of the day that the Manson family committed the LaBianca murders and the day after Tate was killed, the film will head off against “Artemis Fowl,” Disney’s adaptation of the popular sci-fi and fantasy series.

As previously reported, Tom Cruise is also being pursued to star in the director’s ninth feature. Sources now tell Variety that Tarantino is interested in casting Al Pacino in the film as well. Sony is handling distribution.  The movie will hit theaters on Aug. 9, 2019, Variety has learned. Opening on the 50th anniversary of the day that the Manson family committed the LaBianca murders and the day after Tate was killed, the film will head off against “Artemis Fowl,” Disney’s adaptation of the popular sci-fi and fantasy series.  Sony beat out several bidders, including Warner Bros. and Paramount, for rights to the film. The movie — shrouded in secrecy — is set in 1969 and is believed to involve Charles Manson and the Manson family murders. The director has told media outlets that it’s not a biopic, but is an ensemble film set during the tumultuous time period. It’s the first pic that Tarantino is releasing without the Weinstein Company. A group of investors led by Maria Contreras-Sweet is in a strong position to buy the Weinstein Company following sexual misconduct allegations against its disgraced founder Harvey Weinstein.  Deadline Hollywood first reported the news."

gossipcop-911679,"EXCLUSIVE: In a very competitive situation, Netflix has landed The Politician, a new hourlong comedy series from longtime collaborators Brad Falchuk, Ian Brennan and Ryan Murphy, I have learned. The project, starring Tony winner Ben Platt (Dear Evan Hansen), with Oscar winners Barbra Streisand and Gwyneth Paltrow in negotiations to co-star, has received a two-season straight-to-series order, I hear.  The deal, believed to be the biggest TV package sale of the year, came after a weeklong bidding war among top streaming players, including Amazon and Hulu, sources said. It gives prolific creator-producer Murphy two series on Netflix, along with the upcoming Ratched.  RESX/Shutterstock  As he does on all of his shows, Murphy will direct the pilot for The Politician, described as a one-hour comedy with social commentary. If Streisand and Paltrow’s deals close, Streisand will be part of the production team as well as directing, with Paltrow also expected to produce. It would be the first major TV series role for both feature actress.  Details about the plot and characters in The Politician are being kept under wraps, but according to a source close to the project, it revolves around the politician aspirations of Platt’s Payton, a wealthy Santa Barbarian, and every season will revolve around a different political race his character is involved in.  Rex/Shutterstock  I hear that Platt will have musical numbers in several episodes of the show. That, along with the potential involvement of Paltrow and Streisand, helped drive interest in the project, sparking a heated bidding and leading to the big Netflix deal.  Frequent collaborators Falchuk and Murphy had been quietly working on the script for The Politician for the past year. The two brought in their Glee co-creator Brennan, with the three expected to share co-creator credit. Platt also was attached early on and is heavily involved in the casting of the series, which eyes a potential late summer production start.  The project hails from Fox 21 TV Studios under Murphy’s overall deal at 20th Century Fox TV. Its packaging was guided by Fox TV Group chairman Dana Walden, a longtime Murphy collaborator who oversees the studio.  Paltrow previously worked on Falchuk, Murphy and Brennan’s Glee. The actress, who is engaged to Falchuk, won an Emmy for her guest-starring role on Fox’s high school musical dramedy.  The deal for The Politician comes on the heels of the successful launch of Falchuk and Murphy’s latest collaboration, drama series 9-1-1 (co-created with Tim Minear), which has been a breakout hit for Fox and was renewed for a second season only two episodes into its freshman run. The Politician marks Murphy and Falchuk’s fourth television series as co-creators, joining 9-1-1 as well as FX’s American Horror Story and the upcoming Pose (co-created by Steven Canals). Murphy is also the mastermind behind FX’s American Crime Story and Feud as well as Netflix’s upcoming Ratched starring Emmy winner Sarah Paulson (AHS franchise, People v. O.J. Simpson) as a younger version of the diabolical Nurse Ratched from One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest.  Netflix  Netflix has emerged as the streaming home of Murphy by snagging both of his series to hit the premium space in the past five months. The latest development is sure to further fuel speculation about the future of Murphy, one of the top creator-producers working in television today who has pulled off the rare feat of launching commercial and award-winning hits on both broadcast and cable. Netflix has been widely rumored to be among a slew of suitors for Murphy, whose current deal with 20th Century Fox TV expires later this year.  “I haven’t made a decision of where I’m going to go, I’m going to sit back and wait,” Murphy said at TCA last month when asked whether he would stay at the studio, which is in the process of being acquired by Disney.

Holliday said in a statement Saturday that she apologized for her lapse of judgment, for being uneducated on the issues and causing heartbreak for her fans.  Several prominent entertainers have declined to perform at Trump inaugural festivities. Country star Toby Keith and actor Jon Voigt are in the lineup for Thursday's concert.  Holliday's reversal was first reported by The Wrap; the publication obtained a letter Holliday wrote to her fans. Her representative, Bill Carpenter, confirmed the details in the letter to The Associated Press.  ""My only choice must now be to stand with the LGBT Community and to state unequivocally that I WILL NOT PERFORM FOR THE WELCOME CONCERT OR FOR ANY OF THE INAUGURATION FESTIVITIES!"" she wrote.  ""Please know that I HEAR YOU and I feel your pain. The LGBT Community was mostly responsible for birthing my career and I am deeply indebted to you,"" she added. ""You have loved me faithfully and unconditionally and for so many years you provided me with work even though my star had long since faded.""  Related: Toby Keith, 3 Doors Down to Play Inauguration-Related Event  In an interview with The Associated Press on Friday, Holliday defended her decision to perform at the inauguration.  ""I didn't see it as singing for Trump; I saw it as singing for the people on the mall,"" Holliday told the AP.  The performer, who most recently starred on Broadway in ""The Color Purple,"" said she was hurt by the angry backlash, which included calls to boycott her music. Others called her ""Uncle Tom"" and there was even a suggestion that she take her own life.  ""It just really made my heart drop to my feet,"" Holliday said. ""How could I have this much hate spewing at me, and I haven't even done anything? I guess it's not like those old days when political views were your own and you had freedom of speech. ... We live in a different time now, and a decision to go and do something for America is not so clear-cut anymore.""  Holliday was to perform at the ""Make America Great Again! Welcome Celebration"" which included Keith, Voight, and Trump himself.  The celebrity wattage for Trump's inaugural festivities doesn't rival that of Barack Obama's inaugurations, which attracted top names including Beyonce, Bruce Springsteen, U2, Alicia Keys, Kelly Clarkson, Eva Longoria and Jennifer Hudson, among others. But Trump has insisted that's how he wants it, saying the swearing-in festivities should be about the people, not the A-list stars.",1,en,"Broadway star Jennifer Holliday has backed out as a performer at next week's presidential inaugural, saying she did not realize that her participation would be interpreted as a statement of support for President-elect Donald Trump.","Broadway Star Jennifer Holliday Withdraws from Inauguration Performance Amid Political Controversy 

In an unforeseen turn of events, renowned Broadway performer Jennifer Holliday has made a stunning decision to withdraw from her scheduled performance at next week's presidential inaugural ceremony. Holliday, known for her powerful voice and remarkable talent, expressed deep concerns after realizing that her participation might inadvertently convey support for President-elect Donald Trump.

Jennifer Holliday, celebrated for her starring roles in musicals such as ""Dreamgirls"" and ""The Color Purple,"" was previously scheduled to grace the stage during the upcoming inauguration celebration. However, in an open-hearted statement released yesterday, the accomplished artist conceded that she had never anticipated the political implications surrounding her performance.

In recent weeks, numerous voices within the entertainment industry have voiced similar concerns regarding the highly controversial transition of power to the Trump administration. Holliday's unexpected withdrawal is now joined by a growing wave of hesitant performers who fear their appearances might be interpreted as political endorsements.

Acknowledging her honest oversight, Jennifer Holliday expressed remorse for the potential interpretation her involvement might carry. ""It was a lapse in judgment on my part,"" confided Holliday. ""My intention was solely to share my artistic talents and unite the American people through the beauty of music. I did not anticipate the possible implications of my performance, which would have been unrelated to any political ideology.""

While the celebrated artist holds steadfast to her belief that art transcends politics, she acknowledges the current divisive climate and expresses empathy toward those who might interpret her participation differently. Holliday's withdrawal serves as a powerful reminder of the critical role that artists play in society, and the importance of careful consideration in politically charged situations.

Jennifer Holliday's decision to step back from the inaugural performance has sparked a profound discussion within the arts community, underscoring the tensions felt by many artists who navigate the thin line between their craft and the political landscape. Some laud the star's decision as a courageous act of personal integrity, while others maintain that an artist's duty lies in transcending partisan boundaries.

While the controversy surrounding the presidential inauguration ceremony continues to unfold, the spotlight now shifts to President-elect Donald Trump's team, who faces increasing pressure to secure alternative performers for the event. Though several high-profile entertainers have declined invitations to participate, the coming days may reveal new additions to the inauguration lineup, reflecting the diversity and magnitude of talent housed within the United States.

As the world anxiously awaits the official transfer of power, the withdrawal of Jennifer Holliday from the upcoming presidential inaugural performance emphasizes the profound impact the political discourse holds on the world of art. Her actions serve as a sobering reminder that artists, like any public figures, constantly face the scrutiny and challenge of balancing personal beliefs with their duty to deliver the transformative power of their craft to the world."

gossipcop-2194660040,"First Lady Melania Trump claims there is a secret poisoner in the White House and fears her husband is being slowly poisoned with “heavy sedatives” smuggled into his drinks in an attempt to slow him down, control him, and discredit his presidency, according to reports.  While public debate rages about Donald Trump’s health, Melania has told friends and associates that the once robust and high energy man she knew and loved has been replaced with a “slower, damaged version”.  “By 8pm he is slurring,” she said. “This is not the man I know.”  Fearing that the sedatives are being pumped into the body of the POTUS via Coca-Cola that he orders by pressing a button he had installed on the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, Melania has insisted he stop drinking from the tap and instead revert to drinking from cans she brings herself.  “Donald’s heath improved out of sight when he stopped drinking from the tap,” Melania said.  However the First Lady fears the active campaign to poison the president is “a high level operation” and “not the work of a solitary loon.”  Melania is popular in the White House—as she is with the rest of the country—and she has befriended senior intelligence agency staff who remain loyal to president. They have educated her about Ronald Regan’s poisoning by the Deep State after his assassination attempt in 1981. They have also warned her that George W. Bush was reduced to a “brain damaged” state after years of steady poisoning.  But the advantage Trump may hold over his GOP predecessors in the Oval Office is that he has a wife who is wise to the ruse and is insisting he watch his food and drink intake closely for signs of adulteration.  Donald Trump’s food choices say a lot about the man. The president’s Howard Hughes-level pickiness when it comes to food is partly motivated by a desire to avoid being poisoned, according to Melania. He doesn’t trust those around him – and rightfully so.  As President Trump knows all too well, there are enemies of the state dug in deep at the White House.  Reporters from TIME recently got a glimpse behind-the-scenes at the White House, where they reported on what goes down at the president’s dinner table. Of particular interest was a meal enjoyed by the reporters, Trump, and Vice President Pence.  Pence’s meal was not unusual—he ate what everyone else did. But the POTUS received a meal fully customized to his own preferences, and closely observed by Melania who insisted on watching the chef prepare the meal with ingredients she provided herself.",1,en,"First Lady Melania Trump claims there is a secret poisoner in the White House and fears her husband is being slowly poisoned with “heavy sedatives” smuggled into his drinks in an attempt to slow him down, control him, and discredit his presidency, according to reports.","Title: First Lady Melania Trump Exposes Concerns of Possible Intrigue Within the White House

Date: [Insert Date]

In a startling revelation that has sent shockwaves throughout Washington D.C., First Lady Melania Trump has raised concerns regarding the presence of a secretive poisoner within the confines of the White House. Disturbed by her discoveries, Mrs. Trump claims to fear for her husband's well-being, suspecting that he is being subjected to a sinister plot involving the surreptitious introduction of potent tranquilizers into his beverages. Confidential sources have suggested that this could be an attempt to undermine his capabilities, yielding consequences that could ultimately tarnish his presidency.

According to several reports circulating among trusted insiders, the First Lady believes that her spouse, President Donald J. Trump, has fallen victim to a disconcerting scheme aimed at depriving him of his usual vigor, thus impeding his ability to govern effectively. Sources close to the matter indicate that Mrs. Trump has reached out to those she trusts, seeking guidance and assistance in investigating these grave allegations.

Though it is understood that Mrs. Trump possesses limited concrete evidence regarding the alleged poisoner, her deep concerns and the potential ramifications for the nation have encouraged her to take a stand against the perceived malevolence threatening her husband's health and reputation. The First Lady's bravery in coming forward could not only unveil a a possible clandestine operation operating within the highest echelons of the US government but also shed light on the potential consequences of such a nefarious plot.

The authenticity of the First Lady's claims, which have yet to be verified, has ignited widespread speculation within the political sphere. While some have dismissed these allegations as baseless and unsubstantiated, others argue that they warrant a thorough investigation to ensure the security and integrity of the nation's highest office.

White House officials have refrained from commenting publicly on the matter, emphasizing the importance of confidentiality and discretion when addressing issues that could impact the President's safety. Sources from within the administration, who spoke on condition of anonymity, revealed that appropriate measures are being taken by the relevant authorities to assess the validity of the First Lady's fears. Nonetheless, it is understood that the weight of these allegations places an immense responsibility on those tasked with uncovering the truth.

The American public, already wrestling with a multitude of complex issues, now finds itself yet again confronted with a disquieting plot, one that, if proven true, would further undermine trust in the already turbulent political landscape. Questions surrounding the safety of President Trump, the transparency of his administration, and the stability of the nation demand swift and comprehensive action on the part of concerned officials.

As the nation collectively holds its breath awaiting further revelations, the importance of due process and a thorough investigation cannot be overstated. The gravity of this situation calls for a united front in the pursuit of truth, ensuring any suspects in this potentially life-threatening plot are swiftly brought to justice, and the sanctity of the Oval Office is preserved.

In the coming days, it is expected that more light will be shed on the veracity of the First Lady's claims. Until then, the shadows of doubt will loom over the White House, leaving Americans anxious as they wait for answers, hoping for clarity in this unnerving saga that threatens to unravel one of the world's most powerful political institutions."

The action star has steadily starred in film after film, yet has been at the center of several dating rumors.  As the International Business Times reports, “The actor was mistakenly linked to an Australian journalist and then was associated to his Mission: Impossible 6 co-star and Crown actress Vanessa Kirby.”  All rumors until now have been stamped out as false.

A source told the publication about Cruise’s tactics to keep his love life out of the spotlight.  “Tom’s back on the dating scene, but nobody knows it’s him. His face is way too recognizable for him to stroll into the bars, so he has his makeup artist create a silicone mask. Seems like Tom took his Mission: Impossible role to heart. It’s just what Ethan Hunt would do in the movies.”  It’s also been claimed that the disguise, which includes makeup, takes a full five hours to apply. If this rumor all sounds a little far-fetched, that’s because it is completely untrue, according to Gossip Cop. Tom Cruise does not go through some elaborate process to secretly step out on dates.

She had first met Weinstein while making the movie Cider House Rules when she was 14. De la Huerta had communicated with the producer over the years after their first meeting. At around age 21, she said, Weinstein sent her some science-fiction books and suggested she might be right for a role in one of his projects.

This revelation has ignited a flurry of curiosity, raising pertinent questions regarding the couple's relationship status and leaving fans eager for answers.

This silence has left fans and industry insiders yearning for more information, as they eagerly await an official statement from either Pattinson or FKA twigs themselves.

Onwards, her career experienced a significant advancement, especially after she managed to obtain a supporting role in ""Gossip"" and ""Dr T and the Women"" which both came up in 2000. While her accolade-worthy performance in Cameron Crowe's Almost Famous indicated that she was set to follow her mother in taking the film industry by storm. In the midst of a whirlwind schedule of fashion shoots and awards shows, she made an appearance in the romantic war drama The Four Feathers in 2002. Turning out to be a box-office failure, Hudson fired back with the surefire hit as she starred opposite quirky heartthrob Matthew McConaughey in the romantic comedy How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003). She continued to establish herself as a fully-fledged actress starring in subsequent productions like Raising Helen (2004), The Skeleton Key (2005), You, Me and Dupree (2006), Fool's Gold (2008) and Bride Wars (2009).

Last week, Shelton caused an uproar when he sent a cryptic tweet about ""karma"" just as reports claimed that his ex-wife Miranda Lambert was dating a married man.  ""Been taking the high road for a long time.. I almost gave up. But I can finally see something on the horizon up there!! Wait!! Could it be?! Yep!! It’s karma!!"" Shelton tweeted after multiple outlets reported Lambert began dating married Turnpike Troubadours front man, Evan Felker.  But according to Lambert's ex-boyfriend Jeff Allen, Shelton is not as innocent as he's trying to seem.  Allen tweeted and deleted a post calling out Shelton for romancing Allen's then-girlfriend Lambert while Shelton was still married to his first wife, Kaynette Williams, in 2006.  ""You know, I’ve always given you the benefit of the doubt and chalked it up to just being human, but you must be one arrogant SOB to pop off something like this, when I know damn good and well you were cheating on your wife and Miranda was cheating on me when you two started up,"" Allen wrote in a since-deleted tweet, according to Us Weekly.  ""I kept my mouth shut for 13 years. Sorry, his karma tweet rubbed me wrong. All of this is pointless,"" he added.  Allen told RadarOnline.com, ""I’m sure Miranda did [Blake] dirty just like she did me, but he wasn’t thinking about me when he was cheating with her, so I don’t know why he thinks it's karma.""  He added that he does not harbor bad feelings toward Lambert and said she ""was a loving, caring person and a good girlfriend.""  Reps for Lambert and Shelton did not return Fox News' requests for comment.  It's been reported that Lambert and Shelton's romance began as an affair but both singers have denied this in the past. They became engaged in May 2010 and married a year later in Texas. The country singers announced their divorce after four years of marriage in July 2015.  The ""Tin Man"" singer, who recently ended things with her boyfriend of two years, Anderson East, reportedly began seeing Felker when his band joined Lambert's ""Livin’ Like Hippies"" tour in January.  Felker married global strategist Staci Nelson in September 2016. The singer filed for divorce on Feb. 16 while Nelson filed 12 days later.  Nelson, who still goes by her married name on social media, shared a tearful selfie on Thursday with the caption, ""PSA: If Staci Felker can make it through this week, so can you.""",1,en,"It seems Blake Shelton may have a thing or two to learn about karma himself. Last week, Shelton caused an uproar when he sent a cryptic tweet about ""karma"" just as reports claimed that his ex-wife Miranda Lambert was dating a married man.","Title: Blake Shelton's Controversial Tweet Sparks Speculation Surrounding Miranda Lambert's Personal Life

In a surprising turn of events, renowned country music artist Blake Shelton recently found himself at the center of a social media storm amid rumors concerning his ex-wife Miranda Lambert's love life. The tweet, which invoked the notion of karma, set off a flurry of speculation and heated debate within the online community.

Last week, as reports began circulating about Lambert's alleged romance with a man still bound by the vows of matrimony, Shelton took to Twitter to share a cryptic message that many believed was directed towards his former spouse. In doing so, he not only reignited the public's fascination with their highly-publicized divorce but also reignited interest in his own attitude toward karma.

The mysterious tweet read, ""It seems that karma may have a thing or two to teach certain individuals,"" a statement that quickly drew attention and sparked discussion among fans and critics alike. The timing of Shelton's tweet, coinciding with the revelations regarding Lambert's reported relationship, caused the rumor mill to churn even more aggressively.

This triggered an unexpected uproar across social media platforms, with passionate factions emerging to support or scrutinize both Shelton and Lambert. Supporters of the Oklahoma-born singer effusively praised his perceived allusion to the universal concept of karma, suggesting that it must be coming back to bite those who may have wronged him in the past.

However, critics were quick to point out that Shelton may need to examine his own understanding of karma, highlighting that he himself had embarked on a new romantic journey following his divorce from Lambert. They questioned whether his tweet reflected an attempt to pass judgment or merely offered a thought-provoking reflection on karma's unpredictability.

Meanwhile, speculation surrounding Lambert's personal life continued unabated. While some scrutinized the morality of her alleged involvement with a married man, others empathized with the complexities of relationships, acknowledging that the truth might not be so easily defined from the outside.

As the news reverberated throughout country music circles, the debate over morality, relationships, and the true meaning of karma gained momentum. Expert commentators provided insights on how difficult it can be to untangle the intricate threads of human emotions and the inherent challenges faced when navigating life within the public eye.

While Blake Shelton remains mum on the true intentions behind his enigmatic tweet, the incident has once again thrust him and Miranda Lambert into the media's spotlight. For now, the public eagerly awaits further developments, curious to witness the resolution of both their individual journeys and the potential intersection of their lives in this ever-evolving story."

Though she has commented on it via Twitter in the past, as it turns out, why Bekah M. was reported missing is a totally relatable story.

Apparently, Gwen was jealous over his closeness with The Voice winner Chloe Kohanski, and Blake got sick of trying to make her trust him. “She told him she didn’t want to spend her life in fear of her famous partner cheating on her.""  “Blake told Gwen that he was going to be doing the latter part of the monthlong Country Freaks Tour without her,” said the source. “Gwen was so used to accompanying him on tour, she was upended. After their nastiest argument ever, Blake took off without even saying goodbye. It was a real breaking point in the relationship.” Watch the video below to look back at the couple in happier times.  Even worse, Blake has been looking for solace with newly-single ex-wife Miranda Lambert! “Miranda reached out to Blake via text,” said the insider. “Ultimately, they buried the hatchet and have been supporting each other through their latest troubled relationships. They’ve become close friends and allies over the past month or so. They have developed into close confidantes and are sharing intimate details of their lives.” We can only imagine how Gwen would feel about that.

Unveiling an unfortunate tale of love turned sour, Blake Shelton, the charismatic country singer, called it quits with his girlfriend of two years, Gwen Stefani. Unbeknownst to fans until now, this abrupt and seemingly cold-hearted abandonment occurred just before the singer embarked on his highly anticipated tour in February.

The revelation comes exclusively from a reliable source at In Touch, who confidentially informed us of this disheartening development. The news undoubtedly carries a sense of melancholy, as fans had been captivated by the electric chemistry between the former No Doubt frontwoman and the country music icon.

We cannot help but empathize with the pain she must be experiencing, having invested two precious years into this once-enviable partnership. The world had come to admire their mutual support and shared passion for music, and it is truly disheartening to witness the dissolution of such a promising bond.

While the specific reasons behind the couple's separation remain undisclosed, it is undeniable that the timing of Shelton's decision has added fuel to the already raging fire of heartbreak. One can only speculate about the toll this unexpected breakup has taken on Stefani, who must now confront the challenges of redefining her personal and professional life without the presence of Shelton by her side.

Their ability to blend musical genres highlighted their creative synergy, making them an unrivaled entity in the realm of contemporary music.

Thus, with heavy hearts, we bid adieu to what once was, acknowledging the significant impact that Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani's relationship has left on the annals of musical history. Though their love may have faltered, their path forward will be paved with new adventures, stimulating creativity, and the unwavering support of their devoted fan base.

As for the pair’s friends, they reportedly think that these two would work really well together. “All of their mutual friends think Rob and Sienna would be a good match,” the insider said. Rob and Sienna have always seemed pretty close. While promoting their film, The Lost City Of Z at the Berlin International Film Festival in Feb. 2017, the pair looked comfortable together while posing for photos and grabbing dinner together.  This would definitely be an interesting match though considering Sienna is the one who set the Twilight star up with his ex-fiancée FKA twigs. A source told E!

In recent weeks, the spotlight has once again fallen on Hollywood's a-list celebrities, Robert Pattinson and Sienna Miller, as rumors circulate regarding a potential romantic connection between the two. The speculative claims come amidst reports suggesting that both actors, who have recently found themselves unattached, may now have an opportunity to explore an enchanting new chapter in their lives.

Should a romantic relationship blossom between the two celebrated actors, it could certainly have far-reaching consequences for both their personal lives and their professional careers.

gossipcop-7885025406,"More than a month has passed since Matt Lauer was fired from the Today show, and his former longtime colleague, Katie Couric, is now opening up about the former NBC anchor’s shocking dismissal.  “The whole thing has been very painful for me,” Couric, 61, tells PEOPLE. “The accounts I’ve read and heard have been disturbing, distressing and disorienting and it’s completely unacceptable that any woman at the Today show experienced this kind of treatment.  “I had no idea this was going on during my tenure or after I left,” she continued. “I think I speak for many of my former colleagues when I say this was not the Matt we knew. Matt was a kind and generous colleague who treated me with respect. In fact, a joke I once made on late-night television was just that, because it was completely contrary to our brother-sister relationship. It’s still very upsetting. I really admire the way Savannah [Guthrie] and Hoda [Kotb] and the entire Today show staff have handled a very difficult situation.”  The late-night show joke that Couric refers to is when she said on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen in 2012 that Lauer “pinches me on the ass a lot.” A clip of the comment made the rounds online in the wake of Lauer’s firing.  Couric spent 15 years co-hosting NBC’s Today show with Lauer, 60, but left in May 2006 to anchor the CBS Evening News.  NBC/Getty  Lauer was fired at the end of November by NBC News after the network received a “detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior,” with reason to believe “this may not have been an isolated incident.” Women have also anonymously accused him of sexual harassment and assault in reports published by Variety and The New York Times.  Following his firing, which was announced live on Today by Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb, Lauer addressed the original allegations in a statement.  “There are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions,” he said, in part. “To the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry. As I am writing this, I realize the depth of the damage and disappointment I have left behind at home and at NBC.”  Although her PEOPLE interview is the first time Couric has spoken in detail about Lauer’s exit, she briefly broke her silence about the scandal on social media in December.  In a short response to an Instagram user, who called Couric out for not publicly addressing the scandal, the veteran journalist said, “It’s incredibly upsetting and I will say something when I’m ready to. Thanks for your interest.”  RELATED VIDEO: Women of Hollywood Attend Golden Globes Together in Support of the Time’s Up Movement  The claims against Lauer came as hundreds of women and men — including Rose McGowan, Ashley Judd, Terry Crews and Anthony Rapp — have publicly came forward about alleged sexual misconduct at the hands of powerful men in Hollywood, including Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey.  The movement inspired the new Time’s Up initiative and legal defense fund that was created to help victims of sexual misconduct pursue legal action against their perpetrators. Time’s Up was a major focus at this year’s Golden Globes, where almost all the famous attendees wore black to raise awareness about the cause.  “I think it was really moving to see so many women support each other and demand change, not only for themselves, but for mistreated and marginalized women in all kinds of industries,” Couric tells PEOPLE about Time’s Up. “Clearly we are witnessing a sea change and a long overdue course correction.”  She also said that one of the new of the episodes of her upcoming six-part documentary Nat Geo series will focus on harassment women have experienced in their workplaces.  “One of my Nat Geo episodes explores the various obstacles that are holding women back in Hollywood, Silicon Valley and beyond,” she says. “I just interviewed Elisabeth Moss about this. Harassment is just one part of the equation.”  RELATED VIDEO: Hoda Kotb and ",1,en,"More than a month has passed since Matt Lauer was fired from the Today show, and his former longtime colleague, Katie Couric, is now opening up about the former NBC anchor’s shocking dismissal.","More than a month has passed since Matt Lauer was fired from the Today show, and his former longtime colleague, Katie Couric, is now opening up about the former NBC anchor's shocking dismissal.

In a recent interview, Couric, renowned television journalist and co-host, expressed her thoughts on Lauer's abrupt departure and shared her reactions to the revelations that ultimately led to his termination. Maintaining a level of professionalism, Couric chose her words carefully, shedding light on a situation that sent shockwaves through the broadcasting industry.

The termination of Matt Lauer on November 29, 2017, and the subsequent allegations of sexual misconduct that emerged against him, sparked a nationwide conversation on workplace safety and accountability. As an integral part of the Today show team for several years, Couric's connection and friendship with Lauer provided her unique perspectives on the incident that has left millions bewildered.

Couric acknowledged the difficulty of grappling with the revelations, emphasizing her personal struggle to reconcile the actions of someone she had known and worked alongside for so long. She conveyed her profound disbelief and disappointment regarding the alleged misconduct, all while attempting to come to terms with the fact that such behavior could go unnoticed by those closest to him.

The veteran anchor went on to stress the importance of supporting the victims and creating an environment where individuals feel safe and comfortable speaking up about any incidents of harassment or abuse. Couric reaffirmed her belief in the necessity of ongoing conversations surrounding these issues, urging that they should not fade into obscurity as time passes.

Couric's words come at a crucial moment in our society, as individuals across various industries continue to navigate a climate of change and heightened awareness in regards to workplace misconduct. Her balanced and measured response demonstrates the need for both empathy towards survivors, as well as a firm insistence on accountability.

As the court of public opinion remains divided, Katie Couric's interview provides a valuable and measured insight into the complex emotions surrounding Matt Lauer's dismissal. It serves as a stern reminder that even figures with a prominent public persona can have deeply hidden flaws, while emphasizing the importance of upholding standards of respect and dignity in professional environments.

The road to recovery for both NBC and the Today show will undoubtedly be a lengthy one, with this incident leaving an indelible mark on the broadcast network's history. However, it is through courageous conversations and a collective commitment to change that we can hope for a brighter, more inclusive future for all professionals, free from the shadow of harassment and misconduct."

gossipcop-500443225,"Three years after announcing their separation and more than a year after filing for divorce, Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner are still legally married — and they may be that way for a while if they don’t act fast.  LA County Superior Court advised the couple that their divorce case may be delayed because they have yet to file and enter the final judgment, a document obtained by The Blast revealed.  “If you fail to take the appropriate steps in your case, the court may dismiss your case for delay in prosecution,” the document states.  It’s unclear what the holdup is.  Garner, 46, and Affleck, 45, were married for nearly 10 years before separating in 2015. Last year, following reports that Garner had called off their divorce, Affleck finally moved out of the property the couple shared.  Shortly after, it was revealed that Affleck had moved on with “Saturday Night Live” producer Lindsay Shookus in July 2017.  The exes have an amicable relationship and are focused on co-parenting their daughters, Violet, 12, and Seraphina, 9, and son Samuel, 6.  “We are definitely a modern family. We’re doing really well,” Garner said previously. “It has to be [children first]. You have no choice. It has to be.”  Reps for Garner and Affleck did not immediately return requests for comment.

Despite these significant milestones, it has come to light that the former pair remains bound by the legal bonds of matrimony, their marriage status indefinitely intact. However, time is now of the essence for both individuals, as their failure to expedite their divorce proceedings threatens to extend their union indefinitely.

The captivating charm of both Affleck and Garner has captivated audiences around the world, creating a whirlwind romance emblematic of the Hollywood dream. Yet in June 2015, they publicly announced their separation, acknowledging the many complexities of their relationship. A year later, the couple officially filed for divorce, embarking on what should have been the final journey towards legal disentanglement. However, peculiar circumstances and unforeseen delays have encumbered their once inevitable divorce.

While the reasons behind the prolonged dissolution of their marriage remain undisclosed, speculation abounds regarding the potential issues they continue to grapple with. These complications embroil not only their personal lives but also the legal realm, as their inaction perpetuates the legal obligations of their marriage.

As time trickles steadily forward, legal experts now advocate for swift action on behalf of the estranged couple. Failure to do so will inevitably subject the pair to a prolonged period of remaining bound together, unable to claim legal independence from one another. This prospect casts a shadow of uncertainty over both Affleck and Garner, who have individually pursued new chapters in their lives since the announcement of their separation.

It is imperative for Affleck and Garner to realize the urgency of their situation, prioritizing the resolution of their divorce. Their dedication to their family, namely their three children, has been widely acknowledged, but allowing their divorce to languish indefinitely would undoubtedly undermine their collective well-being. In order to provide a stable and nurturing environment for their children, it is incumbent upon the former couple to expeditiously finalize their legal separation.

Furthermore, the protraction of their divorce proceedings underscores the longstanding issue of legal backlogs within the family court system. The plight of Affleck and Garner brings to light the arduous journey that many couples embarking on divorce face, and the potential repercussions of bureaucratic inefficiency. This case serves as a clarion call for legislative and judicial bodies to reassess and address these prevalent challenges.

As the announcement of Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner's separation resonated throughout Hollywood, fueling conjecture and speculation, their journey towards legally defined independence continues to remain uncertain. The onus falls upon this once-celebrated couple, who captured public fascination with their love story, to act promptly and decisively. Their quest for closure echoes a resounding message, reminding us all of the importance of bringing finality to that which has run its course, thereby allowing for new beginnings and personal growth."

In a recent development, tennis superstar Serena Williams has strongly rebutted controversial claims made by John McEnroe, the arguably legendary male tennis player, regarding her hypothetical performance on the men's circuit. Williams, who holds an unprecedented record of 23 Grand Slam singles titles, voiced her disagreement over McEnroe's statements, categorically refuting any doubts surrounding her ability to compete at the highest level of men's tennis.

McEnroe's comments, made during an interview on a popular television show, ignited a fervent debate within the tennis community. The Hall of Famer and former world number one argued that if Williams were competing against men, she would find it difficult to break into the top 700. However, Williams, undoubtedly one of the greatest athletes of our time, has responded with unwavering determination, asserting her confidence and maintaining her belief that she would emerge victorious against even the toughest male competition.

In a recent press conference following McEnroe's remarks, Serena Williams expressed her disappointment and surprise at his assertions. She firmly stated, ""I would hope that I would win against Serena"", dismissing McEnroe's hypothetical claim as purely speculative. Williams, known for her resilience and mental fortitude, further emphasized that she has always been fueled by challenges, and the suggestion that she would struggle against male opponents only fuels her drive to prove the naysayers wrong.

With a career marked by unparalleled success, Williams has shattered numerous records and changed the face of women's tennis forever. Her unwavering dedication, extraordinary skill, and immense physical prowess have been instrumental in establishing her dominance in the sport. Not only does Williams boast an astonishing 23 Grand Slam titles, but she has also proven her mettle against past and current tennis greats.

Exemplifying her undeniable prowess, Williams has defeated several male tennis players during exhibition matches over the years. These victories have served as compelling evidence of her ability to compete at the highest level of professional tennis, irrespective of her opponents' gender. Arguably, such triumphs have demonstrated the significance of Williams' contributions in transcending the limits of gender in the realm of sports.

Williams' crusade for gender equality in tennis has not only inspired countless aspiring female athletes but has also ensured that her legacy will be immortalized in the annals of sporting history. Over the years, she has confronted arduous challenges, both on and off the court, with an unwavering spirit and an unwritten determination to overcome any odds stacked against her.

As the tennis world continues to grapple with the controversy ignited by John McEnroe's comments, Serena Williams' swift and vehement response sends a resounding message. It underscores her resolute belief in her abilities, reinforcing the notion that gender need not be a restrictive factor in determining athletic prowess.

While it is true that Serena Williams would face a unique set of challenges on the men's circuit, to discredit her capability is to undermine her monumental achievements and her enduring legacy. As a beacon of inspiration to aspiring athletes worldwide, Williams has unassailably cemented her place among the greatest tennis players of all time."

The witnesses told investigators the brothers split the money and that Cedric Poore took the jewelry to pawn.    When he was interviewed Wednesday, James Poore confirmed to investigators that he knew one of the victims and that he was in the apartment where the witnesses placed him. Before invoking his right to remain silent, he told investigators he knew one of the victims had used and sold illegal drugs and that Cedric drove a black van to the apartment the day of the murders.    The arrest report shows Cedric Poore denied being in the apartment the day of the murders and refused to speak to investigators any more.  Chief Jordan said the brothers both stayed at Fairmont Terrace Apartments. The property manager there told News On 6 that neither of them are on a lease.  Cedric Poore has been in Tulsa County jail on a traffic violation since January 14, and James Poore was arrested Wednesday morning. Department of Corrections records show both James and Cedric have been previously convicted and incarcerated for robbery with a firearm.  Chief Jordan said more arrests may still be made.  Mayor Dewey Bartlett released a statement Wednesday afternoon, in response to the news of the arrests:    ""The Tulsa Police Department is known for their quick efforts of finding perpetrators and they indeed lived up to their stellar reputation for this case. I have the utmost confidence in Chief Chuck Jordan and the Tulsa Police Department and I knew they would bring in those involved with this hideous quadruple murder in very short order. Although a direct tip from the public cannot be identified as the catalyst that led to the arrests, tips are always important, which is part of great police work from our force.""",1,en,"Two arrests have been made in the murders of four women at Fairmont Terrace Apartments last month, police announced Wednesday afternoon.","Two arrests have been made in the murders of four women at Fairmont Terrace Apartments last month, police announced Wednesday afternoon.

However, Joshua doesn't share Jared's political views.  ""It is no secret that liberal values have guided my life and that I have supported political leaders that share similar values,"" the 33-year-old revealed in a 2017 Forbes interview. ""But neither political party has a monopoly on the truth or on constructive ideas for our country. It's important to be open minded and learn from differing opinions.""  Forbes also reported that the Democrat did not vote for Trump in the 2016 election. According to The Daily Mail, ""Josh and Jared’s parents were Democratic donors until 2016.""  It seems as though Joshua shares his wife's political views—Kloss was vocal about voting for Hillary Clinton. She regularly gets involved in political campaigns, with Joshua supporting her at political marches including March for Our Lives in 2018.  2. He's been dating Kloss since 2012.  According to Bustle, Kloss and Kushner first met in June 8, 2012, with the model revealing on the same date in 2016, ""Four years ago today I met my best friend. I love you more everyday.""  Rumors about their relationship initially started when Kushner attended a Victoria's Secret Fashion Show afterparty in November 2012, with Us Weekly reporting via a source that, ""They are really cute together.

For the past decade, the reality television series Keeping Up With The Kardashians has captured the attention of audiences worldwide. Often met with skepticism due to preconceived notions about its content, the show has managed to surprise and move viewers through its profoundly emotional storylines. While the Kardashian name has become synonymous with luxury, social media, and modern slang, delving beyond these veneers reveals an array of touching and compelling narratives.

Contrary to popular belief, Keeping Up With The Kardashians encompasses far more than just countless hours of staring into iPhone screens, indulging in daily delivered box salads, and the occasional overuse of the phrase 'like, seriously.' Behind the glitz and glamour lies an earnest portrayal of human emotions, highlighting the complexities of family and personal struggles in a refreshingly raw manner.

Throughout its ten-year run, the Keeping Up With The Kardashians franchise has ventured deep into the lives of its famous family. While they may appear to be living extraordinary lives of opulence, the reality is far from perfect. The show's creators have not shied away from delving into the personal tribulations faced by its cast, making for genuinely stirring and heart-wrenching television.

From the very beginning, the Kardashian-Jenner clan laid bare the challenges they faced, illustrating a level of vulnerability that resonated with viewers. Each sibling navigated their own unique trials and tribulations, providing a compassionate and empathetic look into the rollercoaster of emotions experienced within a tightly knit family.

The series has fearlessly tackled sensitive topics, shedding light on issues many can relate to. From divorce and relationship struggles to the immense pressures of fame and public scrutiny, Keeping Up With The Kardashians has curated a platform for open discussions and soul-searching. By sharing their deep-seated vulnerabilities, the family has inadvertently fostered a sense of connection and solidarity among viewers.

At its core, the longevity of the show can be attributed to its ability to capture the human experience authentically. Not everything is presented through rose-colored glasses; instead, the moments of despair and heartache are given equal attention. By embracing vulnerability, the Kardashian-Jenner family has prompted discussions surrounding mental health, self-image, and the importance of emotional well-being.

While Keeping Up With The Kardashians might initially be dismissed as a mere guilty pleasure, the revelation of its genuinely stirring storylines transcends any preconceptions. The show has succeeded in crafting a captivating and thought-provoking narrative that, ultimately, resonates with the human spirit. By focusing on raw emotions rather than superficialities, it has fostered an unexpected kinship between the cast and viewers worldwide.

As the show recently announced its final season, fans and critics alike eagerly await the emotional conclusion of this decade-long journey. Regardless of personal opinions, one cannot deny the profound impact that Keeping Up With The Kardashians has had on popular culture, forever transforming the way we perceive reality television and highlighting the power of authenticity in storytelling."

In this unprecedented political climate, the nation remains divided, and the impending inauguration does not escape the deep polarization that continues to grip the country.

As the fire of political discourse rages on, dissenting voices who refuse to participate in this historic event are growing in numbers. It is important to acknowledge that many citizens, disenchanted with the path President-elect Trump has charted, have made the conscious decision to abstain from witnessing the inauguration ceremony.

The decision by some Americans to forego witnessing this momentous occasion, which has typically served as a symbol of unity and hope for the future, reflects the deep-seated concerns felt by a significant portion of the population. These concerns largely stem from the controversies and various policy stances that have characterized Trump's unconventional campaign and transition.

It is worth noting that this resistance is not solely confined to the general public. Numerous elected officials, both at the federal and state levels, have signaled their intent to skip the inauguration festivities. Many express their refusal as an act of solidarity with constituents who feel marginalized by Trump's rhetoric, policies, or actions. It is evident that controversy continues to follow the president-elect, even as he prepares to take the oath of office.

Nevertheless, the momentous nature of the inauguration cannot be overlooked. With the presidential seal adorning his lectern, Donald Trump will be entrusted with the responsibility of leading the United States through some of its most complex challenges. Millions of Americans, both ardent supporters and skeptical observers, recognize the significance of this day and will be tuned in to witness the transfer of power.

As the clock ticks down to Friday's inauguration, it is important to reflect on the broader implications of this event. This is not merely an inauguration; it signifies the beginning of a new chapter in America's storied history. The world watches with bated breath as the United States, a global superpower, transitions power to the 45th president.

Whether Americans choose to watch or abstain from the inauguration, it is the hope of many that unity, mutual respect, and progress will prevail during Trump's tenure. The challenges facing our divided nation are monumental, but together, through perseverance and dialogue, there is immense potential to build a stronger, more inclusive society.

So, as Donald J. Trump steps onto the grand stage on January 20th to usher in a new era, it is clear that not everyone will be watching. Yet, in the midst of this historic occasion, one can only hope that the United States can find common ground, bridging the vast divides that have plagued our nation, and forge a path forward that benefits all its citizens."

In 2016, Lady Gaga revealed an Instagram post is 2016 that she suffers from ""chronic pain"" but never gave more details. But in her upcoming documentary, ""Gaga: Five Foot Two,"" the singer and actress dives a little deeper into the disease she's been battling for some time.

Because of this pain, a few common symptoms include fatigue, tenderness, sleep disorders, memory problems, depression, and stiffness.  The foundation also reports that 10 million Americans suffer from fibromyalgia with a ratio of eight to two ratio, women over men.  There is no cure for this pain, and it is a lifelong condition.  The disease can occur on its own but has also been linked to stress, repetitive injuries, and other diseases like Lupus, according to the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases. Researchers are working to determine definitively what causes people to develop this pain in the hopes of finding a cure or better treatment options.  Healthline reports that treatment typically goes beyond medication and focuses on improving quality of life through self-care and lifestyle changes. Medication options vary from antidepressants and sleep aids to pain relievers and narcolepsy drugs.  Other celebs have opened up about their struggle with chronic pain or fibromyalgia.

The country superstar opened up about his romance with the No Doubt frontwoman in a new interview with Billboard magazine.  As previously reported, Shelton told Stefani that he was splitting from Lambert during a meeting with their Voice coworkers. The “Misery” singer, who was new to the team at the time, got emotional.  “I won’t forget that day. I looked over at Gwen — who I didn’t really know — and she had these huge tears in her eyes. I thought, ‘Wow, she feels super bad for me!’” Shelton recalled. “She didn’t tell me much, because we didn’t know each other at the time, but she said, ‘I’m going through something very similar to what you’re going through. I understand. And I hate it.’”  Stefani was dealing with her own breakup at the time with Gavin Rossdale. (As Us Weekly exclusively revealed, the Bush rocker was cheating on her with their children’s nanny, Mindy Mann.) They announced they were ending their 13-year marriage in August 2015, one month after Shelton and Lambert announced they were divorcing after four years.  The “Came Here to Forget” singer and Stefani leaned on each other for support during the difficult time. The closer they got, the more Shelton saw Stefani in a new light.  “That’s kind of how our friendship and bond started, that day. It went from that, to checking in on each other once a week through email — ‘This s–t happened to me, what happened to you?’ — to maybe three times a week, then every day, to ‘Hey, here’s my phone number if you ever want to text,’” Shelton told Billboard. “Next thing I know, I wake up and she’s all I care about, and I’m ­wondering if she feels the same about me.”  “Gwen saved my life,” he added. “Who else on earth could understand going through a high-profile divorce from another musician? You can’t even imagine the similarities in our divorces.”  The two teamed up professionally too. Shelton included their collaborative track, “Go Ahead and Break My Heart,” on his 12th studio album, If I’m Honest.  “When we recorded the vocals for some of these songs, I was only six months removed from when all the crap went down,” Shelton said of his split from Lambert. “When you have a broken heart — at least, when I do — you got to get it out of your system. You want people to sympathize with you. I was at rock bottom, in the middle of hell.”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!

In the wake of his high-profile divorce from Miranda Lambert, renowned country artist Blake Shelton found solace and renewed strength in the compassionate arms of pop superstar Gwen Stefani.

As Shelton navigated the complexities of heartbreak, Stefani's empathy and compassion allowed him to confront his pain head-on, ultimately leading to personal growth and healing. Together, they embarked on a shared journey of rediscovering happiness, despite the scars of their pasts.

As their relationship blossomed, so did the musical synergy between the two artists. The profound impact of Stefani's contribution to Shelton's creative process manifested in his critically acclaimed album ""If I'm Honest"" (2016), where deeply introspective tracks like ""Came Here to Forget"" and ""She's Got a Way with Words"" showcased his cathartic journey towards emotional redemption.

Blake Shelton's remarkable transformation over the years serves as a testament to the healing power of love and the profound impact that a supportive partner can have. Today, he stands tall as an artist reborn, ready to face the world with renewed vigor and unshakable determination.

Wintour favored more naturalistic photography of lesser-known models outside, as opposed to the tight headshots the magazine had previously favored. Additionally, Wintour's first Vogue cover was also the first to feature a model wearing jeans, with the added bonus of wearing a bejeweled T-shirt valued at around $10,000.

The case is now closed and the body is ready for pick up,” Ed Winter of the Los Angeles Coroner Office tells Us Weekly on Thursday, February 1.  As previously reported, the coroner confirmed to Us that the Glee alum died on Tuesday, January 30. Salling was found by a riverbed in the Sunland-Tujunga neighborhood of L.A., and was pronounced dead at the scene. Us confirmed that one of Salling’s family members reported him missing at 3 a.m. before his body was discovered on Tuesday.  The 35-year-old actor, who pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography involving a prepubescent minor in December 2017, was set to be sentenced on March 7. In October, he agreed to a plea deal that included four to seven years in jail. According to the court documents previously obtained by Us, Salling was also ordered to pay approximately $50,000 in restitution and register as a sex offender after his stint in jail.  However, a source close to his child pornography case explained to Us on Wednesday, January 31, that Salling’s estate might not have to pay his victims because he was not sentenced before his death.  “Restitution would be a part of his sentence. The amount of the restitution is determined by the sentencing judge … He will not be sentenced. Therefore there will be no restitution order,” the insider told Us. “Therefore I doubt that there is anything to take to civil court. Any restitution order would be allocated among multiple known victims.”  The source added, “I’m not saying that there isn’t some lawyer out there willing to file suit on behalf of someone claiming to be a victim. But I am saying, that there is no order to be enforced, for $50,000 or any other amount on behalf of anyone.”  Criminal defense attorney Troy Slaten, who is not directly involved in Salling’s case, further explained that Salling’s victims would have to file a suit in civil court to pursue any restitution.  “Any victims can sue his estate in civil court and receive monetary awards for damages. These awards … can be in the neighborhood of hundred of thousands of dollars or even in the millions,” Slaten said. They have to file suit in civil court, if they have not already, which they want to do quickly, because you do not want the estate to distribute assets.

In a shocking turn of events, Maksim Chmerkovskiy, renowned professional dancer and beloved former cast member of Dancing with the Stars, recently found himself amid a whirlwind of controversy. His unexpected decision to skip out on the current season of the iconic dancing competition left fans in utter disbelief, resulting in a frenzy of social media uproar against the talented performer.

Unconfirmed rumors began circulating widely that Chmerkovskiy's increasingly strained relationship with his celebrity partner, Vanessa Lachey, was the primary catalyst behind his controversial departure. Allegations of tension and discord backstage heightened curiosity, fueling indignant discussions on popular platforms such as Twitter. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the dance floor’s revered duo continues to endure endless reminders and criticisms on the platform, as Twitter users refuse to let them forget the ordeal.

Chmerkovskiy and Lachey have undeniably captivated audiences in previous seasons with their awe-inspiring performances and undeniable chemistry. But as the dazzling lights dimmed and the sequins settled at the beginning of the latest Dancing with the Stars installment, Chmerkovskiy's unanticipated absence sent shockwaves through the tight-knit community of fans who eagerly follow the show's dramatic twists and turns.

While personal reasons may lie at the crux of Chmerkovskiy's unexpected departure, speculation has run rife ever since announcements were made, firmly pointing accusatory fingers at a troubled partnership with Lachey. This conjecture, fueled further by persistent backstage murmurs and rolling tabloid headlines, has galvanized a passionate conversation on social media, notably Twitter. As the micro-blogging platform continues to be a breeding ground for opinions and fervent discussions, users are relentlessly reminding Chmerkovskiy and Lachey of the strained relationship that allegedly led to his notorious absence.

Twitter, well-known for its ability to amplify public sentiments, has become an arena of sorts for fans to publicly express their feelings towards the dancing duo's unfortunate falling out. In an era where public figures are continuously under scrutiny, armchair critics on the platform have seized the opportunity to voice their disappointment and question both Chmerkovskiy's loyalty and professionalism.

While the authenticity of these reports remains shrouded in uncertainty, the impact is palpable. A swarm of hashtags, trending topics, and viral memes relentlessly remind Chmerkovskiy of the proverbial scarlet letter that is his decision to abandon this season of Dancing with the Stars. Social media has morphed into an unforgiving judge, jury, and executioner, highlighting the fragility and unpredictability of public adoration.

As Dancing with the Stars, now in its illustrious 30th season, continues to captivate millions across the nation, Chmerkovskiy's shocking absence remains a topic of concern and speculation within the dedicated fanbase. For better or worse, Twitter has become a merciless time capsule, immortalizing headlines and perpetuating the narrative of Chmerkovskiy's controversial choice. It is yet to be seen how the performer and his dancing partner, Vanessa Lachey, will ultimately respond or recover from the backlash, but the indomitable force of Twitter's collective voice serves as a stark reminder that the public eye never blinks, especially when it comes to beloved stars on the brink of controversy."

Summary At Winterfell At Winterfell, Arya Stark talks to her sister Sansa Stark about borrowing Bran Stark's bow and arrow. She tells Sansa that she practiced several times until she finally hit the bullseye. Arya recalls that their father Eddard Stark had been watching and clapped his hands in praise of her accomplishments. Arya reasons that their father knew that the rules were wrong but that his daughter was in the right. She then confronts Sansa about her alleged role in their father's death. Arya presents the letter that Sansa had written to their late brother Robb Stark urging him to come and bend the knee to King Joffrey Baratheon. Sansa replies that the Queen Mother Cersei Lannister forced her to do it under duress. Arya counters that she was not tortured and that she saw Sansa at Ned's execution; Sansa retorts that Arya did nothing to stop their father's execution either. Arya chastises Sansa for betraying their family but Sansa responds that they have only returned to Winterfell because of her, while Arya travelled the world in pursuit of her own agenda. Sansa adds that their half-brother Jon Snow was saved from defeat when Petyr Baelish and the Knights of the Vale came to their rescue and insists Arya would not have survived the torments she endured at the hands of Joffrey and Ramsay. Sansa demands to know where Arya found the letter and chides her younger sister that Cersei would be pleased to see them fighting but Arya is still bitter towards Sansa. She realizes that while Jon would understand the difficult circumstances Sansa was under when she wrote the letter, Sansa is afraid the Northern lords will discover it and turn on her, including Lyanna Mormont. Arya adds that Lyanna is younger than Sansa was when she wrote this letter but argues Lyanna wouldn't agree with Sansa's defense that she was a child at the time. While recognizing that Sansa wrote the letter out of fear, a bitter Arya says that she prefers to embrace anger over fear. Later, Sansa asks Petyr Baelish about where Arya got the letter from, unaware that Baelish orchestrated the entire incident. Sansa tells Petyr that she is commanding 20,000 men who answer to Jon but not to her. Petyr tells Sansa that the men will trust her because she can rule. Sansa does not trust the loyalty of the Northern lords, citing their history of switching sides. She counters that the discovery of the letter will turn her liege lords and men against her. Sansa confides in Petyr about her strained relations with Arya. Petyr suggests that Sansa talk to Brienne of Tarth because she has sworn to protect both of Lady Catelyn Stark's daughters from harm's way. Trusting Baelish, Sansa accepts his advice. The following morning, Maester Wolkan informs Sansa that they have received a letter from Queen Cersei. Sansa meets with Brienne, who advises her not to leave Winterfell. Instead, Sansa decides to send Brienne as her representative since she could reason with Jaime Lannister. Brienne warns that it is too dangerous for her to leave Sansa alone at Winterfell with Petyr. Sansa insists that her guards and men are loyal to her but Brienne warns that Petyr might be bribing them behind her back. Brienne offers to leave her squire Podrick Payne, whose swordsmanship has improved, but Sansa insists that she can take care of herself.

Arya catches her sister pilfering through her personal effects. When Sansa tells Arya that her men are loyal to her, Arya mockingly retorts that they are not here. Arya tells Sansa that she obtained the faces from the Faceless Men of Braavos and admits she spent time training to be a Faceless Man. She forces Sansa to play the lying game and begins by asking if she thinks that Jon is the rightful King. Sansa demands that Arya tell her what the ""faces"" are. Arya replies that they always wanted to pretend to be other people. Sansa wanted to be a queen while Arya herself wanted to be a knight. In the end, neither of them got what they wanted. Arya says that the faces allow her to become someone else and toys with the idea of assuming Sansa's face and status. Arya approaches Sansa with her dagger and muses as the possibility of becoming the Lady of Winterfell. However, Arya relents and leaves a disturbed Sansa alone with the dagger. The Wight Hunt At Dragonstone castle, Queen Daenerys Targaryen and her Hand Tyrion Lannister chat in the Chamber of the Painted Table. Daenerys tells Tyrion that she appreciates the fact that he is not a hero because they have a tendency of risking their lives to do dangerous things. She compares Tyrion favorably to ""heroes"" such as Khal Drogo, Ser Jorah Mormont, Daario Naharis and Jon Snow, most of whom ""do stupid things, trying to outdo the others"". Tyrion, slightly amused, notes that all of those individuals fell in love with Daenerys, but she dismisses the obvious implication that Jon Snow is in love with her – to which Tyrion sarcastically quips that Jon must be staring so longingly at her because he is so eager for a military alliance. Daenerys remarks that Jon is too little for her tastes, but immediately apologizes when she realizes she's accidentally insulted Tyrion's height. Daenerys also recognizes that Tyrion is no coward.

In this grand old city, the Grand Old Party of Lincoln, Eisenhower and Reagan starts its quest for the White House, led by a man with Texas roots and a president's name. Now, from Philadelphia's First Union Center, here are CNN's Bernard Shaw, Judy Woodruff, and Jeff Greenfield. SHAW: And welcome to this grand finale night.

CANDY CROWLEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: To say that this is an important night for George Bush understates the case. This is one really of three pivotal moments that in the past have either made or broken a presidential candidate: The selection of a vice president, the convention speech, and the fall debates are considered the three key moments for any campaign. So George Bush has been practicing this speech, has been rewriting this speech for weeks, even more than a month now. What Bush must do is play both to the people in this room; that is, mostly the more conservative members of this party, as well as reach out to those who will, in fact, decide the election, the swing voters. We are told this will be a subtler speech than Secretary Cheney's speech was last night; that, in fact, Bush will outline his agenda. He may take a poke or two at Al Gore about the Internet. But beyond that, what you are going to hear tonight is a direct appeal to the swing voters. George Bush is the key face in the new face of the Republican Party, and that is the face that we will see tonight. And now onto my colleague, Frank Sesno.

It’s been more than two years since Blake Shelton, 40, and Miranda Lambert, 33, ended their marriage, but she’s finally ready to sit down and hash things out, according to a new report. Amidst new rumors that Blake is having trouble in his relationship with Gwen Stefani, 47, an insider tells InTouch that Miranda wants to confront her ex to finally get closure. “It needs to be done,” the source tells the mag. “There’s still a lot of unfinished business between [Miranda] and Blake. She needs to look straight into Blake’s eyes, ask certain questions, and get answers.”  There are no plans set for this meeting to actually take place just yet, but the mag claims that if it does happen, Miranda plans to go in with a “clear head,” although that might not be so easy. “This could get heated,” the insider admits. “As soon as the emotions come up, [Miranda] may lose it.” This doesn’t mean the 33-year-old wants to get back together with her ex, though — actually, it’s just the opposite. She’s very happy with her man, Anderson East, 29, but feels a face-to-face with Blake is what she needs to fully be ready to commit to another relationship, according to the source.  “She feels that [she and Blake] have both grown so much since their divorce that meeting up is essential for them to have healthy relationships in the future,” InTouch’s insider says. “Who knows, maybe this meeting with Blake will have them walk away as friends. Either way, they’ll definitely be in a better place.”  As for the rumored trouble between Blake and Gwen, we’re going to take that report (from OK! magazine) with a grain of salt. After all, they were just spotted looking totally in love on Aug. 20!

On the same day that unconfirmed rumors began to circulate about a possible rift between renowned country crooner Blake Shelton and the enigmatic pop sensation Gwen Stefani, our sources have uncovered a startling report that sheds light on a different perspective altogether.

According to an undisclosed source close to the situation, the Grammy Award-winning songstress Miranda Lambert is purportedly making fervent efforts to reconnect with her former flame.

While the specifics of this supposed encounter remain murky, speculation has erupted regarding Lambert's motivations and the potential consequences of such an emotional reunion. The source hints at the possibility of unresolved feelings that have lingered for far too long, leading to a longing that simply cannot be ignored any further.

Those familiar with the intricacies of the love triangle between Shelton, Stefani, and Lambert will recall the tumultuous events that unfolded in the past. The divorce of the once-adored country music couple, Shelton and Lambert, sent reverberations through the entertainment industry, capturing the attention of fans and critics alike.

In recent weeks, speculations have been rife surrounding the status of Kris Jenner and Corey Gamble's relationship, as the power couple has noticeably refrained from making public appearances together. The high-profile pair, aged 61 and 36 respectively, were last seen side by side on Valentine's Day, though their demeanor left onlookers questioning the authenticity of their affection. As whispers grow louder, we delve into the circumstances surrounding this perceived estrangement.

Known for her influential role as the matriarch of the Kardashian-Jenner clan and his affiliation with the celebrity world, Kris Jenner and Corey Gamble have long captivated the public's attention. Their relationship has often been a focal point, with both supporters and critics closely following their dynamic. However, this adage of ""opposites attract"" seems to be losing its luster, raising concerns about the stability of their bond.

Observers recall that the photogenic duo stepped out together on the romantic occasion of Valentine's Day, but their public outing failed to showcase the love and affection usually associated with couples on this special day. Witnesses noted an unusual coolness between the two, casting doubt on their romantic connection. Since that eventful evening, the couple, once ubiquitous on the Hollywood scene, have appeared to deliberately shy away from public encounters together.

The couple's penchant for discretion may have stoked rumors of a relationship in distress. While maintaining privacy can be a hallmark of healthy partnerships, sudden and extended absences from public view conjure doubts and fuel speculation. Given their prominence and the media scrutiny surrounding them, it is not surprising that rumors of a growing estrangement have sparked a flurry of speculation. But what exactly lies beneath the surface?

One theory posits that the incessant demands of their respective careers have slowly eroded the time and emotional energy available for nurturing their relationship. Kris Jenner, as the mastermind behind the Kardashian-Jenner empire, has consistently juggled multiple commitments, leaving little time for her personal life. Meanwhile, Corey Gamble, known for his connections in the celebrity world, is often required to be at high-profile events, intensifying the distance between him and Jenner.

It is crucial to note that no official confirmation has been made regarding the state of their relationship. Speculation aside, sources close to the couple maintain that their connection may be temporarily strained due to their busy schedules, rather than an irreparable rupture. Only time will reveal the truth behind the couple's dwindling public appearances.

Nevertheless, as public figures, Kris Jenner and Corey Gamble have had their every move scrutinized. Consequently, any unusual behavior will naturally attract widespread attention. The apparent lack of unity observed lately inevitably lends credence to doubts surrounding their relationship's longevity, despite the optimistic outlook shared by some.

While signs of trouble within the relationship have been evident, we must remain cautious and remember not to draw hasty conclusions. Relationships, particularly those played out under the unrelenting gaze of the public eye, often experience their fair share of ups and downs.

gossipcop-4524134287,"No need to rush. Jennifer Lopez is not in a hurry to walk down the aisle with Alex Rodriguez, but she does want to spend the rest of her life with someone.  “I do believe in marriage,” the Shades of Blue actress, 48, told Harper’s Bazaar in a story published on Thursday, March 15. “And I would love to grow old with somebody in a committed relationship. But I’m not forcing anything right now.”  As far as her relationship with the 42-year-old former Yankees player, she said: “It’s good, it’s healthy; we communicate well. We understand each other’s lives in a way that most other people couldn’t.”  She added: “We both entered the public eye in our early twenties and overachieved right from the start. And that affects every dynamic in your life, from your family to your work to your relationships. We have a similar makeup.”  The pair celebrated their anniversary in February in Minneapolis, where the singer performed a concert ahead of the Super Bowl. During the show, she debuted her single “Us” written by Poo Bear and produced by Skrillex, and dedicated it to Rodriguez, who was in the audience. “We’ve been together for one year today. I don’t want to get all mushy or anything, but baby, this song’s for you. I love you,” she told the athlete while on stage.  When talking about how she chose the song, Lopez told the magazine that the lyrics fit right into where the couple were in their relationship. She said: “They played me about 20 different songs, and when I heard this one I was like, ‘Oh, this is relevant!’ Alex and I were just getting to know each other. And I was like, ‘Oh, my God, could this be? Could this be us?’”  Lopez was previously married to chef Ojani Noa for nearly a year in 1997, and dancer Cris Judd from 2001 to 2002. She later married singer Marc Anthony in 2004 and they called it quits in 2011. The pair share 10-year-old twins Max and Emme. The former Yankees shortstop shares daughters Ella, 9, and Natasha, 13, with ex-wife Cynthia Scurtis. They split in 2008 after six years of marriage.  A lot has changed in the “Dance Again” songstress’ life since her last relationship, and she said a lot of it has to do with really knowing herself. “When I was younger I spent a lot of time being half happy and half not happy,” she told the publication. “I know who I am and what I want. I also know my strengths and weaknesses. It took me a long time to get to a point where I could say something nice about myself. I’m glad I can do that now.”  Lopez remains optimistic as she continues with her career, raise her two children and make her relationship with Rodriguez work for the long run. “Baseball is just like life,” she said. “All you want to do is hit a home run.”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!",1,en,"No need to rush.

Radical transformation and permanent growth seem to be the guiding principles Jennifer Lopez internalizes throughout her personal journey. Her decision to eschew societal expectations reflects a profound understanding that a lasting partnership transcends the need to conform to external demands. Consequently, the renowned performer encourages us to ponder the essentiality of building a foundation based on emotional connection, shared values, and profound understanding before embarking on the formal union of marriage.

The National Association of Black Journalists Accuses NBC of ""Whitewashing"" Amidst Tamron Hall's Departure

Subheadline: Allegations of diversity concerns arise as iconic journalist's exit sparks debate within the media landscape 

[City], [Date] - The National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) expressed deep concern and accused the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) of ""whitewashing"" the network's image after the announcement of Tamron Hall's impending departure. As the dust settles around this controversial decision, the NABJ is calling for greater transparency and commitment to diversity in newsrooms across the country.

Tamron Hall, whose captivating presence graced the television screen as a co-anchor of the ""Today"" show's third hour, has become widely recognized as an influential figure in American journalism. An advocate for social justice and an empowering voice for underrepresented communities, Hall's exit has left both her fans and colleagues saddened and questioning NBC's commitment to diversity and inclusion.

The NABJ, a renowned and respected organization that strives to ensure fair and accurate reporting, released a statement expressing its unease and criticism of the network's decision. The association highlighted the significance of having diverse voices in journalism, asserting that they are crucial to providing a comprehensive and balanced representation of society.

As Sarah Glover, NABJ President, aptly stated, ""To lose Hall from the ‘Today’ show, one of the network's flagship programs, is a loss not only for NBC but for all viewers who value the representation of diverse perspectives on their screens.""

The outcry from the NABJ stems from its belief that Tamron Hall's departure reflects a larger systemic issue concerning diversity within the media industry. The association argues that firms like NBC need to prioritize fostering an inclusive environment that encourages the participation and advancement of journalists from all backgrounds. This move is essential to dispel the notion that networks are disregarding the importance of representing the voices and stories of minority communities.

While NBC has yet to respond to the allegations directly, it is not the first time the network has faced such accusations. In an era where newsrooms aim to reflect the diversity of their audiences, the controversy surrounding Hall's departure highlights an ongoing call for increased representation and inclusivity, not only at NBC but across the entire media landscape.

The NABJ's accusations have resonated among advocates for diversity in media, igniting discussions on various platforms. Social media campaigns demanding greater accountability are gaining momentum and putting pressure on NBC and other networks to reevaluate their commitment to promoting racial and cultural diversity.

As the narrative surrounding Tamron Hall's exit continues to evolve, it serves as a reminder of the urgency for news organizations to take proactive steps towards building trust and embracing diverse perspectives. The NABJ's resolute stance reminds us that audiences deserve to see themselves authentically and fairly represented in the media, acknowledging the diverse tapestry that makes up our society as a whole.

As the nation grapples with heightened awareness of social inequality, the events surrounding Tamron Hall's departure challenge us to reflect on the crucial role that newsrooms play in shaping public opinion. It is imperative for networks, including NBC, to address these concerns seriously and take substantive actions that ensure journalists of all backgrounds have an equal opportunity to deliver accurate, unbiased information to viewers worldwide.

In the ongoing conversation surrounding Tamron Hall's departure, one message remains clear - the pursuit of true diversity in journalism must never falter. The future of news reporting relies on fostering an inclusive industry where voices like Hall's not only have a"

gossipcop-5658990975,"Daniel Craig is returning as James Bond once again, even as he reportedly fights to save his marriage to Rachel Weisz at the same time. Craig has already announced his intent to return as 007 in the franchise’s 25th film, and according to the National Enquirer, he’s still struggling to salvage what’s left of his marriage.  The Enquirer’s source claimed at the beginning of 2017, “Rachel and Daniel haven’t been happy for a while, and nearly called it quits last year.” The report claims that the married couple was in two separate filming locations at the beginning of the year, but continued to stay apart even after wrapping their respective films. The Enquirer then claims that they finally reunited in July after not being seen together in ‘554 days’.  According to the sources, the minute the outlet attempted to lock down an exclusive on the couple’s rocky marriage, both Rachel Weisz and Daniel Craig were seen arriving at New York’s Public Theater the next day, prompting the source to add, “The whole thing just seemed like too much of a coincidence. I don’t buy it for a minute.”  When you consider Daniel Craig’s own words, especially in the context of allegedly turning down a $150 million payday to star in two more James Bond films, he had stated, “Being on your own would be sad, sick, and weird. I don’t trust myself. I need that balance.” If these reports are to be believed, then Daniel Craig previously turned down starring in more Bond films to spend time with his family, but now – all of a sudden – he’s back to working on James Bond?  Either the report was never accurate to begin with, or he’s giving up on his marriage to Rachel Weisz. One would hope that the two have worked out whatever was troubling them in the first place, but given their own relationship and marriage histories – and how they’ve both jumped ship on long-term relationships at the drop of a hat – one wouldn’t be faulted for assuming that they are on their way to getting a divorce.  What do you guys think? Are Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz having marriage troubles, and is Daniel’s decision to take on the role of 007 again an indication that he’s giving up on his marriage? Or just a chance to have more career stability and/or cash in on a major paycheck? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.

In a surprising turn of events, seasoned actor Daniel Craig is set to reprise the role of the enigmatic spy, James Bond, for the much-anticipated 26th Bond film, while simultaneously confronting personal struggles within his marriage to accomplished actress Rachel Weisz. Amidst mounting speculation, industry insiders have confirmed that Craig's commitment to both his professional and personal life remains resolute.

Craig's portrayal of the suave British agent has garnered critical acclaim and a loyal fan base, making him one of the most memorable Bond actors in recent history. Following months of deliberation and speculation over whether he would don the iconic tuxedo once more, Craig's decision to return has elicited a collective sigh of relief from fans worldwide.

However, away from the glamour and intrigue that his alter ego brings to the silver screen, the 53-year-old actor finds himself confronted with a different challenge - the preservation of his marriage to fellow industry heavyweight, Rachel Weisz. Reports have recently surfaced claiming that the couple is navigating a period of strain, but sources close to the pair assure that they are fully committed to working through their difficulties.

On the set of the forthcoming Bond installment, Craig has exhibited an unwavering determination and professionalism, subtly masking the personal turmoil he may be experiencing behind closed doors. In testament to his dedication, Craig has been seen engaging with the production team and fellow cast members, focused on delivering another captivating performance that will undoubtedly set the silver screen ablaze.

Unwavering in his pursuit of excellence as both an actor and a committed partner, Craig's return to the role that propelled him to an elite stardom comes as no surprise. Despite being confronted with marital challenges, the actor's decision to take on the cinematic embodiment of James Bond demonstrates his firm belief in the importance of fulfilling personal commitments alongside professional achievements.

As the continuing saga of the world's most renowned super-spy unfolds onscreen, audiences and fans alike can look forward to Craig's captivating portrayal of Bond. Behind the scenes, one can only hope that the actor's resolve and tenacity will enable him to mend the intricacies of his marriage and find solace in the resounding success both in his personal and professional life.

While many are eagerly anticipating the thrills and excitement that will undoubtedly follow Daniel Craig's return as James Bond, it is equally important that we remember the complex personal journey he embarks upon, persistently striving to balance his responsibilities as both an actor and a devoted husband.

Statement from a representative of Daniel Craig: ""Daniel remains steadfastly dedicated to his craft and the challenges he faces in his personal life. Despite the speculation surrounding their relationship, he and Rachel are committed to one another, working together to overcome their current tribulations while honoring their professional obligations.""

As fans eagerly await the release of the next installment in the illustrious Bond series, one can only hope that Daniel Craig's triumphant return as James Bond serves as not only a testament to his acting prowess, but also as an inspiring example of persistence, resilience, and the ability to conquer numerous challenges simultaneously."

gossipcop-4774142356,"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired. T",1,en,"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.","In the midst of Hollywood's glitz and glamour, a somber cloud looms over actress Katie Holmes, whose personal life has become the subject of much speculation and concern. Recent reports have surfaced, casting a shadow over her relationships with Jamie Foxx, her current boyfriend, and her former husband, the renowned actor Tom Cruise. The whispers have even extended to her relationship with her beloved daughter, Suri. 

These rumors have left those who have followed Katie's journey from her days on the iconic television series ""Dawson's Creek"" to her current pursuits in the world of entertainment deeply saddened. As an A-list actress, Katie's every move has been scrutinized by an eager public, but recent developments have delved into the most personal aspects of her life, unraveling heartache and turmoil. 

The alleged strain in Katie's bond with Jamie Foxx paints a picture of a relationship struggling under the weight of adversity. Speculations about the couple's compatibility and commitment have fueled rumors of an impending breakup. This distressing possibility leaves many to wonder what lies ahead for Katie, who has managed to maintain a dignified silence amid the frenzy of speculation.

Adding to the complexity of the situation, the rumors surrounding Katie's relationship with her ex-husband, Tom Cruise, have resurfaced once again. The Hollywood power couple's highly publicized divorce years ago was met with great sorrow, and it seems that the echoes of that heartbreak still resonate today. Though Katie and Tom have both moved on, whispers of lingering tensions and unresolved issues persist.

Furthermore, it is disheartening to acknowledge the claims surrounding Katie's relationship with her cherished daughter, Suri. As a devoted mother, Katie's utmost priority has always been to provide a stable and loving environment for her daughter to flourish. However, these reports insinuate a fracture in their bond, suggesting a strain between mother and daughter.

It is important to recognize that these reports are based solely on rumors and speculation, yet the impact they have on Katie's life is undeniable. The toll they take on her emotional well-being and privacy cannot be ignored. As journalists, it is our duty to present the facts, but we must do so with empathy and sensitivity, keeping in mind the toll such rumors can take on the individuals involved.

In the whirlwind world of Hollywood, the personal lives of celebrities often become a spectacle. However, it is essential to remember that behind the glitz and the glamour, they are human beings with their own struggles and vulnerabilities. Poor Katie Holmes, indeed, as she navigates the tumultuous sea of speculation that surrounds her relationships with Jamie Foxx, Tom Cruise, and Suri. As observers, it is crucial that we approach these reports with caution, understanding the potential consequences they may have on the lives of those involved."

Childhood pal Ninaki Priddy opened up about Prince Harry's fiancée, claiming her desire to be famous outweighed her commitment to her marriage to film producer Trevor Engelson.  Meghan married her ex back in 2011 on a Jamaican beach. They split two years later after she landed her role in Suits, which filmed in Toronto. Previously it was thought the pair grew apart after Meghan spent months filming in Canada and her beau was based in LA.  Ninaki says otherwise.  (Image: Getty Images North America)  (Image: REX/Shutterstock)  ""The way she handled it, Trevor definitely had the rug pulled out from under him. He was hurt,"" she said, explaining that while Trevor was heartbroken, Meghan was less affected,"" she told Mail Online.  Prior to their split, Ninaki - who was maid of honour at the wedding - said the pair doted on each other and Trevor would have done anything for the actress.  ""Then, after the wedding, it was like a light switched off. There’s Meghan before fame and Meghan after fame. After three seasons of Suits, she called me to say the marriage was over.  The pair first met aged two at Hollywood’s private Little Red School House before they went to the Immaculate Heart girls’ high school in Los Angeles at the age of 11.  Following a close friendship that she describes as 'sisterly', Ninaki says the pair eventually fell out over how Meghan and ex-husband - who the ex Suits star met when she was just 23 - split.  She explains she went to visit Trevor who was heartbroken over their split, while Meghan seemed less affected.

""I think it’s a very fanciful dream to believe that you just walk into a Prince Charming.  ""I know the Royal Family was something she found fascinating.

But for Victoria Adams, then known as Posh Spice, it turned out to be a key moment in her personal life too.  The video would soon catch the eye of Premier League soccer player David Beckham, who immediately picked out the brunette Spice Girl in her black PVC catsuit and matching gloves.  He declared: “That’s the girl for me and I'm going to get her! She's my idea of perfection. I knew that if she wanted me, we would be together forever.”  They later met at a Manchester United soccer players’ lounge, where it was love at first sight—although Victoria later admitted she was a little tipsy at the time.  The couple married in 1999 and had four children; sons Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz, and Harper. The pair have also forged a successful brand over their almost 20-year marriage, with Victoria starting a successful fashion label after attempting a less-than-stellar solo music career.  However, it hasn’t all been so rosy. The couple have endured a number of accusations of infidelity on David’s behalf, including from his former personal assistant Rebecca Loos in 2004.  The couple’s former nanny, Abbie Gibson, came forward in 2005 to stay their marriage was a sham, a claim hotly disputed by the Beckhams.  David retired from professional soccer in 2013, playing his final game in boots with the names of his wife and children stitched on to them.  He has consistently ranked among the highest earners in the sport. His net worth as of March 2017 is $450 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth—a number which Victoria matches through her own earnings.  As their marriage nears the two decade mark, we look back at the couple’s best moments.

gossipcop-920346,"Craig Mack, the rapper who had the first hit on P. Diddy’s iconic hip-hop label Bad Boy Records, died on Monday. He was 47.  According to the New York Daily News, the rapper died of heart failure at his Walterboro, South Carolina home. His death was confirmed by Mack’s former producer Alvin Toney.  “Craig Mack, you were the first artist to release music on Bad Boy and gave us our first hit,” Sean “Diddy” Combs tells Rolling Stone in a statement. “You always followed your heart and you had an energy that was out of this world. You believed in me and you believed in Bad Boy. I will never forget what you did for hip-hop. You inspired me, and I will continue to try to keep inspiring others. We will always love you.”  Mack is best known for the indelible classic “Flava in Ya Ear,” – a Top 10 hit in 1994 that sold over a million copies – and its subsequent remix featuring Notorious B.I.G, LL Cool J, Busta Rhymes and Rampage. The original would eventually reach No. 1 on the Billboard rap songs chart and No. 9 on the Hot 100 and earn a Best Rap Solo Performance Grammy nomination. “Craig is hip-hop’s George Clinton, because his stuff is really off the wall,” Diddy once told The New York Times. “He does what’s from his heart, which is where it starts for him. But his energy comes from somewhere else.”  Mack, born in the Bronx in 1970, helped make Bad Boy Records synonymous with New York hip-hop, kickstarting the label that would eventually make stars of Notorious B.I.G., Mase, 112 and more. In a 1995 profile in The New York Times, Mack said he was hooked on rap by his cousins at age nine and began to write his own lyrics at age 12. “I knew I wanted to be like LL Cool J and Run-D.M.C.,” Mack recalled.  He became friendly with members of another famous New York rap group, EPMD, and accompanied them on tour. He did odd jobs for the group and did not perform, but Mack still remembered the experience as a valuable one. “All the time I was getting an education learning about the studio and the road,” he explained.  Mack first started rhyming in the late 1980s. Under the name MC EZ, listed alongside DJ Troup, he released a single 12-inch on Fresh Records in 1988: “Just Rhymin'” b/w “Get Retarded.” The nimble B-side would become a fave among rap fans and was interpolated by Dr. Dre and LL Cool J for the single “Zoom.” Mack eventually met Diddy – who was at that time looking to set up Bad Boy after being fired from Uptown Records – outside the club Mecca in Manhattan. Mack freestyled for Diddy and earned a record contract.  After breaking through with “Flava in Ya Ear” and its accompanying gold-certified album Project: Funk Da World, Mack struggled to replicate his initial success. He left Bad Boy Records and released Operation: Get Down in 1997 but did not score a hit from the album. Mack later appeared in the video for Diddy’s hit “I Need a Girl Part 1,” but his solo career never regained momentum.  Mack eventually became a minister in South Carolina and appeared to renounce his former life as a rapper in a 2012 video. The video, taken at the Overcomer Ministry commune in Walterboro, S.C., shows the group’s pastor Ralph Gordon Stair talking to Mack. “Craig Mack is dead,” Stair tells the congregation. “We have somebody that used to be Craig Mack.”  In Can’t Stop, Won’t Stop: The Bad Boy Story, the 2017 documentary chronicling the rise of Combs’ revered label and reunion tour, Mack can be heard discussing the possibility of returning to the stage, but declined because of his religious beliefs.  “I don’t think anybody was disappointed,” Combs told Billboard last year. “We kind of respected his wishes. In this game, man, people don’t realize the music industry only has a one percent rate ratio, so sometimes it’s very stressful and it brings you only to places that you can go to and should go to, which is God.

gossipcop-1551062653,"  George Clooney and his wife, Amal, attend the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. (Alberto Pizzoli/AFP via Getty Images)  Once the ultimate bachelor — and two-time People’s Sexiest Man Alive cover model — George Clooney entered entirely new territory this week.  The Oscar-winning actor and his human-rights-lawyer wife of two years, Amal, announced Tuesday that they are the proud new parents of twins, Ella and Alexander.  Clooney has donned many hats in his life — actor, director, producer and activist, but fatherhood had always seemed far away. Was it the early-onset-salt-and-pepper hair? The coterie of models who found themselves on his arm for fleeting moments over the years? The insistence by tabloids and fellow co-stars that it was time for him to settle down? Maybe. Or perhaps it was the simple fact that Clooney himself said again and again that he would not reproduce. In several interviews. Many, many times. For many, many years.  A first-time father at 56, Clooney was often asked throughout his career whether the single life was his ultimate future. But after proposing marriage to Amal in April 2014 and marrying her that September (as well as sharing wedding photos with People magazine in the United States and Hello magazine in Britain), it seemed as if anything was possible for the man who once said, “I don’t see myself ever having kids.”  But it was a long road to get there. “I don’t have that gene that people have to replicate,” he told People in 2006.  When Esquire asked him why he wasn’t married with kids, he replied, “I haven’t had aspirations in that way, ever.” And as for people who thought it was weird that a man in his 50s was single and childless? “What do you do? Should I go, ‘I got to get me some kids right now!’ and rush out and impregnate someone?”  Clooney seemed to express frustration when asked how he could ever relate to the fathers he occasionally portrays onscreen. His answer: “Well, I’m also not running for president, but I played that role in ‘Ides of March.’ I wasn’t an actual lawyer when I did ‘Michael Clayton,’ and I don’t fire people for a living like I did in ‘Up in the Air.’ ”  “I keep saying I’ll never get married again or have children but people just don’t want to believe me,” Clooney told Britain’s Daily Express just three months before popping the question to his now-wife.  Of course, celebrities are people, too, and it shouldn’t surprise anyone that a man might change his mind around the midcentury mark. And Clooney is certainly not alone in choosing to wait till later in life to welcome a child into the family: Comedian Steve Martin became a father at age 67 in 2012; Elton John was 63 when he had a baby via a surrogate in 2010; and Chris Noth was 53 when he welcomed his only child in 2008.  Perhaps it’s the fact that Clooney always seemed so delightfully and devilishly Clooney-ish that made his bachelordom seem like the only constant in our ever-changing popular culture. But we can rest easy knowing that despite some hesitation about having a family over the years, his sense of humor has remained steady throughout.  “Ella, Alexander and Amal are all healthy, happy and doing fine,” the statement announcing the birth of the twins read. “George is sedated and should recover in a few days.”",1,en,"George Clooney and his wife, Amal, attend the 2016 Cannes Film Festival.

In the now-deleted post, Barr made an egregious racial comparison between Valerie Jarrett, a former advisor to President Barack Obama, and an ape.

The racially insensitive tweet, which sparked immediate outrage and intense backlash across social media platforms, invoked a painful history of dehumanizing African Americans. ABC swiftly responded, condemning Barr's comments in the strongest possible terms and promptly announcing the show's cancellation.

ABC, a major American broadcasting network, had rebooted the popular sitcom, 'Roseanne,' earlier this year to great success. The revival of the show, which originally aired from 1988 to 1997, delivered impressive ratings and resonated with audiences eager to see the blue-collar Conner family return to their television screens.

The network's decision to cancel 'Roseanne' underscores its commitment to promoting inclusivity, diversity, and tolerance. ABC's swift action reflects its refusal to tolerate any form of racism or prejudice in its programming.

The tweet in question unleashed a barrage of disdain from the public, including prominent figures within the entertainment industry and political sphere. Valerie Jarrett, the primary target of Barr's offensive remarks, did not respond directly but has been praised for her grace and perseverance during this ordeal.

Jarrett, who served as a senior advisor to President Barack Obama, has been an influential and well-respected figure in American politics. She is known for her dedication to public service and her efforts in advancing important policies during her tenure in the White House.

The incident serves as a stark reminder that even in today's connected world, where social media allows for instant communication, we must remain vigilant against the divisive forces of ignorance and prejudice. Barr's tweet and its subsequent repercussions highlight the need for meaningful dialogues surrounding racial equality and the recognition of the harm caused by such divisive language.

While 'Roseanne' stood as a cultural touchstone for many viewers, the network's commitment to promoting inclusiveness leaves no room for tolerance of racism or any other form of discrimination. ABC's decisive cancellation of the show signals an important turning point in the quest for increased representation and respect for all individuals regardless of their background.

As the nation grapples with social and political issues surrounding racial equality and civil discourse, incidents like these continue to serve as a reminder that there is still much work to be done. In prioritizing respect, understanding, and acceptance, we can build stronger and more inclusive communities that foster unity and progress."

The Backstreet Boys might have found a new member in James Corden — or so he hopes — as the late-night host performed alongside the boy band for a revamped version of their hit single during Tuesday night’s Late Late Show.  Jokingly promoting their new boy band, dubbed “James Street,” group members Nick Carter, Howie Dorough, AJ McLean, Kevin Richardson and Brian Littrell performed an mock version of their 1999 single, “Larger Than Life,” changing it to “Late Late-r Than Life” to reflect Corden’s 12:37 p.m. broadcast.

gossipcop-860217,"A CONTROVERSIAL reality TV star has courted controversy after admitting that she used drugs while pregnant with her daughter less than a year after admitting she nearly died of a heroin overdose.  Jenelle Evans’ past has been notoriously sketchy but the MTV Teen Mom 2 star says that despite the fact she has gotten her life back on track and that she’s “not a bad kid any more”, online speculation over her parenting methods is forcing Child Protection Services on her.  It comes after fans accused the star of child abuse after her son, Kaiser, begged for food on the TV show. The shocking footage sparked a Twitter backlash with the hashtag #SaveKaiser and cost the mother-of-three her job as an ambassador with Blue Apron.  In her memoir, Read Between the Lines: From the Diary of a Teenage Mom, Ms Evans admitted that at the peak of her drug addiction she was using heroin “four or five times a day”.  “I was hooked,” she said of her abusive relationship, which saw her arrested for possession of marijuana and heroin, according to Radar.  This week, Ms Evans appeared on The Brand podcast and admitted that while she was pregnant with daughter Ensley, she tested positive for THC, the principal psychoactive found in cannabis.  “I’m not going to lie about that. I tested positive for THC,” the reality star, 26, said.  Daughter Ensley did not test positive.  Ms Evans said the chemical compound was found shortly after she had given birth to her daughter just over one year ago after Child Protective Services asked her if she had smoked during her pregnancy.  “I said, ‘I did within the past 30 days,’” she explained.  “I said, ‘I have really bad esophageal spasms and I throw up every five minutes. I can’t eat.’ And they said, ‘OK, some mums do that. We are not here to judge. We are writing down your information.’”  She said that when Child Protective Services arrived for the wellness check, they closed the case soon after.

Swift's new album 1989 has already shot to the top on iTunes and has received favorable reviews from critics but her label, Big Machine Records, might not have been so confident that this offering from Swift would be a success.  ""I wasn't necessarily nervous about this album,"" Swift said. ""I think my label might have been a little nervous but they'll never say it now.""  Swift, whose roots were initially planted in country music, is now going full-steam ahead into Top 40 fare with 1989.  ""I knew I wanted to change the way I did things creatively,"" Swift told the View co-hosts. ""I knew I wanted to keep people on their toes. I didn't want anyone to have their feelings hurt by me changing directions creatively, because that's never the intention.""  With lyrics about empowerment and ridding one's self of negativity, Swift is once again being lauded as a feminist for a younger generation.  ""It's interesting how feminism has come up in conversation so much more in the last year,"" Swift said. ""I was never really taught the definition of feminism when I was a little girl and I wish I had been.""  Whether her constant astonishment at her own overwhelming success is genuine or just false modesty is still undeterminable. Confident as she may be, Swift admits that she still fears failure.

After officially ending their relationship in 2015, the Amazing Spider-man co-stars joined the small but growing club of celebrities with friendly separations.

While Emma spent some time in the UK earlier this year shooting her new film The Favourite, a further trip to London paved the way for them to reconnect. “Andrew’s feelings for Emma never softened and now they are growing close once again,” the source said.  Emma, 28, and Andrew, 34, enjoyed an on again off again romance for four years. In the early 2010’s, these two were Hollywood’s sweethearts after meeting during screentest for The Amazing Spider-Man. The couple went public in 2011, via the classy and showbiz means of a joint appearance during her Saturday Night Live monologue. Everything is love and smiles until rumors aired that the pair was taking a break from their relationship in early 2015. They finally announced their so-called definitive separation later that year.  Yet, here we are, cheering for Emma and Andrew once again.  “The familiarity they have with each other seems to bring them back to a place to try again and again.

Gossip Cop can reveal what’s going on.","In the world of entertainment, rumors and gossip often cling to our beloved celebrities like shadows, attempting to tarnish the sterling reputations they have painstakingly built. Recently, a preposterous report emerged, accusing the talented artist Ed Sheeran of a heinous betrayal toward his long-time friend, Taylor Swift, supposedly involving another notable singer, Katy Perry. However, after thorough investigation, Gossip Cop can confidently reveal the truth behind these unfounded claims.

The absurd notion that Ed Sheeran, an acclaimed musician and beacon of integrity, could have violated the sacred bonds of friendship with Taylor Swift is not only baseless but also a blight on the realm of responsible journalism. We, as responsible members of the press, have the duty to disseminate accurate information, devoid of sensationalism and falsehoods. Therefore, as concerned individuals committed to the truth, we undertook an exhaustive investigation into these claims to set the record straight.

Our inquiries, met with diligence and attention to detail, have concluded that there is absolutely no shred of evidence to support the outlandish allegations made against Mr. Sheeran. What emerged from our investigation is a tangled web of misconstrued events that spun out of control into a frenzy of untruths. In fact, far from any purported discord, Sheeran and Swift's friendship continues to flourish, cemented by mutual respect, admiration, and unwavering loyalty.

It is disappointing that irresponsible reporting can sow seeds of doubt and create unnecessary friction between esteemed artists who have long-standing friendships. Such provocations only serve to divide and harm, rather than propagate the spirit of camaraderie that should prevail within the creative industry.

It is crucial, now more than ever, that we approach news stories with discretion and truthfulness, ensuring that we maintain the integrity of our craft. Gossip Cop is steadfast in its commitment to weeding out baseless claims and providing the public with the authentic stories they deserve. We encourage readers to seek reliable sources and exercise critical thinking when faced with sensationalist reports that seek to exploit the reputation of sensational artists like Ed Sheeran.

In conclusion, the recent melodramatic account attempting to malign the unshakable bond between Ed Sheeran and Taylor Swift can be confidently dismissed as a fallacy. The weight of evidence gathered by Gossip Cop etches absolution into the narrative, putting to rest any notions of betrayal. As a community, we must stand united against the pernicious nature of gossip, refusing to be swayed by unsubstantiated claims and preserving the artistic connections that enrich our lives."

Mike Flynn and the Russian Ambassador. Sessions affirmed that this investigation is being pursued with utmost urgency and determination.

During the interview, the Attorney General highlighted the severity of such leaks, which pose a direct threat to national security. The leaking of classified information undermines the trust between allies, jeopardizes ongoing intelligence operations, and compromises the integrity of the United States' intelligence community.

Sessions emphasized the Justice Department's relentless commitment to unearthing the truth behind these leaks. By deploying its vast resources, legal expertise, and state-of-the-art investigative techniques, the Department aims to swiftly identify the origin of the leak and hold the responsible parties accountable for their actions.

The leaked phone call in question, involving Gen. Mike Flynn and the Russian Ambassador, has been a subject of intense scrutiny since it gained public attention. The nature of the discussion, the parties involved, and the subsequent unauthorized exposure has raised significant concerns about potential breaches of protocol and impropriety on multiple levels.

The Attorney General stressed that the investigation would be conducted meticulously and impartially, ensuring all relevant facts are thoroughly examined. Sessions further confirmed that should the inquiry lead to concrete evidence of criminal behavior or a violation of federal law, the Justice Department stands ready to take decisive legal action.

It is important to note that leaks of sensitive conversations, especially those concerning national security, not only undermine domestic law enforcement and diplomatic efforts but also weaken the trust of American citizens in their government's ability to safeguard classified information. By holding the perpetrators accountable, the Justice Department seeks to restore public faith in the nation's intelligence community and reestablish the standing of the United States on the global stage.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions' affirmation regarding the aggressive pursuit of this investigation signifies the Department's commitment to preserving the security and integrity of the United States. As this inquiry unfolds, the nation will closely observe the outcomes and anticipate justice being served – ensuring that those who perpetuate unlawful acts compromising national security are brought to account."

According to Deadline, the Bridesmaids star is being considered to play Cheetah, a classic comic-book villain, in the upcoming highly anticipated movie sequel.","Kristen Wiig Considered as Leading Villain in Wonder Woman Sequel

In the world of superhero movies, a captivating villain can make or break a film. And when it comes to creating an iconic antagonist, few heroes have a rogues' gallery as diverse and intriguing as Wonder Woman. As plans continue to unfold for the highly anticipated sequel to the record-breaking blockbuster, news has surfaced that actress Kristen Wiig might just be the one bringing a legendary foe to life on the big screen.

According to a recent report by Deadline, the immensely talented Kristen Wiig is currently in talks to join the cast of the upcoming Wonder Woman sequel. If negotiations are successful, Wiig will be entrusted with the role of Cheetah, a classic villain from the pages of DC Comics. This casting decision has already generated immense excitement among fans and industry insiders alike.

Wiig's impressive repertoire spans across various genres, showcasing her incredible versatility as an actress. From her gut-busting performance in the hilarious hit Bridesmaids to her fearless portrayal of a troubled mother in The Skeleton Twins, Wiig has consistently proven her ability to captivate audiences with her raw talent. Her potential transformation into Cheetah will undoubtedly be yet another triumph for the accomplished actress.

Cheetah, a character who has played a central role in Wonder Woman's comic book adventures since 1943, presents an intriguing challenge for any performer. With her agility, strength, and cunning, Cheetah is a formidable opponent who has provided Wonder Woman with countless battles of epic proportion. Only an actress of exceptional caliber can truly embody the complexity and ferocity of this classic nemesis.

Should the negotiations conclude successfully, Kristen Wiig will undoubtedly add a thrilling layer to the highly anticipated sequel, which is set to reunite director Patty Jenkins and actress Gal Gadot.

gossipcop-1289487505,"After years of overexposure thanks to his star-making turn in Twilight, Robert Pattinson values his privacy.  The actor appears on the September cover of GQ where he explained why he chooses to stay very quiet when it comes to his private life.  “I always think the risk reward is very much weighted in the wrong direction,” Pattinson, 31, said of opening up in interviews. “If I could stay silent, I would.”  Pattinson has been dating singer F.K.A. Twigs since 2014, and recently told Howard Stern they were “kind of” engaged. But when asked by GQ if he was getting married, the actor — who revealed he calls his girlfriend Twigs — responded with a noncommittal “eh.”  Daniel Jackson/GQ  Pattinson said that he went to therapy a few years ago – and his therapist commented that he was good at “talking without saying anything.” He said he uses that skill in all his interviews. The Good Time actor explained that he chooses to stay private so people don’t form ideas about his personality that may later change and label him as dishonest.  RELATED: Celeb Quotes of the Day: Jennifer Lawrence, Emma Stone & More  “I want to be misunderstood,” he told the magazine after declining to talk about anything personal. “People are always changing, and the more you put something down in print, people form opinions and they’re constantly creating who they think you are. If you do something that contradicts that, or if you do something which goes out of that box, then you can look like a liar or something like that.”  FROM PEN: Chrissy Metz on ‘This Is Us’, Crying on Set, and Her Body Positivity  The actor also revealed the great lengths he’d go to during the height of the Twilight whirlwind to a little privacy. He recalled how he would have different cars parked around Los Angeles with a full change of clothes. If he noticed he was being followed by paparazzi, he would pop into the garages, change, and leave in a different car.  He would also try to confuse photographers by having all of his friends order different rides out of restaurants when they were together and sending the cars to different places after trading outfits with one of his friends. Pattinson also recalled riding in trunks several times to hide from the photographers – and once drove around all night when one was tailing him to find out where his new house is.  “There are ways to disappear, like, fairly easily,” he said. “It just involves effort, and most people can’t be bothered to put the effort in.”  Good Time hits theaters August 11.",1,en,"After years of overexposure thanks to his star-making turn in Twilight, Robert Pattinson values his privacy. The actor appears on the September cover of GQ where he explained why he chooses to stay very quiet when it comes to his private life.","In a rare and candid interview, world-renowned actor Robert Pattinson opens up about the challenges he has faced in protecting his cherished privacy following his meteoric rise to fame in the highly successful Twilight saga. Gracing the cover of the esteemed fashion and lifestyle magazine, GQ, for their upcoming September issue, Pattinson sheds light on why he intentionally maintains a veil of secrecy surrounding his personal life.

Since catapulting to stardom with his captivating portrayal of the brooding vampire Edward Cullen, Pattinson has become a household name, drawing the adoration of millions of fans worldwide. Yet, with such widespread fame comes the burdensome side effects of constant media scrutiny and invasion of personal space.

Addressing his decision to shroud his private life away from the prying eyes of the public, the British actor reveals the paramount importance he places on having a semblance of normalcy. In these exclusive revelations to GQ, Pattinson eloquently expresses that the relentless exposure he endured during the Twilight era has indelibly shaped his perspective on fame and privacy.

Acknowledging the impact that his sudden megastardom had on both his personal and professional life, Pattinson confesses that the incessant attention left him feeling vulnerable and exposed. Struggling to reconcile his genuine self with the tabloid caricature created by opportunistic paparazzi, he sought solace in the sanctuary of privacy, yearning for a respite from the relentless media glare.

In the GQ interview, Pattinson emphasizes that it is not a desire to court mystery or promote a reclusive image that prompts him to maintain a low profile. Instead, it is an innate need to find solitude and regain control over his own narrative in an industry that often thrives on public fascination and gossip. As the actor delves deeper into his reasons, it becomes increasingly clear that this longing for privacy stems from a fundamental search for authenticity and personal growth, untethered from the trappings of fame.

Throughout the article, Pattinson articulates the detrimental effect that sustained, unwarranted exposure can have on an individual's mental well-being, citing the negative impact it had on those closest to him. With refreshing candor, he explains that the public's insatiable appetite for every trivial detail of his private life has a corrosive effect on personal relationships and hinders the possibility of genuine connections.

In a climate where many public figures willingly embrace the invasive nature of celebrity, Pattinson's uncompromising stance serves as a compelling reminder of the inherent right to privacy. Though not without its challenges, the actor's steadfast commitment to guarding his personal life represents a refusal to surrender the essence of his identity for the sake of public consumption.

As Robert Pattinson graces the cover of GQ's September issue, his decision to offer a rare glimpse into his thoughts reveals a thoughtful and introspective artist, fiercely dedicated to preserving what remains sacred to him. By sharing his experiences and intentions, he challenges the prevailing notion that fame necessitates a surrender of privacy, encouraging us to reconsider our voyeuristic tendencies and fostering a renewed appreciation for the boundaries that every individual deserves."

UPDATE (1/9/18): Tessa Thompson has clarified her statements regarded Time’s Up and Lena Dunham in a Twitter post.  EARLIER: Tessa Thompson is among the many women taking part in the Time’s Up initiative, which made its presence felt at last night’s Golden Globes ceremony. In an Instagram comment, the star of “Thor: Ragnarok” said planning for the red carpet the day before the event required “6 hours, 60 artists, 8 activists and a lot of coffee.” And one of those people, Thompson said, was not Lena Dunham.  In the celebratory photo Thompson posted yesterday are Michelle Williams, Billie Jean King, Rashida Jones, Susan Sarandon, Laura Dern — and, on the end of the middle row, far right, is Dunham. The “Girls” creator and star has lain low of late; the last Tweet she wrote was an apology for casting doubt on Aurora Perrineau’s rape accusation. And, according to Thompson, her participation in Time’s Up planning was limited to the photo op: “Lena was not anywhere present in our group during the countless hours of work for the last two months.”  Thompson’s statement, which came in response to several commenters questioning why Dunham was in the picture at all, reads in full:  “Lena was not anywhere present in our group during the countless hours of work for the last two months. We hosted an open house for actresses for red carpet messaging and Lena presence was a surprise to us all. This is a time of reckoning. And for many, a re-education. So many women also have real work to do. I’m afraid it’s too nuanced a conversation to have on this platform. But I hear you, and know that your thoughts and words are not lost on me. It’s been discussed”  What’s next for the initiative remains to be seen, but it shows no signs of slowing down. Most attendees wore black last night in recognition of the sexual-harassment problem in Hollywood and beyond, and Time’s Up was brought up several times throughout the ceremony.  When asked to comment by IndieWire, Dunham responded, “I was honored to be invited to the meeting by a close friend and to observe the work that these amazing women have been doing the past few months. For highly personal reasons, I’ve been unable to join previous efforts but being asked to be a part of this celebratory moment was truly beautiful.

EARLIER: Tessa Thompson is among the many women taking part in the Time’s Up initiative, which made its presence felt at last night’s Golden Globes ceremony. In an Instagram comment, the star of “Thor: Ragnarok” said planning for the red carpet the day before the event required “6 hours, 60 artists, 8 activists and a lot of coffee.” And one of those people, Thompson said, was not Lena Dunham.  In the celebratory photo Thompson posted yesterday are Michelle Williams, Billie Jean King, Rashida Jones, Susan Sarandon, Laura Dern — and, on the end of the middle row, far right, is Dunham. The “Girls” creator and star has lain low of late; the last Tweet she wrote was an apology for casting doubt on Aurora Perrineau’s rape accusation. And, according to Thompson, her participation in Time’s Up planning was limited to the photo op: “Lena was not anywhere present in our group during the countless hours of work for the last two months.”  Thompson’s statement, which came in response to several commenters questioning why Dunham was in the picture at all, reads in full:  “Lena was not anywhere present in our group during the countless hours of work for the last two months. We hosted an open house for actresses for red carpet messaging and Lena presence was a surprise to us all. This is a time of reckoning. And for many, a re-education. So many women also have real work to do. I’m afraid it’s too nuanced a conversation to have on this platform. But I hear you, and know that your thoughts and words are not lost on me. It’s been discussed”  What’s next for the initiative remains to be seen, but it shows no signs of slowing down. Most attendees wore black last night in recognition of the sexual-harassment problem in Hollywood and beyond, and Time’s Up was brought up several times throughout the ceremony.  When asked to comment by IndieWire, Dunham responded, “I was honored to be invited to the meeting by a close friend and to observe the work that these amazing women have been doing the past few months. For highly personal reasons, I’ve been unable to join previous efforts but being asked to be a part of this celebratory moment was truly beautiful. I’ve worked with Tessa and respect her artistry and admire her consistent candor.”  Additional reporting by Jenna Marotta."

gossipcop-7658353025,"“A Star Is Born” is that thing we always yearn for but so rarely get to see: a transcendent Hollywood movie. It’s the fourth remake of a story that dates back to 1932, but this one has a look and vibe all its own — rapturous and swooning, but also delicate and intimate and luminous. It’s set in the present day, but in spirit it’s a sophisticated retro ’70s drama built around the uncanny flow of feeling that develops between the movie’s two stars: Bradley Cooper, who plays Jackson Maine, a hard-drinking, bad-ol’-boy redneck rock ‘n’ roller who is still hanging on as a popular attraction but has lost the lust for what he’s doing, and Lady Gaga, in her fetching and accomplished movie-star debut, as Ally, an ingenuous, fresh-faced singer-songwriter who becomes his lover and stage partner before rocketing on her own into the new pop stratosphere. She takes off as he slowly crashes — that’s the soapy tragic “Star Is Born” concept. But what the movie does is to take this fabled melodramatic romantic seesaw and turn it into something indelibly heartfelt and revealing. Cooper directed the movie himself, working from a script he co-wrote with Eric Roth and Will Fetters, and to say that he does a good job would be to understate his accomplishment. As a filmmaker, Bradley Cooper gets right onto the high wire, staging scenes that take their time and play out with a shaggy intimacy that’s shorn of the usual “beats.” The new “Star Is Born” is a total emotional knockout, but it’s also a movie that gets you to believe, at every step, in the complicated rapture of the story it’s telling. More Reviews Venice Film review: 'Isis, Tomorrow. The Lost Souls of Mosul' Telluride Film Review: 'They'll Love Me When I'm Dead' The 1976 version, starring Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson, had some terrific cornball love songs, but they didn’t belong anywhere near the stadium-rock stage, and neither did Streisand, which is part of why the movie came off as borderline ludicrous. It seemed stranded, with a kind of campy sincere ineptitude, between three worlds: Old Hollywood, New Hollywood, and Barbra Streisand rock-princess fantasy. But from the electrifying opening moments of the new version, in which Jackson, boozy and raw, with his sunburned squint and hard-bitten shit-kicker sexiness, takes the stage of a gigantic stadium and launches into a grinding slow rocker that sounds like “Victim of Love”-era Eagles as done by the Allman Brothers, the movie is thrillingly authentic. That’s no minor accomplishment. Hollywood almost never succeeds in nailing the rock world, but “A Star Is Born,” though a love story through and through, is the most lived-in rock ‘n’ roll movie since “Almost Famous.” And that absolute looks right, sounds right, feels right verisimilitude sets the stage for everything that follows. Jackson, who looks to be in his mid-40s, has been around long enough that he now occupies a grey zone between legend and nostalgia. He can still fill an arena full of screaming fans, and his old hits have become classic-rock chestnuts, but his sound and persona have long slipped out of the zeitgeist. His whole outlaw look — the beard and rancher’s hat, the Kristofferson-meets-Skynyrd soused macho twinkle — mark him as a charismatic relic, and the grand irony is this: What that look, and sound, are all about is an era when rock ‘n’ roll strutted its “authenticity,” but now that he’s out of date, Jackson’s authenticity looks more than ever like a showbiz conceit, frozen in amber. It’s a part he’s playing, an image he’s working — and secretly struggling — to keep alive. He’s got a signature ballad that goes “Maybe it’s time to let the old ways die,” and when he wrote it (long ago), he probably didn’t know that he was talking about himself. In the first of many telling jump cuts, the film leaps from his on-stage glory to Jackson slinking into the back of his car, weary and alone, grabbing the bottle of gin he’s got stashed there. He takes a guzzle, and Coop",1,en,“A Star Is Born” is that thing we always yearn for but so rarely get to see: a transcendent Hollywood movie.,"In an industry overflowing with formulaic franchises and predictable plotlines, a rare cinematic gem has emerged to captivate audiences and remind us why we fell in love with the magic of movies. ""A Star Is Born,"" with its magnetic allure and unparalleled brilliance, has shattered expectations and reignited our collective cinematic passion. Venturing beyond the realms of conventional storytelling, this transcendent Hollywood masterpiece has firmly established itself as a beacon of artistic brilliance.

As the credits roll, one cannot help but surrender to the enchanting power of this audacious work of art. Renowned for its ability to uplift and transport spectators to a realm of pure escapism, Hollywood has consistently strived for the extraordinary, yet often fails to deliver. However, in ""A Star Is Born,"" director Bradley Cooper has masterfully weaved together a symphony of emotions that transcends the confines of typical filmmaking.

This cinematic masterpiece exudes a rare authenticity, crafting an intricate narrative that resonates long after the theater lights have dimmed. Cooper, who also stars in this labor of love, delivers a performance that can only be described as mesmeric. His portrayal of Jackson Maine, a seasoned musician plagued by personal demons, is nothing short of transformative. With every note he sings, Cooper reveals a vulnerability and rawness that pierces through the screen, leaving audiences breathless and profoundly moved.

Opposite Cooper, a radiant yet equally captivating Lady Gaga, in her acting debut, astonishes as the talented yet undiscovered Ally. The depth of Lady Gaga's artistry shines through in her soul-stirring performances, laying bare her character's dreams, struggles, and heartaches. Their effortless on-screen chemistry intertwines with the music, creating an indelible connection that reverberates within the depths of our souls.

But it is not solely the brilliance of the leading duo that ignites the enchantment of ""A Star Is Born."" The film's compelling exploration of complex themes such as love, fame, and artistic integrity, elevates it far above its peers. Fueled by resonating melodies and compelling lyrics, the original soundtrack serves as a seamless companion to the on-screen journey, further elevating the film's mesmerizing allure.

In an industry that has long been accused of sameness and redundancy, ""A Star Is Born"" emerges as a testament to the power of innovation and unyielding creativity. With its uncompromising commitment to authenticity and its unwavering dedication to crafting a visually breathtaking experience, it will undoubtedly carve its place among the annals of Hollywood's most iconic films.

Indeed, ""A Star Is Born"" is that rare cinematic phenomenon we eternally yearn for but so rarely encounter. It is a moment, frozen in time, where hearts are touched, dreams are reignited, and the power of the silver screen propels us into a transcendent realm. Embrace the opportunity to witness the birth of a cinematic legend; savor the experience, for we may not witness such brilliance again for years to come."

With HBO exploring five different GoT spinoff concepts, “we’d be lucky to get one that we’re very, very excited about, and we did get that. We’re just starting the search for a director… we have to cast it. We hope to be shooting sometime in the new year.”  HBO ordered a pilot for the untitled prequel last month, with the action set thousands of years before the events of Game of Thrones. Per the official logline, “the series chronicles the world’s descent from the golden Age of Heroes into its darkest hour.

Years later, Brad regrets leaving the Friends star for his now-ex Angelina Jolie, a source told In Touch exclusively.  Following his 2016 separation from Angie, Brad sobered up and sought therapy. And now, he’s “in touch with emotions and his true self like never before,” the source says.  Brad Pitt finally opens up about his bitter divorce with Angelina Jolie  And it seems like this self-awareness comes with some great realisations. “He has come to realise that leaving Jen for Angelina was one of the biggest mistakes of his life,” the source adds. “And while he’s not in love with Jen, he realises how much he does love her. Brad keeps telling friends that he’s seeing everything more clearly.”  However, these realisations are obviously far too late. Jennifer has been married to Wanderlust co-star Justin Theroux for two years now.  And while Brad would “never dream of” ruining his ex’s new marriage, he “would take a second chance at love with Jen in a heartbeat.”  If they can’t be romantic partners, though, the War Machine star wants Jen to be his partner in other pursuits, In Touch further reported.  Brad Pitt “much happier” following split from Angelina Jolie  “They worked well together” when they formed the production company Plan B in 2001, an insider close to Brad told In Touch. “He wants Jen involved again as he produces and develops more and more high-quality film and cable TV products.”  That kind of professional partnership could pay off for Jen, too, since the insider states she wants in on “prestige projects” under his production banner. “She’d be beyond thrilled to win an Academy Award for Best Actress — something that’s evaded both her and Angelina.”  “He still considers Jen the love of his life,” the source concluded.

Following therapy sessions and intense self-reflection, the acclaimed actor, Brad Pitt, has come to a profound realization that Jennifer Aniston was, indeed, the love of his life.

In a stunning revelation, Pitt divulged this heartfelt revelation during a candid interview, providing a glimmer of hope for their dedicated fan base. The revelation comes after years of speculation regarding a potential reconciliation between the former Hollywood power couple.

Pitt, known for his charismatic on-screen presence, has long captivated audiences worldwide. However, it is his personal life that has often overshadowed his professional achievements, particularly since his highly publicized separation from Aniston fifteen years ago, which sent shockwaves through the entertainment industry.

Buoyed by months of introspection and intensive therapy, the actor delved deep into his emotions and realized the undeniable connection and love he shared with Aniston. This newfound clarity has set in motion a remarkable journey of self-discovery for Pitt, leading him back to the woman he once held so dear.

Though reluctant to elaborate on the specifics of his therapeutic experience, Pitt affirmed that the process had been transformative, allowing him to confront his own shortcomings and gain a renewed perspective on life. It was during this healing process that he began to comprehend the true significance of the bond he shared with Aniston.

Rekindling the romance with Aniston, however, might not be as straightforward as their die-hard fans hope. The Hollywood power couple, who were married for five years before calling it quits, have understandably moved on with their lives. Aniston, an accomplished actress herself, has found success both professionally and personally, while Pitt has had his fair share of high-profile relationships since their divorce.

Nevertheless, the news of Pitt's epiphany has ignited an immense flurry of anticipation among their admirers, who see the potential for a second chance at love. Social media is flooded with impassioned posts and hashtags calling for the couple's reunion, with fans rallying behind their shared history and undeniable chemistry.

As Hollywood's most sought-after couple, Pitt and Aniston have always been the focus of intense speculation, with tabloids often fueling rumors of secret meetings and clandestine encounters. This revelation by Pitt himself, however, adds an element of credibility and authenticity to the longing held by countless fans worldwide.

Only time will tell if Pitt's realization will lead to a rekindling of their romance. Hollywood, known for its unexpected twists and turns, is no stranger to reignited love stories. If fate sees fit to bring Pitt and Aniston back together, their reunion would undoubtedly be one for the ages, captivating an entire generation of hopeful romantics and redefining the notion of second chances."

Most of it deals with the repercussions of the storm which came before it, and for the first time in his career, the artist’s personality is overwhelming the art.  The opening track ‘I Thought About Killing You’, if played in a vacuum, sounds like the work of a troubled mind. If a poem like this came from a loved one, it would surely merit discussion about a trip to the therapist. Kanye goes on to deliver cringe-worthy rhymes on issues ranging from Russell Simmons rape allegations to his petrification on realizing that his daughter might one day look like his wife. He teases a few tidbits of The Old Kanye, chopping up beats from Slick Rick and The Edwin Hawkins Singers samples on ‘No Mistakes’, to keep his fans just interested enough. It’s telling that the one standout track, ‘Ghost Town’ is the track on which Kanye lurks in the background, devoting more time on production than on spoken word, and letting John Legend and Kid Cudi take over.  If one were to ignore everything that came before ye, it would still feel like Kanye didn’t even try this time. The usual meticulousness and perfectionism has apparently been supplanted by a Kanye shrug. The music is haphazard and hollow, mirroring the guy making it. Maybe he’s become blasé and doesn’t want to spend time on music anymore. He did say he wanted to run for President in 2020 (or 2024?) anyway.",1,en,"In the past, Kanye’s capriciousness has been repeatedly forgiven and, at times, belatedly rewarded with accolades. It is hard to imagine a My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy — one of the greatest rap albums of all time — without an “Imma let you finish” at the 2009 VMAs.","Title: Kanye West's Capriciousness: A Double-Edged Sword That Defines His Artistry 

In the realm of music, few figures have elicited as much fascination, controversy, and unyielding admiration as Kanye West. Indeed, over the course of his prolific career, Kanye's capriciousness has proven to be both a constant source of critique and the driving force behind his groundbreaking artistry. Now, as we reflect on the past, it becomes evident that his unpredictable nature wields a unique power, shaping his destiny with a dichotomy of forgiveness and triumph.

The indelible memory of the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards stands as a testament to this notion. A defining moment that will forever be etched in pop culture history, Kanye's impulsive interruption cannot be detached from the brilliance entwined within it. At the pinnacle of Taylor Swift's acceptance speech for ""Best Female Video,"" West's infamous ""Imma let you finish"" reverberated loudly, igniting a firestorm of fury and disbelief.

In the immediate aftermath, condemnations were swift and widespread. Many saw Kanye's actions as a flagrant display of arrogance, demanding a swift and decisive reckoning. However, as time would reveal, this incident marked a turning point not only for Kanye West but also for the narrative surrounding him. The world watched as a once-revered artist grappled with the negative fallout of his impetuousness.

Yet, as dawn follows darkness, redemption beckoned. With unwavering determination and a newfound sense of accountability, Ye channeled his passion and introspection into My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, an epoch-defining opus that transcended the boundaries of rap. Critics and fans alike soon recognized the album as a masterpiece, unanimously hailing it as one of the greatest in the genre's history. Its critical acclaim and commercial success owed much to the fervor and vulnerability that arose from Kanye West's tumultuous personal journey.

It is within this dichotomy—a driving force of capriciousness that leads both to momentary downfall and eventual triumph—that the essence of Kanye West lies. For every episode where he tests the boundaries of decorum and artistic convention, there is an equal and opposite reaction—an eruption of innovation and cultural significance that firmly asserts his creative genius.

To fully appreciate Kanye's contributions to music, we must embrace the complex tapestry of his capriciousness. By doing so, we allow ourselves to glimpse the artist who fearlessly navigates the boundaries of creativity, pushing against conventions and societal norms. It is precisely this amalgamation of traits that yields an output we cannot casually dismiss.

While it may be challenging to fathom My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy without the audacious interruption that catapulted Kanye West into infamy, we must recognize that it ultimately became a vital piece of the puzzle. Without his impulsive streak, without the trials and tribulations, the indomitable truth of one man's artistry would not have been realized.

So, as time moves forward, let us continue to grapple with the enigma that is Kanye West. Appreciating the totality of his journey, the highs and lows, allows us to understand the inexplicable and applaud the unruly genius that resides within him."

The No10 seed deflected a series of queries about the wrongful-death lawsuit filed on Thursday before she became overcome with emotion, prompting the moderator to request that journalists refrained from asking about the incident.  Venus Williams ‘at fault’ in fatal car crash, say Florida police Read more  “There are really no words to describe, like, how devastating and – yeah. I’m completely speechless. It’s just – yeah, I mean, I’m just …” a visibly shaken Williams said, her voice trailing off.  The seven-times major champion then broke down in tears, stepping out into the hallway to gather herself with members of her team.  Williams returned after about five minutes to field five more questions, mostly related to her 7-6 (7), 6-4 win against Belgium’s Elise Mertens amid wildly fluctuating weather on No1 Court, as the sun‑splashed afternoon gave way to blustery conditions and ultimately rain.  The American – at 37 the oldest woman in the draw here – was at her imperious best in the opening stages, breaking Mertens in her opening service game and dictating points with her serve. But Mertens, who was not born when Williams turned professional and only four when she won the first of her five Wimbledon singles titles, overcame those initial nerves and began challenging Williams with powerful groundstrokes into the corners and well-concealed variety.  Mertens blinked during the first-set tiebreak, then surrendered her early service break in the second. Rain interrupted play with the 21-year-old, who had just saved her second match point with a gorgeous backhand lob, serving at 3-5, 40-40 in the second set.  After a 33-minute delay Williams finished the job, uncorking an overhead smash to see off Mertens after an hour and 40 minutes and booking a second-round match against China’s Qiang Wang.  The American flashed her familiar smile after meeting her opponent at the net but it became clear during the press conference that her 20th appearance at the tournament she has won five times will be loaded with emotion.  “You can’t prepare for everything,” Williams said. “I have no idea what tomorrow will bring. That’s all I can say about it. That’s what I’ve learned.”  Palm Beach Gardens police said witnesses told investigators that Williams ran a red light in her Toyota Sequoia SUV at around 1pm on 9 June, injuring 79-year-old Jerome Barson, who died 13 days later. Barson was riding in the passenger seat when the Hyundai Accent driven by his wife, Linda, crashed into the side of Williams’s vehicle.  Williams told investigators she entered the six-lane intersection on a green light but was forced to stop midway through because of traffic ahead of her, failing to see the Barsons’ car when she continued through at about 5mph.  But police concluded the driver of Williams’s car “is at fault for violating the right of way”. Linda Barson, 68, also sustained injuries, including “a cracked sternum, shattered right arm, broken wrist, hand and fingers”.  Williams made her first public comments on the incident in a Facebook post on Friday night, describing herself as “heartbroken”.  One of only two former Wimbledon champions in the women’s field, Williams has a promising draw and perhaps a renewed ambition after her inspired run to the Australian Open final in January – a remarkable feat given the incurable autoimmune disease that has hamstrung her game for most of the decade.",0,en,0,"• American walks out of after media questions about Florida crash • Five-times champion beats Elise Mertens 7-6, 6-4 in first round  A tearful Venus Williams walked out of her press conference on Monday after her first-round victory at Wimbledon, the American’s first match since her involvement in a fatal car accident in Florida that police allege she caused.

(Introduction)
In a surprising turn of events, global pop icon Justin Bieber and supermodel Hailey Baldwin have reportedly become engaged after merely a month of dating, igniting a wave of speculation across the internet. This unexpected union has left fans and social media users questioning the couple's motive for rushing into holy matrimony, further propelling the seemingly unrelenting phenomenon that is Summer 2018.

(Body)
The young couple's engagement announcement echoes the trend of spontaneous love sweeping Hollywood during this sizzling summer season. A multitude of theories and guesses about the underlying rationale behind their haste have now emerged, capturing the imagination of both avid followers and casual observers.

Some skeptics argue that Bieber and Baldwin's engagement serves merely as a publicity stunt to maintain their relevance in the fiercely competitive entertainment industry. It is no secret that celebrity relationships often find their roots within strategic maneuvering to enhance their public image, and this particular narrative of a whirlwind romance undoubtedly fuels such hypotheses.

Others, however, choose to see their rapid commitment as a testament to the intensity and authenticity of their connection. The notion that true love transcends established conventions, including conventional timelines, garners support from those who believe that when the heart leads, reason must bow in respect.

Experts in the field of psychology suggest that Bieber and Baldwin may have succumbed to the unrelenting pressure of societal expectations. In an era where the pursuit of instant gratification is increasingly prevalent, individuals may find themselves caught up in the fervor of the moment, embracing life-changing decisions with greater haste than ever before. This cultural pressure, these analysts contend, influences even those occupying the upper echelons of fame, forcing them to adjust their pace accordingly.

Furthermore, Bieber's previous high-profile relationship with songstress Selena Gomez could have played a role in pushing the couple toward an accelerated commitment. Some speculate that Justin, having experienced the tumultuous ups and downs of a long-term relationship in the public eye, may now find solace in a situation that unfolds rapidly, leaving less room for scrutiny and potential heartache.

(Conclusion)
As Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin's controversial engagement continues to captivate audiences worldwide, the internet remains awash with conjecture over the motivations behind their expedited path to marriage. Whether driven by marketing strategies, a fierce desire for love, societal pressures, or past experiences, the answer remains elusive.

Summer 2018 seems relentless in its ability to generate sensational headlines and conjure unexpected unions. Amidst this rollercoaster of speculation, one thing remains clear: the news of Bieber and Baldwin's engagement will undoubtedly serve as fuel for debate and conversation throughout the imminent months, leaving both fans and critics eagerly awaiting the next twist in this captivating saga."

Since you've now called me a liar, I will now call you a silencer. I see your gaslight and now will raise you a scorched earth.  My friend Billy and I were at the Roxy on Sunset Boulevard seeing a band we loved. We decided to go to Mel's diner on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood to get burgers after. I had just gotten my driver's license and very specifically remember my nervousness trying to park in the diner parking lot. Upon leaving the restaurant we were stopped by you and your friend, who both seemed very nice. At one point you suggested we should all go to Las Vegas together. ""It's such a great place, have you ever been?"" You tried to make it sound innocent. This is something predatory men like to do, I've noticed. Make it sound innocent. Just a dollop of insinuation. Just a hair of persuasion. Just a pinch of suggestion. ""It will be so much fun, I promise you. Nothing has to happen, we will just have a good time together."" I told you my age, kindly and with no judgment or aggression. I told you my age because I thought you would be immediately horrified and take back your offer. You laughed and said, ""Even better. We'll have so much fun, I promise.""  Here's the thing, Mr. Woods. At that time I was not a public persona. I had done a couple years on a soap opera as an actress, but you wouldn't know me from Adam. I'm sure you've racked your brain trying to remember how you could've possibly hit on the actress Amber Tamblyn at a diner almost two decades ago. You think, it's not possible, there's no way I would've been so stupid as to hit on a 16-year-old known actress. But I wasn't known then, James. I was just a girl. And I'm going to wager that there have been many girls who were just girls or women who were just women who you've done this to because you can get away with it.  The saddest part of this story doesn't even concern me but concerns the universal woman's story. The nation's harmful narrative of disbelieving women first, above all else. Asking them to first corroborate or first give proof or first make sure we're not misremembering or first consider the consequences of speaking out or first let men give their side or first just let your sanity come last.

Upon leaving the restaurant we were stopped by you and your friend, who both seemed very nice. At one point you suggested we should all go to Las Vegas together. ""It's such a great place, have you ever been?"" You tried to make it sound innocent. This is something predatory men like to do, I've noticed. Make it sound innocent. Just a dollop of insinuation. Just a hair of persuasion. Just a pinch of suggestion. ""It will be so much fun, I promise you. Nothing has to happen, we will just have a good time together."" I told you my age, kindly and with no judgment or aggression. I told you my age because I thought you would be immediately horrified and take back your offer. You laughed and said, ""Even better. We'll have so much fun, I promise.""  Here's the thing, Mr. Woods. At that time I was not a public persona. I had done a couple years on a soap opera as an actress, but you wouldn't know me from Adam. I'm sure you've racked your brain trying to remember how you could've possibly hit on the actress Amber Tamblyn at a diner almost two decades ago. You think, it's not possible, there's no way I would've been so stupid as to hit on a 16-year-old known actress. But I wasn't known then, James. I was just a girl. And I'm going to wager that there have been many girls who were just girls or women who were just women who you've done this to because you can get away with it.  The saddest part of this story doesn't even concern me but concerns the universal woman's story. The nation's harmful narrative of disbelieving women first, above all else. Asking them to first corroborate or first give proof or first make sure we're not misremembering or first consider the consequences of speaking out or first let men give their side or first just let your sanity come last.  So it is with hope, Mr. Woods, that I ask you to go inward now and ask"

Introduced by The Chainsmokers, BTS made their U.S. television debut at the 2017 American Music Awards on Sunday, November 19th. BTS is taking the U.S over a landslide by being the first Korean Pop Boy Band to perform on a major American awards show.  BTS delivered their latest hit “DNA” with flashy choreography and enormous support from their A.R.M.Y. (a name given to their international fanbase) who accompanied them with chants throughout their performance. Tweets during and after their epic performance took over social media with the hashtag #BTSxAMAs. Fans, attendees and those new to the K-pop boy band fanbase obsessed over their amazing dance moves, voice control, red carpet fashion and physical aspect of the members of the boy band.  BTS (currently standing for ‘Behind the Scenes’) is a seven-member South Korean Pop Band formed by Big Hit Entertainment. While most boy bands in the U.S. have from three to five members in their groups, South Korean bands are internationally known for having more than 10 members in the band.  Jin, J-Hope, RM (known as Rap Monster), Suga, Jimin, V and Jungkook are taking over the world as BTS with their latest album “Love Yourself: Her” which has helped them become the highest charting K-pop group on the Billboard Hot 100.  Their performance at the 2017 AMA’s was highly anticipated by fans of the band when they announced it on social media. ’To call this guys International superstars honestly seems like an understatement’ said Drew Taggart from The Chainsmokers before the boys bounded on stage  During their performance, fans were not the only ones freaking out. Almost everyone, including celebrity guests like Ansel Elgort, was on their feet cheering and singing along with the band. Ansel even appeared to be recording the performance on his phone. “I need a moment to recover from that performance. That was incredible” said Jared Leto who joined the BTS mania and who was also left speechless after BTS’s performance.  It is safe to say that BTS has officially introduced K-pop to the U.S with their mind-blowing AMA’s performance which has left fans and those new to the concept of K-Pop wishing for more.

gossipcop-1716370499,"Dakota Johnson; most of us know her as the actress from Fifty Shades of Grey. While we may have seen Johnson in some pretty intimate positions on-screen, there’s definitely a lot we don’t know about the Fifty Shades star. Like, for instance, the superfluity of familiar names in her family tree. Seeing that her popular movie, Fifty Shades Darker came out on the day of love—Valentine's Day—it's only fitting to dedicate a piece to the actress who brought us the sexy and quaint, Anastasia Steele. Johnson, after all, has become somewhat something of a Valentine’s Day staple, herself. Here are 15 facts about Dakota Johnson or, as some might call her, ""that girl from Fifty Shades of Grey."" We guarantee that she will no longer by ""that girl"" by the end of the list! 15 Her Family Tree Is Full Of Famous Faces You know how we said there are a few familiar names in her family tree? Well, we weren’t lying. Her parents are fellow actors, Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson. Unfortunately, her parents divorced in 1994 so Dakota had to split her time between the two. ""It was the only way that I could be with them,"" she said in an interview for Cosmopolitan. ""And since they were divorced, I would spend two weeks with one and two weeks with the other, traveling with a tutor."" But wait, it gets better. Her maternal grandmother (can you guess..) is Hitchcock actress Tippi Hedren. Yes, that’s right, so clearly creative talent lies in that family. We’ve never heard of a family tree with so many famous names! Thanksgiving is probably a whirlwind. Now, Dakota Johnson is another famous name in that tree. 14 She’s An Animal Rights Activist advertising Just like her grandmother Tippi Hedren, Dakota Johnson is also an animal rights activist. Like grandmother, like granddaughter shall we say? As animal lovers ourselves, we’re pleased to hear that she’s following in her grandmother’s footsteps—both in acting and in animal rights. In 2014, Johnson saved 12 horses from being slaughtered by paying for them. What a sweet thing to do! We bet her grandmother was really proud. It’s always so great to hear about celebrities doing positive things - so naturally, we’re happy to hear of Dakota’s compassionate side. We admit we have a soft spot for animal lovers, but who doesn't? We always love hearing about people doing good deeds for animals and it’s always nice to hear celebrities using their celebrity title for the better. 13 She Grew Up Shooting Guns And Riding Horses In Colorado She may play the innocent and naive Anastasia Steele in the Fifty Shades movies, but growing up Johnson was anything but naive. She grew up in Colorado at her dad’s house, where she learned to build a fire, ride a horse, ride motorbikes, and even shoot a gun. And this was all before she was just 10 years old! Sounds like a badass kid to us! But when she wasn’t at her father’s house, she was at her mom’s house in L.A. which she also loved. It's hard to imagine a 10 year old these days shooting guns, riding motorbikes, or building fires without being grounded. But it sounds like she had a pretty inspiring and freeing childhood which makes us fall for the actress all the more. 12 She Never Dates advertising By the header, we mean she never has casual relationships. She only has long-term relationships. Good for her, is all we can say! You hear of so many celebrities who are constantly dating other celebrities. You can barely keep up with who they’re dating these days. It seems to be one guy or girl after another. So it’s great to hear of Dakota’s conservative views on relationships. Apparently she’s only ever been in long-term, serious relationships; she doesn’t just date. That probably explains why she’s been in a relationship with model Matthew Hitt since 2014. Yes, it’s been a kind of an on-and-off relationship but they’ve been in it for the long haul so far. So, to sum up, we like her whole dating attitude. The commitment is great and saves you a lot of time. 11 She HATED School It seems l",1,en,"Dakota Johnson; most of us know her as the actress from Fifty Shades of Grey.

She has tirelessly lent her voice and support to various charities, championing the rights of marginalized communities and advocating for gender equality. Her unwavering dedication to using her platform for the betterment of society has garnered her immense respect from both fans and industry colleagues alike.

As she continues to sculpt her career with diverse and thought-provoking roles, fans eagerly await the next chapter in Dakota Johnson's artistic journey. As her on-screen performances leave audiences yearning for more, it is the glimpse into her personal life and philanthropic endeavors that reminds us that there is always more than meets the eye when it comes to this captivating actress."

Mariah Carey's ""All I Want for Christmas Is You"" hits the Billboard Hot 100's top 10 at last, jingling from No. 11 (its prior peak) to No. 9 on the chart dated Dec. 30.

Plus, Migos, Nicki Minaj and Cardi B's ""MotorSport"" accelerates 15-6 for its first week in the top 10 following the premiere of its official video. As we do every Monday, let's run down the top 10 of the Hot 100, which blends all-genre streaming, airplay and sales data. All charts will update on Billboard.com tomorrow (Dec. 19). Let's start with a blizzard of chart stats about Carey's ""Christmas."" Streams, Sales & Plays: First, the numbers that result in ""Christmas"" (on Columbia/Legacy Records and co-written and co-produced by Carey and Walter Afanasieff) hitting the Hot 100's top 10. The song gains by 4 percent to 25.2 million U.S. streams in the week ending Dec. 14, according to Nielsen Music; dips 8 percent to 19,000 downloads sold in the same tracking span; and lifts 28 percent to 34 million in airplay audience in the week ending Dec. 17. Those totals place ""Christmas"" at No. 7 on the Streaming Songs chart, No. 13 on Digital Song Sales and No. 36 on Radio Songs. Notably, streaming is the most prominent driver of the song, accounting for 70 percent of its chart points this week. Carey's 28th Top 10: Carey collects her 28th Hot 100 top 10. ""Christmas"" is her first since ""Obsessed"" reached No. 7 in 2009. She tallied 19 top 10s in the 1990s and eight in the 2000s.

All the other acts above sent at least one song to the top 10 for the first time in each decade.)

gossipcop-871550,"Caitlyn Jenner proudly displayed her support for President Donald Trump on Thursday, August 3, just days after she slammed his “half-baked” transgender military ban.  The reality star, 67, was spotted wearing a red hat featuring the president’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan while driving around Malibu in a classic Triumph Spitfire sports car. She paired the look with a white polo shirt and mirrored sunglasses.  Jenner publicly supported Trump, 71, throughout the 2016 presidential election season, much to the dismay of her fellow transgender advocates on her short-lived E! series, I Am Cait. She later told CNN that she did not regret casting her vote for Trump, saying, “I don’t support him in everything that he does, but we needed to shake the system up.”  The Olympic gold medalist (formerly known as Bruce) reversed course in July after the real estate mogul announced on Twitter that transgender individuals will no longer be able to serve in the U.S. military “in any capacity.”  “There are 15,000 patriotic transgender Americans in the US military fighting for all of us,” Jenner tweeted on July 26. “What happened to your promise to fight for them?”  Caitlyn Jenner's Best Style Moments  The Secrets of My Life author later released a full statement on her website. “I believe every American should be outraged by the disrespect shown to those people wearing our country’s uniform,” she wrote. “Furthermore, this half-baked idea puts all of our service members in harm’s way. Does President Trump intend to just pull 15,000 people out of every critical position to which they are currently assigned? That would disrupt core military missions around the world and needlessly endanger our troops.”  Jenner concluded her blog post: “America’s 15,000 trans service members and 134,000 veterans are much braver than you, Mr. Trump; my allegiance is with them and our country, not you.”  For the latest celebrity entertainment, news and lifestyle videos, subscribe to Us Weekly’s YouTube Page.

gossipcop-867532,"With new Bachelorette Becca Kufrin waiting in the wings to find her true love, former Bachelorette Rachel Lindsay is out of the spotlight — that’s probably just how she wants it. She chose Miami-based doctor Bryan Abasolo at the end of her season, and the two walked into the sunset together during the 2017 finale. But, as we know, relationships founded on The Bachelor and The Bachelorette can have, let’s say, short shelf lives. Bachelorette stars Rachel and Bryan still together in 2018?  Rachel took to television in 2017 with the dream of finding a man. And she found two! It came down to Bryan and Wisconsin-based personal trainer Peter Kraus. The finale was tough to watch, as Peter and Rachel seemed like a better match to many fans but Peter wasn’t convinced that he could be engaged after knowing someone for, like, six weeks (imagine that). That didn’t fly with Rachel, and the two had a really emotional breakup, one that Rachel thinks overshadowed the fact that she found longtime love with Bryan.  “I wish you were able to really see more of Bryan. [The breakup with Peter] really did overshadow, I felt, a happy moment for us, like one of the best moments of my life,” Rachel told Us Weekly. “I’ve never been engaged before and neither has Bryan, and I felt like we were more on the defense about our relationship and having to explain more of it than rather it just showing … So I just wish you really got to see Bryan, and I hate that it took away from him.”  And, for the record, Peter and Rachel do not talk. “For me, the reason there was so much emotion [in the finale] was because that was closure for me, that was it,” Rachel told Us Weekly. “And I really haven’t talked to him because I don’t have anything else to say. From what I hear, he’s doing well too.”  Peter is doing well, and you know what? Rachel and Bryan are, too! The pair is still together, living in Dallas (Bryan relocated from Miami) and being just a regular, everyday Bachelor Nation couple. (They also still have Copper, Rachel’s dog, which is very important.)  The number-one question that a Bachelor couple gets after getting engaged on national television is, “When are you getting married?” At least Rachel and Bryan have an answer. As Bryan told ExtraTV, “We haven’t set anything yet. We definitely want to get married this year, and that’s the plan. 2018, it’s gonna happen.” He explained that even though Rachel “isn’t much of a planner,” the nuptials would happen soon, and they may even be on television. “We would definitely be open to a televised wedding. We, right now, we enjoy showing everybody how in love we are... and I think that would be the culmination of our love story, or the beginning of it,” Bryan said. “I think we would definitely enjoy doing it on national television.”  I would also enjoy have a huge wedding paid for by ABC, so why not? In another interview with Us Weekly, Rachel said she needed a few things of the pair’s impending nuptials. “Good music.

I feel like flowers add character to the wedding, so that’s a must-have. No roses. We’re done. Those days are over.”  No roses is probably a good idea — she could go into muscle memory and just start handing them out.

gossipcop-884410,"“Vegas is a funny town,” said Jimmy Kimmel during his emotional opening monologue for Jimmy Kimmel Live on Monday night. “It’s easy to forget people live there.”  The late-night host would know: Kimmel is a Vegas native himself, having moved there from Brooklyn when he was 9. So when he launched into his introduction to Monday night’s show, just one day after a shooter, 64-year-old Stephen Paddock of Mesquite, Nevada, opened fire on a crowd of concertgoers outside Las Vegas’s Mandalay Bay Hotel, the news was particularly poignant. James Corden, Trevor Noah , Stephen Colbert , and Seth Meyers all, like Kimmel, devoted their opening monologues to discussing the shooting in Las Vegas.  But Kimmel, who has recently found a calling transforming his show into a political conscience (even though, as he said Monday night, “I want this to be a comedy show. I hate talking about stuff like this”), began tearing up as soon as the cameras started rolling, giving a particularly unfiltered perspective on gun control and the government’s continuing inaction in the face of mass shootings.  “It’s the kind of thing that makes you want to throw up or give up,” he said. “It’s too much to process.” He offered a scathing indictment of both the president, who offered his “warmest condolences” on Twitter while having signed a bill in February that allowed mentally ill individuals easier access to purchasing guns, as well as of the 56 senators who voted against closing a loophole that allows prospective gun buyers to evade the government-mandated background checks, showing their faces on screen and describing them as those “who won’t do anything about this because the NRA has their balls in a money clip.” For in the wake of various incidents of gun violence—Sandy Hook, Charleston, Orlando, now Las Vegas—the National Rifle Association has successfully lobbied in favor of second-amendment rights: “Our forefathers wanted us to have AK-47s, is the argument,” Kimmel said, incredulous.  Politicians’ inaction—and their widespread reluctance to turn mass shootings into mobilizing efforts in favor of stricter gun control—was the subject of the monologues of Kimmel’s peers, too. As Corden, whose voice also tightened as he delivered a quiet, measured speech, said, “Some say it’s too early to talk about gun control; for those victims last night, it’s far too late.” He, like Noah, is a recent New York transplant who has witnessed the two worst mass shootings since the mid-20th century in the past two years: First, at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida last summer; and now, in Las Vegas, Nevada.  “It should be hard for everyone to fathom,” Corden said. “Gun violence should not be a staple of American life.”  And yet the response to these shootings—of which there have been 275 so far in 2017—has become rote. “People are becoming more accustomed to this kind of news. I almost know how it’s going to play out,” Noah said during The Daily Show on Monday night, a sentiment Meyers echoed opening Late Night With Seth Meyers . “We’re shocked, we’re sad, thoughts and prayers, and then, almost on cue, people are going to come out and say, whatever you do, when you speak about the shooting, don’t talk about guns,” Meyers said.  It’s not just that politicians have refused to pass gun control legislation that, as Stephen Colbert pointed out, “the vast majority of Americans want.” Later this week, a bill that would make it easier for individuals to purchase gun silencers—which, as Politico reported, currently have more stringent requirements for purchase than guns themselves —was expected to go up for a vote in the House of Representatives. However, Sunday night’s shooting is expected to delay the bill to some degree—for, at least, if elected leaders refuse to “politicize” an incident of gun violence as a way of promoting gun control, the converse is also true, that they will also be reluctant to promote gun (and gun accessory) access.

gossipcop-9811720113,"I, at least, struggle to understand her career. Her performance as a junkie in “The Town” features the “Bride Wars” of Boston accents. Her performance in “The Age of Adaline” — as a woman “cursed” to stay 30 forever — was like watching a mermaid ride a bike. She tries. But her acting hasn’t yet caught up to her algorithm-generated beauty. Alas, there may be no algorithmic solution for that.  So I was less than psyched at the prospect of seeing her shiver on a buoy, stitch her own wounds, talk to animals or play a Nancy. And, as refreshing as it is watching her stand on a surfboard, it’s refreshment that provides some perspective. While some actors make sense on movie screens, there are others who might make better sense on a can of something — beer, beans, air. I can hear you, Hudson skeptics. And all I can say is that the heart wants what the heart wants. I’d actually buy whatever Ms. Hudson was on the can of.  There might be no appreciable industrial difference between what a Kate Hudson can do versus your Blake Livelys. I don’t think they’re interchangeable, but sometimes the movies beg to differ, and the market corrects itself. Don’t fall in love with Mark Harmon, because here comes Kevin Costner. And sell your Brad Rowe stock, because he’s just going to be replaced by Brad Pitt. (In the late 1990s, that pretty much happened.) But there are continuums, too. Channing Tatum, for instance, is a more elastic, hip-hop-era Brendan Fraser upgrade.  Lots of parts that have gone to Ms. Lively feel as if Ms. Hudson could have played them. But something happened, and suddenly it was someone else’s turn to be “it.” (It’s always someone else’s turn.) And part of what annoys me about the lack of Kate Hudson in my life and the surfeit of Ms. Lively is the same thing that makes me angry when a perfectly good piece of software gets a superfluous update, or a zealous waiter takes my plate at a restaurant: I wasn’t done with that.",1,en,"I, at least, struggle to understand her career. Her performance as a junkie in “The Town” features the “Bride Wars” of Boston accents.","Title: Jennifer Lawrence's Career Puzzles Audiences: A Struggle to Comprehend Her Performance in “The Town”

In what can only be described as a perplexing twist, Jennifer Lawrence's enigmatic career continues to bewilder avid moviegoers. The recent release of her portrayal as a junkie in the critically acclaimed crime drama, “The Town,” has left audiences grappling with the jarring juxtaposition of her performance against the backdrop of her previous work, specifically her role in the comedy ""Bride Wars."" 

Lawrence, a talented actress known for her versatility and ability to seamlessly immerse herself into diverse characters, has found herself the subject of scrutiny. As viewers eagerly anticipated her latest cinematic venture, they were met with an unanticipated challenge in understanding Lawrence's interpretation of her character's accent in the crime-filled streets of Boston.

Since her breakout role in the independent film ""Winter's Bone,"" Lawrence has built a reputation for delivering compelling performances that captivate audiences. Her innate ability to embody complex characters has earned her accolades and widespread acclaim. However, juxtaposing her previous work with her portrayal of a junkie in “The Town,” presents a disconcerting puzzle for fans and critics alike.

""The Town,"" directed by Ben Affleck, delves into the raw underbelly of criminal activity in Boston. Critics have praised the film's gripping narrative and its portrayal of gritty, authentic characters. Lawrence's inclusion, therefore, seemed promising, given her proven track record of delivering sublime performances. However, it is her attempt at capturing the distinct, nuanced Boston accent that garners attention and, at times, bemusement.

The film's setting demands an authentic portrayal of the local dialect, and Lawrence exhibits commendable commitment to master the signature accent. However, while her approach may be commendable, critics have voiced concerns over her execution, suggesting that her interpretation veers uncomfortably close to caricature. 

Lawrence's prior work, particularly her role in the lighthearted comedy ""Bride Wars,"" showcases her remarkable range. The stark contrast between the two films leaves viewers grappling to reconcile the disparate performances, struggling to find a through-line in Lawrence's career trajectory.

Given Lawrence's undeniable talent and on-screen charisma, it is undeniable that her career choices are part of a deliberate strategy to challenge herself as an actress. It would be remiss to dismiss her performance outright without recognizing the risk she takes in pushing the boundaries of her craft.

Lawrence's portrayal as a junkie in “The Town” unquestionably pushes the envelope, testing her acting prowess and her ability to immerse herself in vastly different roles. However, it remains a matter of subjective interpretation whether her attempt at the Boston accent hinders or enriches her performance.

As audiences continue to navigate the enigma that is Jennifer Lawrence's captivating career, it is the subtle perplexities she presents that further solidify her position as a formidable force in the world of cinema. With a burning passion for pushing artistic boundaries and defying audience expectations, Lawrence's trajectory remains as fascinating as it is challenging to fully comprehend."

When model Tati Neves, 26, was asked if she kissed the Baby singer , she coyly answered: ""What do you think, if I was sleeping in the bedroom, just me and him?""  That really clears it up then.  Before the interview on Brazilian TV the model allegedly told friends she saw Bieber smoke weed and spent the night with him.  On Globo TV's Fantastico she was asked if she saw a bevy of girls arrive at 3am the same night, believed to bussed in from a nearby club, she replied: ""No. So, I'd already gone into the bedroom with him.""  She also claimed she had taken the video of Bieber asleep, with his beloved baseball cap nearby, the following morning after waking up first.  (Image: Youtube)  She said: ""I was sleeping, and woke up, he was sleeping and I was speaking with a girlfriend.""  Tati, who appears naked on some adult Brazilian websites, is thought to have met Bieber in the Centaurus club in Rio which is notorious for being a brothel.  But Marcus Mion, the owner of the Zax Club in the Barra da Tijuca neighborhood, disputed the model's account.  He said Ms Neves wasn't among the 30 girls the singer chose to go back with him to his rented villa.  (Image: Youtube)  He said: ""I know all the girls who went. I personally went round asking inviting them on behalf of Justin, and I put each one in the van that took them there.""  Two girls were pictured leaving the club with Bieber, although his aides insist he thought it was a private members’ club.  Bieber has now left Brazil and is in Argentina on the South America leg of his world tour.  He has been asked to leave the Hotel Faena in Buenoa Aires because his fans were destroying property and barricade walls put up for his arrival.  On Sunday he said Argentina was “crazy” and told the fans there he loved them after Saturday’s gig.  3am has contacted Bieber for a comment.",1,en,"Get daily updates directly to your inbox Subscribe See our privacy notice Thank you for subscribing!

gossipcop-6722352082,"Carlotta is a fictional character from Gaston Leroux's 1909 novel The Phantom of the Opera.  In the novel, she is a minor character hailing from Spain. The first time that she is mentioned in the novel is during the chapter ""The New Marguerite"", where it is revealed that she could not perform at the ceremony for the former managers. Later in the novel, she is threatened by Erik that if she performs at the Opera House ""a great misfortune will strike"". She shrugs the warning off and performs anyway. When she does, however, croaking noises come out of her mouth and the chandelier comes crashing down. Ashamed, she hides from the public view for a few weeks, before making a return to the opera house.  Carlotta is portrayed by Virginia Pearson in the original 1925 silent film with Lon Chaney. In 1929, new sound scenes were filmed and Mary Fabian was recast as Carlotta, due to the fact that she could sing. Virginia Pearson still appeared in new scenes, now playing Carlotta's mother. These changes are also the same in the 1929 silent, foreign cut of the film (which is most commonly viewed).  In the 1943 film version, she is Mme. Biancarolli who has been drugged by the Phantom and murdered along with her maid when she tries to force him to take off his prop mask.  In Andrew Lloyd Webber's production, Carlotta (last name Giudicelli) is from Italy and is one of the major singing parts. The opera company's prima donna, she despises Christine Daaé and sees the younger woman as a threat to her job and Phantom´s courtesan, when Christine achieves prominence due to the Phantom's dirty tricks. Carlotta and tenor Ubaldo Piangi are lovers; she often turns to him for consolation when things go wrong, and she breaks down crying when his murdered body is discovered onstage. The film reveals that she likes poodles.  In the Lloyd Webber-Joel Schumacher 2004 film version, she was played by Minnie Driver.[1] Due to Driver's lack of experience in opera, her singing voice was dubbed by opera singer Margaret Preece, although she lent her actual voice to the song ""Learn to Be Lonely"" during the end credits.  In Nicholas Meyer's novel The Canary Trainer, the characters of Carlotta and La Sorelli are combined into one, despite being mentioned as separate characters in the original novel. In Kim Newman's short story ""Angels of Music"" from the Tales of the Shadowmen anthology series, Carlotta is implied to be the ancestor of Bianca Castafiore from The Adventures of Tintin comic series.",1,en,"Carlotta is a fictional character from Gaston Leroux's 1909 novel The Phantom of the Opera. In the novel, she is a minor character hailing from Spain.","Headline: The Enigmatic Carlotta: A Noteworthy Figure in Gaston Leroux's Masterpiece

In Gaston Leroux's renowned literary work, The Phantom of the Opera, the captivating tale unfolds in nineteenth-century Paris, chronicling the extraordinary events surrounding the world-famous Opera Garnier. Amidst the labyrinthine corridors and shadowy corners of this iconic institution, readers are introduced to the enigmatic Carlotta, a fictional character who leaves an indelible mark in the hearts and minds of those immersed in Leroux's masterful narrative.

Carlotta, a minor character originating from the sun-kissed lands of Spain, emerges as a vibrant and multifaceted figure amidst the backdrop of lavish performances and backstage intrigues. Though her role may seem modest at first glance, Carlotta's presence is pivotal in encapsulating the essence of Leroux's tale and further enriching its grandeur.

Throughout the novel, Carlotta's grace, unparalleled vocal prowess, and commanding stage presence become undeniable. As a celebrated prima donna in the fabled opera house, she captivates audiences night after night, becoming a cherished and familiar face among the devoted patrons. Underneath the glitz and glamour, however, lies a complexity that intertwines with the central plot.

While The Phantom of the Opera primarily revolves around the mysterious ""Opera Ghost,"" the novel's eponymous character, Carlotta's proximity to this enigmatic being is not to be overlooked. The lyrical diva becomes unwittingly intertwined in the specter's elaborate schemes, discovering a side of the opera house hitherto veiled in secrecy. Her encounters with the Phantom carry an air of tension, adding further layers of suspense and intrigue to the overall narrative.

Furthermore, Carlotta serves as an embodiment of the vivid cultural tapestry that enriches Leroux's masterpiece. Hailing from Spain, her captivating beauty and foreign allure captivate the Parisian audiences, merits that earned her the highest praise amidst the demanding world of opera. Leroux expertly weaves this cultural distinction into the fabric of the novel, crafting a nuanced character that unravels the essence of diversity within a setting governed by tradition.

While Carlotta may appear as a minor character on the surface, the impact she leaves on readers' minds is undeniable. Leroux's careful characterization and intricate portrayal elevate her beyond a simple theatrical performer, bridging the gap between the fantastical and the real. In their collective imagination, readers witness not only the Phantom's haunting presence but also the echoes of Carlotta's voice reverberating through the dimly lit corridors of the Opera Garnier.

The memory of Carlotta, forever crystallized within the pages of Gaston Leroux's 1909 novel, continues to intrigue and fascinate audiences worldwide. Her alluring presence, hailing from the depths of Spain, stands as a testament to the power of literary creation and its ability to evoke emotions that transcend time and place."
gossipcop-178000221,"Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge wasn’t always a royal, but even before her marriage to Prince William, Kate Middleton had an impressive net worth.  Middleton had a comfortable upbringing before she became the first commoner to join the royal family after she married William in 2011. But Middleton’s net worth ballooned once she became a duchess.  Here’s everything we know about Middleton’s net worth:  What is Kate Middleton’s net worth?  The 36 year-old mother of three — who gave birth to a second baby boy in April — is worth at least £5 million, or $7 million, according to global wealth-tracking firm Wealth-X, though some estimates put her net worth as high as £7.3 million, or $10 million. Middleton’s wealth is mostly in cash because she doesn’t have a personal portfolio of property or artwork.  That being said, Middleton’s net worth is a lot less than her prince — Wealth-X estimates Prince William’s net worth is at least $30 million, though some reports put his fortune closer to $40 million. According to Wealth-X, $19 million of Prince William’s wealth is in cash. The wealth tracking firm also noted that William has an expensive helicopter fit for a royal — an Augusta A109S Grand helicopter which is valued at $11 million.  Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, Prince George of Cambridge and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge arrive for a children's party for Military families during the Royal Tour of Canada on September 29, 2016 in Victoria, Canada. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  What do we know about Kate Middleton’s money?  Most of Middleton’s net worth stems from Party Pieces, an online party supplies business started by her parents. The company is estimated to be worth around £30 million, or $50 million, thanks in no small part to the exposure it gets from being associated with the royals, according to royal expert Marlene Koenig.  Prior to her life as a full-time duchess, Middleton worked for the family business and was a part-time accessories buyer for a retailer called Jigsaw.  Growing up, Kate and her two siblings, Pippa and James Middleton, attended expensive privates schools from a young age, with years of tuition for just one child estimated to be at least £250,000, or $350,000. Kate met Prince William while in college in Scotland at the prestigious University of St. Andrew’s. She graduated in 2005 with a degree in Art History.  How did Kate Middleton’s net worth change after marrying Prince William?  Joining the royal family meant that Middleton was marrying into an incredible $88 billion fortune amassed over generations.  Before Will and Kate became the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and moved into a 20-room apartment in Kensington Palace, Kate lived in an apartment purchased by her parents in the Chelsea neighborhood of London believed to be worth £1 million, or $1.4 million.  Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge smile following their marriage at Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011 in London, England. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  But once Kate officially became a royal she didn’t need to spend much of her own money anymore. Most of her living costs are covered by the private estate Prince Charles manages, the Duchy of Cornwall. The revenue from the Duchy of Cornwall pays for the most of Prince Charles and his family’s royal expenses: things like official travel, wardrobe, housing and staff costs. When Meghan Markle marries Prince Harry on May 19, she too, will get to keep most of her own money — her net worth is believed to be about $5 million — as the Duchy of Cornwall will also absorb the majority of her living costs associated with royal responsibilities.  What is the ‘Kate effect’?  As the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate sets fashion trends all over the world. While she herself does not retain any income from the flurry of economic activity set off by the designer clothes she wears for public appearances, she has triggered what is known as “the Kate Effect,” ",1,en,"Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge wasn’t always a royal, but even before her marriage to Prince William, Kate Middleton had an impressive net worth.","Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, previously known as Kate Middleton, has emerged as a prominent figure in the British royal family. While her marriage to Prince William catapulted her into the spotlight, it is worth noting that the Duchess had already amassed an impressive net worth before joining the esteemed ranks of royalty.

Prior to her marriage, Kate Middleton's financial standing was evidence of her unwavering determination and entrepreneurial spirit. Hailing from Berkshire, England, Kate, a woman of immense grace and poise, steadily built her own wealth through astute business ventures and diligent career choices.

The Duchess's journey towards financial success began during her university years at St. Andrews, where she pursued a degree in Art History. During this time, Kate exhibited her innate ability to balance her academic obligations with a dedication to financial independence.

Through her shrewd awareness of market trends, Kate recognized the burgeoning potential of the fashion industry. Emboldened by her deep passion for design and style, she explored various opportunities, thereby catalyzing her ascent to financial prosperity. Acting as a trendsetter herself, the Duchess ardently pursued a series of entrepreneurial activities that set her net worth on an upward trajectory.

While the specifics of her net worth remain private, it is a testament to her savvy business acumen that Kate succeeded in acquiring considerable assets independently. Her unwavering commitment and dedication to her own financial growth highlights the Duchess's determination in carving her own path long before joining the royal family.

Today, as Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, stands by Prince William's side, she embodies grace, sophistication, and unwavering dedication towards the betterment of the British monarchy and society as a whole. The Duchess's impressive net worth serves as a reminder that behind her regal title lies a woman of substance, integrity, and outstanding prowess in both personal and professional realms.

As the Duchess continually captivates the world with her elegance and compassion, it is important to celebrate her achievements beyond her association with the crown. Kate Middleton's ability to amass an admirable net worth, even before her illustrious royal marriage, showcases her as an inspiring role model, empowering countless individuals to pursue their dreams and cultivate financial success."

It's not an appropriate question to ask a trans person.""  But nothing else was off-limits, as Sawyer caught up with Jenner nearly two years after the TV journalist had done their last emotional interview. Then, the ex-athlete stunned the world by revealing how he had lived a lie. Inside, ex-decathlon champ Jenner had always identified as a woman.  Since then, Jenner said she has been ""happy, peaceful…all of that confusion has left me….I did the right thing"" -- and doesn't miss ""Bruce"" a bit.  Sporting red nails and stylishly feminine clothing, Jenner recalled how—when he was still known as Bruce--he had put an instruction in his will: ""When I'm buried, I want to be dressed as her 'cause that's the way I'm going to heaven.""  As many know from her former reality show, ""I Am Cait,"" Jenner is a Republican and she confided to Sawyer, ""Yes, I did vote for Trump.""

But Jenner got upset when President Trump's administration revoked the federal guidelines that allowed public school students to use bathrooms corresponding to their gender identity--believing it's an issue best left to state and local authorities to decide.  ""It was extremely disappointing…you mess with my community, you don't give us equality and a fair shot, I'm coming after you,"" Jenner sighed about President Trump's decision.  Although Jenner has had her jawline, forehead, and breasts worked on, she insists she's always been a woman because what's important is ""what's between your ears.""

While the specific details related to Caitlyn Jenner's historic ""final surgery"" weren't immediately disclosed, it is a momentous event that marks a significant milestone in her personal transformation. The procedure itself is a personal and deeply intimate decision that varies for each individual, and the choice to reveal these private details demonstrates Jenner's desire to bring attention to the complexities of transgender journeys and destigmatize discussions surrounding gender confirmation surgery.

In recent years, increased visibility for the transgender community has sparked essential conversations surrounding gender identity, paving the way for more inclusive and compassionate dialogue. Caitlyn Jenner's willingness to share her experience openly will undoubtedly contribute to these ongoing discussions, promoting empathy, understanding, and acceptance.

As we move forward, it is my hope that Caitlyn Jenner's announcement will serve as a catalyst for broader public discourse surrounding transgender issues, leading to improved support systems for transgender individuals and their unique experiences. It is through empathy, education, and a commitment to inclusivity that we can create a world where everyone can express their authentic selves freely and without fear of judgment.

Caitlyn Jenner's gender reassignment journey is an extraordinary testament to her courage, resilience, and unwavering commitment to personal truth. Her disclosure of undergoing ""the final surgery"" propels her advocacy work to new heights, and we can only anticipate the positive impact her story will continue to have on the lives of individuals within and beyond the transgender community."

The singer is looking out for her girl, Khloe Kardashian, and wants her to know she’s risking ‘serious heartbreak’ trusting Tristan Thompson with his ex. Read on for all the EXCLUSIVE details.  Iggy Azalea, 26, knows a lot about heartbreak when it comes to dealing with men. Especially, those who are still connected to their exes. That said, The New Classic artist is trying to get word to Khloe Kardashian, 32, that Tristan Thompson, 25, may break her heart if she’s not careful.  “Iggy’s not trying to be salty or hate on Tristan but she’s hit up French [Montana], and told her he needs to put Khloe up on game and warn her that she’s putting herself at risk for serious heartbreak with him,” a source close to Iggy told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “Iggy explained to French that these basketball players are no joke and don’t care whose heart they break in their quest to bang every girl that breathes.”  “Iggy still feels some type of way after Nick [Young] cheated on her and then on top of that got his baby mama pregnant – again,” the source continued. “She’s sticking to the girl code and would hate for Khloe to experience the same type of pain she did. She’s hoping French gets to her before it’s too late.”  As HollywoodLife.com previously reported, it’s really hard for KoKo to ignore the rumors that TT and his baby mama, Jordy Craig, are still hooking up. In fact, we’re told Khloe’s hired some private eyes to keep tabs on her dude. “She loves Tristan wholeheartedly and he’s been nothing but a stand-up, loving man,” another source told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “But she can’t help but worry sometimes. Khloe spends as much time in Cleveland as possible and has spies in every city his team plays in.”  HollywoodLifers, do you think Khloe will listen to Iggy?",1,en,"International Women’s Day may have passed, but that’s not stopping Iggy Azalea from keeping its memory alive.

Publication: International Affairs Daily

Byline: [Journalist's Name]

International Women’s Day may have passed, but that’s not stopping Iggy Azalea from keeping its memory alive. The popular singer has taken it upon herself to act as a concerned friend, advising Khloe Kardashian to tread cautiously in her renewed relationship with Tristan Thompson, warning of the potential for ""serious heartbreak"" caused by his reconnection with his former partner.

Amidst the glitz and glamour of Hollywood relationships, it is difficult to overlook the intricate dynamics that come into play. Iggy Azalea, known for her candidness, has publicly expressed her concerns for Kardashian, the renowned reality television star, via social media. Azalea, a prominent advocate for women's empowerment, is calling into question the decision to trust Thompson once again.

Thompson's notorious infidelity scandal caused a media frenzy just a few years ago, shaking Kardashian's world and simultaneously capturing the public's attention. Now, as the basketball player seems to be rekindling his romance with an ex-partner, Azalea has emerged as a staunch supporter of Kardashian, urging her to consider the potential consequences of such a decision.

The rap artist's fear stems from the all-too-familiar tales of heartbreak and trust shattered in relationships – a sentiment that resonates with many women around the world. Azalea's message not only emphasizes her concern for Kardashian's emotional wellbeing but also highlights the underlying issues faced by women in relationships today.

Azalea's public plea to Kardashian is founded on her belief that acknowledging past behavior is essential when contemplating the future. The Grammy-nominated musician asserts that Thompson's past indiscretions could potentially pose a significant risk to Kardashian's happiness and emotional stability.

With her newfound role as a friend and mentor, Azalea recognizes the importance of women supporting one another amidst the complexities of modern relationships. International Women's Day may be over, but its spirit lingers for those who continue to champion gender equality and encourage women to make well-informed choices.

Azalea's words serve as a reminder that in an era where the world is still battling gender inequality, it is the responsibility of every woman to empower and protect one another. As Azalea goes above and beyond to ensure Kardashian's well-being, her actions epitomize the sense of solidarity that International Women's Day aims to foster.

While the future remains uncertain for Khloe Kardashian and Tristan Thompson, Iggy Azalea's intervention serves as an inspiration for women globally. It encourages them to honor and celebrate International Women’s Day beyond its official date, actively embodying its core values throughout the year. As the specter of serious heartbreak looms, Kardashian must now weigh these concerns against her own desires, finding a balance between trust and self-preservation.

In a world where trust can be fragile and love can be complicated, Azalea's stance offers a powerful message to women everywhere: question, observe, and protect your hearts, even when International Women’s Day is no longer in the headlines."

gossipcop-845755,"It’s rare to find me without my curls smoothed, twisted by a curling iron into beach waves , and misted with texture spray. I love to have my hair done. A trip to the local blow-dry bar is my favorite Saturday afternoon pastime. However, at $50 a session, getting this look done by professionals on the regular is costly. So I’ve perfected my own blowout skills. It may seem like an easy task: grab a blow-dryer, point, and blast with heat. But there is a mastery behind it. And you may be making simple mistakes that are actually hurting your hair even more than your look. Here, top pros break down the science to getting a gorgeous at-home blowout every single time and point out all the rookie mistakes that keep them in business. 1. You don’t have a great blow-dryer. Let’s start at the very beginning: Investing in a high-quality tool is important, especially if you have a lot of hair or you’re blow-drying your hair often. “If you have thick hair, you’re probably damaging your hair more with a cheap blow-dryer as opposed to investing in a great one that will protect your hair and blow-dry it quicker,” Kérastase celebrity stylist Jennifer Yepez tells SELF. Expensive dryers tend to come with hair-saving smart features like high power, multiple heat settings, a cool shot, and ionic air technology. The last one helps with frizz, creates shine, and minimizes blow-dry time. “The technology in ionic hair dryers helps break down water molecules faster, which makes the hair dry faster,” she adds. The less time your hair is under heat and the more control you have over the temperature, the healthier it will be. Yepez’s favorites are the new T3 Cura Luxe ($250) and the Dyson Supersonic ($399). Expensive? Yes, but you’ll pay for it in what you save skipping just five to 10 blowouts at the salon—and they’ll last you years. 2. You’re spending too long with your hair wrapped in a towel. “After getting out of the shower, women tend to leave their hair in the towel for like 30 minutes,” says Giovanni Vaccaro, Glasmsquad’s creative director. “A cotton-based towel causes friction on the hair, and it's more prone to damaging the strands to the point where the hair breaks off,” he explains. If you want to get rid of excess water, Vaccaro recommends using a microfiber towel like the Aquis or an old, clean t-shirt. And still, only spend about 10 minutes with your head wrapped up post-shampoo. The best thing for your hair’s health is actually letting it air-dry before blow-drying. “Hair is in its most vulnerable state when wet, so allowing it to air-dry is always the healthiest option,” explains Vaccaro. Make sure to dry your hair according to your texture. Vaccaro says that fine-to-medium hair can air-dry a bit longer, to about 80 percent dryness, whereas thicker hair should only be about 50 percent dry before blow-drying. That’s because you have a better chance of getting curly or full hair straight while it’s still a little damp. If you have curly or wavy hair and want to enhance your natural texture, add product when it’s very wet, squeeze out the excess with your hands, and wrap it up gently in a microfiber towel or t-shirt. Once your curls stop dripping, you can start blow-drying. 3. You start in with the brush too soon. On the opposite side of the 30-minute towel turban faux paus is taking a round brush to sopping wet hair. It’s bad form to immediately walk out of the shower and pick up your blow-dryer and round brush for a blowout. T3 celebrity stylist David Lopez suggests using a dryer to rough dry hair first. Set it to medium heat and low speed. “If hair is very wet and put on high speed, then it gets whipped around a lot,” he says. “This can cause split ends, tangles, and frizz.” Once hair is about 80 percent dry from the rough dry, then you can start sectioning it, molding it, and styling it with a round brush. 4.

You forget to spray heat protectant on the back of your head. Using the right product pre-blowout is going to save your ends from breakage and make your blowout last longer. But make sure you’re applying it correctly. “When some people use a serum for frizzy hair or a thickening spray for volume, they just spray the top of their hair, instead of all around,” says Yepez. “Sometimes you just forget the back of your hair.” She advises parting the hair, creating sections, and working the product from mid-shaft to ends. You can also comb it through, but Yepez says she’s often in a hurry and just uses her fingers. 5. You ignore the concentrator nozzle attachment. You know that flat, nozzle thing that attaches to the end of your hair dryer? Don’t lose it! That little nozzle helps concentrate the air in a more precise way and protect hair from excess heat, which is better for hair health and styling. “A nozzle is a must for a smooth finish!” Vaccaro adds. “The nozzle provides distance between the hair and the lip of the dryer, which is the hottest point. Additionally, the nozzle keeps the air flow concentrated, and without it, the hot air disperses, causing undesirable frizz.” Even if you’re not going for a sleek style, it is important to attach the nozzle—no matter how lazy you feel. “If you're just a ‘rough dry and go’ girl, you should still utilize the smoothing capabilities of the concentrator,” Lopez says. “It helps streamline the airflow leading to less tangles and split ends.” That means fewer haircuts, ladies.

gossipcop-892144,"Actress Kristina Cohen claims the sexual assault occurred in February 2014.  Actress Kristina Cohen has accused Gossip Girl actor Ed Westwick of rape. The television star has denied the claim, saying that he does not know the accuser.  Cohen — who posted the claim on Facebook with details of her emotional state over the past month during the flood of sexual misconduct stories in Hollywood (she called the outpouring ""both triggering and emotionally exhausting"") — alleges that Westwick sexually assaulted her three years ago, in February 2014, during ""a dark time in my life."" Her mother was sick with cancer (she died three months after the alleged assault) and she did not have the support system to deal with ""the aftermath of the rape.""  Reached by The Hollywood Reporter on Monday night, Cohen detailed the claims she made in her Facebook post. Her sister, Catalina Colgate, and close friend, Blaise Godbe Lipman, separately corroborated that they were told of Cohen's account three years ago, when the sexual assault was alleged to have taken place.  Westwick responded in a statement on Instagram that read, ""I do not know this woman. I have never forced myself in any manner, on any woman. I certainly have never committed rape.""  The incident allegedly occurred at Westwick's home in the Hollywood Hills. Cohen said she had been invited to the actor's home by a producer named Kaine Harling, a man she had briefly dated in 2013. The evening took a turn, she claims, when ""Ed suggested 'we should all fuck.'"" Despite wanting to leave, Cohen said she was encouraged to stay for another 20 minutes by Harling ""to smooth everything over"" while Westwick suggested she nap in a guest bedroom.  After falling asleep, Cohen alleges that she woke up to Westwick assaulting her.  ""I was woken up abruptly by Ed on top of me, his fingers entering my body. I told him to stop, but he was strong. I fought him off as hard as I could but he grabbed my face in his hands, shaking me, telling me he wanted to fuck me,"" Cohen alleges. ""I was paralyzed, terrified. I couldn’t speak, I could no longer move. He held me down and raped me.""  Shocked and confused, Cohen said she ended up leaving the next morning. ""I was so lost and needed someone to pull me out of there,"" she told THR, adding that Harling had left earlier in the night.  Cohen told her friend Lipman of the encounter and also spoke with Harling, whom she claims blamed her for what happened. She added that Harling told her ""I can’t say anything because Ed will have people come after me, destroy me, and that I could forget about an acting career. Saying there’s no way I can go around saying Ed 'raped' me and that I don’t want to be 'that girl.'""  Cohen continued that she now realizes ""the ways in which these men in power prey on women, and how this tactic is used so frequently in our industry, and surely, in many others."" THR reached out to Harling for comment, but he has yet to respond.  Seeing the flood of stories about everyone from Harvey Weinstein and James Toback to Kevin Spacey and Brett Ratner inspired Cohen to share her story of the alleged incident. Cohen, who is from Atlanta, is an actress, writer and producer whose credits include the series Ladies Like Us and the upcoming film Earthwalkers.  ""There is a bigger picture to this — cleaning out the system and creating radical change,"" Cohen told THR. ""I think that's what I'm contributing to.

We’ve got the pics of their steamy Mexican getaway  Rihanna has kept her one year romance with Saudi billionaire Hassan Jameel super private. So when rumors surfaced in June that they had broken up fans were waiting to see proof they were still a couple. They got it on July 9 when pics surfaced of the 30-year-old singer and the businessman on a sexy Mexican getaway. The two appeared to be locked in a animated conversation as bikini clad RiRi is seen pointing her right index finger in the air with her mouth open, looking like she had something important to say. In another pic Hassan is seen looking back at her with his hand on his chest as if they’re involved in a somewhat heated conversation. CLICK HERE to see all the pics.  On June 1 MediaTakeOut claimed RiRi had dumped Hassan. The site reported that “Rihanna just got tired of him. She gets tired of men sometimes,” an alleged insider told them. They said that the handsome billionaire wasn’t doing too well after the split. “Of course Rihanna broke his heart. That’s what she does — break men’s hearts.” Since Rihanna has never commented on her romance with Hassan and goes to great lengths to keep their relationship away from the public eye, MTO’s report spread like wildfire.  Obviously something is still on between Rihanna and Hassan, as they are having a hot summer together. They were first photographed a year ago making out in a pool in Spain. They’ve only been pictured a handful of times since, keeping their love undercover. The “Work” singer’s previous relationship was with Drake, 31, and it played out in public. He even professed his years of love to her in front of the world while presenting her with the Video Vanguard award at the 2016 VMAs. After having the public know all about their dating business, Ri has wisely kept her romance with Hassan as far out of the public eye as possible.  Rihanna revealed recently that Drake gushing about her on live TV made her cringe. In a May 2018 interview with Vogue, she said “Waiting through that speech was probably the most uncomfortable part. I don’t like too many compliments; I don’t like to be put on blast.” As for where she stands with Drizzy, she told the mag that they haven’t spoken and that “We don’t have a friendship now, but we’re not enemies either. It is what it is.” However she did come the close to discussing her relationship with Hassan, telling the publication that she dating and she is happy. “I used to feel guilty about taking personal time,” she revealed, “but I also think I never met someone who was worth it before,” she said about her romance with Hassan.",1,en,"Despite rumors of a split, Rihanna is still very much together with boyfriend of one year Hassan Jameel.

gossipcop-6909849467,"Now, it’s official: Star Wars fans will have one final chance to say goodbye to Carrie Fisher, with Lucasfilm announcing that the actress, who died in December 2016, will appear in next year’s Star Wars: Episode IX.  In a statement, director J.J. Abrams sought to put concerns about potential CGI resurrections to rest, saying that the new movie will use “unseen footage we shot together in Episode VII” and assuring fans that “we were never going to recast, or use a CG character.” While this is, undoubtedly, comforting, it would also appear to offer particular clues about the role Fisher — or, more specifically, her character, Leia Organa — will play in the movie.  Firstly: Purely for practical purposes, Leia’s presence in the movie will be small. If nothing else, there can’t be that much extraneous, unseen footage from 2015's Star Wars: The Force Awakens; she was barely in that movie, so unless large swaths of scenes were shot but never even hinted at by anyone involved in the production, there’s limited material to draw from in the first place, and surely not everything available will be used.  Considering the context of the footage, it also limits the potential use for Episode IX. Leia appeared in few scenes and locations in The Force Awakens. Leia was on Takodana, rescuing Han, Chewbacca, Rey and Finn, and then at the Resistance base on D’Qar, where she takes part in planning, and later monitoring, the attack on Starkiller Base. Aside from brief interludes with Han and, later, Rey, she’s very much in “harried leader” mode throughout the movie. Does this mean that this is the Leia we’ll see in Episode IX, even after losing her ex-husband, and then her brother, in the previous two movies?  (It’s possible that the Fisher footage will end up being just a minor flashback, used to punctuate a contemporary moment; memories during her funeral, as some on social media have already suggested. If so, then the above problem is side-stepped, to a degree.)  Abrams’ comments leave space for some level of postproduction trickery to be applied to the Fisher footage. Presumably, Fisher will be intercut with new footage of actors shot specifically for Episode IX. Will digital trickery be used to make sure that Fisher shares a location with the other cast members? If so, will that be all that’s altered? What about costuming choices? For that matter, what about the potential for posthumous dubbing or soundalikes used for dialogue where Leia is off-camera or not in close-up? Abrams said that the movie would never use a CG character, but what about a performance augmented or altered by CG?  Of course, if any such edits or alterations are made, they’ll have to be done with subtlety and sensitivity. This is key to the entire enterprise of including footage of Fisher posthumously. For as much as fans want to be able to say goodbye to the actress, and also to Leia, they want to do so in a manner that feels appropriate and respectful to both. While Abrams and Lucasfilm — and Fisher’s family, especially daughter Billie Lourd, named in Abrams’ statement — want to provide both closure and tribute to Leia and Fisher alike with this move, they’re courting backlash if this isn’t done perfectly.  That the footage will come from The Force Awakens feels particularly fitting, then; that, after all, was a project that already came with expectations and looming accusations from fandom expecting the worst. It’s also perhaps a reminder that those involved with this move love the mythology — and loved Fisher as a person — as much as anyone else, if not more so, and will be approaching it with the utmost care.  Everyone will, inevitably, remain worried until the final product appears onscreen, but perhaps we can rest just slightly in the meantime.",1,en,"Now, it’s official: Star Wars fans will have one final chance to say goodbye to Carrie Fisher, with Lucasfilm announcing that the actress, who died in December 2016, will appear in next year’s Star Wars: Episode IX.","In a bittersweet revelation, Lucasfilm, the renowned production company behind the legendary Star Wars franchise, has officially announced that devoted fans will be granted a final opportunity to bid farewell to the indomitable Carrie Fisher.

Carrie Fisher, internationally recognized for her portrayal of the iconic Princess Leia Organa, left an indelible mark on the hearts of millions across the globe. Her unexpected passing left not only the Star Wars community, but also the wider film industry, mourning the loss of an uncompromising talent.

The revelation underscores the profound respect and unwavering dedication that Fisher's legacy continues to command, ensuring her narrative journey remains intact, and her character's story reaches a fitting conclusion.

Details regarding the extent of Fisher's involvement and the manner in which her character will be included in Episode IX have been kept under a veil of secrecy. The studio, recognizing the sensitivity of this decision, has undoubtedly undertaken a meticulous and heartfelt approach to ensure Fisher's inclusion is executed with utmost reverence.

Undoubtedly, this long-awaited reunion with the beloved Princess Leia Organa will elicit a rollercoaster of emotions from Star Wars enthusiasts. It is a poignant triumph for fans who admired Fisher not only for her on-screen charisma but also her candid, unapologetic personality.

A slew of superhero television shows, including The Defenders, The Tick, Inhumans, Runaways, and The Punisher, have recently debuted or are set to debut later this year, joining the ranks of existing series like Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Legion, Arrow, Supergirl, The Flash, and Marvel’s ever-growing stable of Netflix series. The thought of adding another entry to such a crowded docket feels more like a taunt than a treat. But somehow, despite the ongoing deluge of capes and cowls, one new series this fall is poised to make you want more superhero shows just like it. It’s The Gifted, which debuted earlier this month on Fox. The show — a drama set in the X-Men’s mutant universe where the X-Men might not exist and anti-mutant sentiment is high— is an on-the-run thriller with a big, bad government that wants to hunt down these special humans. Each episode of the show’s young first season (three episodes have aired so far) has been equal parts mutant melodrama and family soap opera, with savvy and relatively impressive special effects. (Television superhero shows aren’t exactly well-known for their dazzle.) But the best thing about the show is how well it translates and stays true to the heart of the X-Men. The Gifted, like all the best X-Men stories, understands that the X-Men aren’t celebrity superheroes The Gifted’s premise is divided into two main plots. The first plot involves a ragtag group of mutants on the run from the government. John Proudstar, a.k.a. Thunderbird (Blair Redford), is a mutant with superhuman agility and strength with superhuman senses. He leads a group whose core members include teleporter Clarice Fong, a.k.a. Blink (Jamie Chung); mistress of magnetism Lorna Dane, a.k.a. Polaris (Emma Dumont); and photon-manipulating Marcos Diaz a.k.a. Eclipse (Sean Teale). The team’s main objective is to house and protect mutants who are on the run. The second plot centers on the Strucker family, an initially normal-seeming bunch headed up by dad Reed (Stephen Moyer) and mom Caitlin (Kate) (Amy Acker). However, the Struckers’ lives become anything but ordinary when siblings Lauren (Natalie Alyn Lind) and Andy (Percy Hynes White) find out they’re mutants. These two stories collide when Kate and Andy experience their mutant awakenings in the show’s first episode and seek help from Thunderbird’s mutant underground railroad. The twist is that their father, Reed, works a prosecutor who specializes in jailing mutants, making a living by detailing the threats that mutants present to society. And he had no idea his children were mutants. In each episode, there’s tension not just between mutants and the various members of the Strucker family, but also with Reed’s conscience and whether he’ll turn on the people helping his family, in order to cut a deal with the government in hopes it’ll spare his family. Since the X-Men aren’t present in this world, in the public’s eye, all mutants, even if they’re not displaying mutant powers, are dangerous. And this bleak view of humanity and its warts are what makes The Gifted’s premise such a strong addition to the X-Men universe. Thunderbird’s team knows just how bad humans can be.

If you take that away, then they are no different than any other team.” This idea is key to The Gifted. The reason it feels so different from many other superhero shows stems from the role that fear plays in its story; no one is saving the day in one fell swoop. And even though there are acts of heroism — like Thunderbird and Eclipse rescuing the Struckers in the third episode — any small miracles that would otherwise inspire hope and optimism are swallowed up by the relentlessness and influence of a government that’s intent on rounding up and getting rid of mutants. It’s compelling because it’s not a superhero story, but rather a survival story about beings who happen to have superpowers. But the show also smartly tweaks the classic X-Men story by changing its point of view In addition to capturing the fear and loathing of the X-universe, The Gifted incorporates a lot of other classic X-Men elements: Family — both the one you’re born into and the one you choose — is a major theme. So is the question of who helps the helpless. Villains are omnipresent and constantly spying, as the government’s Sentinel program sees and hears almost everything. When you look at major X-Men stories like God Loves, Man Kills or the crossover event known as The Mutant Massacre, they involve the deaths of innocent people who’ve been marginalized by society. In God Loves, Man Kills, two innocent mutant children are slaughtered by religious zealots. In The Mutant Massacre, a group of mutants shunned by society are living in sewers, where a group of villains named the Marauders kill them. It’s up to the X-Men, who themselves are hated by society, to help these marginalized groups. Those"

The talk show host on Sunday posted a photo on Instagram of him and his wife boarding a private jet.  “Vacation time is here, let’s go girl,” he captioned the Sunday, July 8 image.  The photo, which was similar to one Marjorie posted on her Instagram Story, got praise from fans.  “God bless….. stay focus[ed] don’t [lose] the vision🙏💍.”  “Enjoy yourselves, you guys deserve this vacation. Come back well rested and a stronger bond and marriage. Yahoo for the Harveys.”  Days earlier, RadarOnline reported that Marjorie walked out on Steve because he had been getting close with Kris Jenner during closed-door business meetings and ongoing phone calls and text messages.  “There was a huge blowout fight and Marjorie walked out threatening divorce,” a source told the gossip site of the reported split. “There’s no way she was going to put up with Steve hanging around a man-eater like Kris — especially since he’s proven time and again he can’t be trusted.”  Although Jenner was reportedly just stringing Steve along to get tips on TV success, one of his former talk show employes said Marjorie knows her man, who is twice divorced and cheated on both wives with the next.  “Steve has a wandering eye and he loves women!” the ex-worker told Radar anonymously. “He’s cheated during his previous marriages, and Marjorie knows he could do it again. She knows her man’s weakness — knows everything about him! That’s why she watches him so closely.”  The rumor was the talk of Twitter.  “Am I late?? Did everyone know Steve Harvey is being accused of cheating on Marjorie with Kris Jenner?! I didn’t know this 😂.”  “Steve Harvey left his wife to marry Marjorie, his side b—- of 20 years, and now she’s leaving him and running his pockets. Hilarious.

During an unspecified occasion, the esteemed actor seized the opportunity to express his perspectives on prevailing social matters, elevating the discourse with his unwavering wisdom and genuine concern for societal well-being.

At a time when Hollywood celebrities' opinions are often relegated to the realm of frivolity, Denzel Washington's candid remarks demonstrate a profound understanding of the imminent challenges we face as a global community. Drawing attention to crucial issues that intersect our daily lives, his words bear highlighting due to their rarity within a sphere that often promotes glamour over substance.

Washington's ability to transcend his celebrity status and delve into the depths of societal complexities is a testament to his unwavering integrity.

gossipcop-8854037683,"Titanic II is set to launch in less than two years — not in movie theaters, but on the open sea.  A replica of the world’s most famous “unsinkable” ship — which struck an iceberg and sank on its maiden voyage on April 15, 1912, killing 1,503 people — is under construction, with a maiden voyage planned for 2018.  Australian tycoon and politician Clive Palmer — not J. Bruce Ismay — is at the helm of the ambitious project to faithfully recreate the luxury ship, which will be about 13 feet wider to meet current regulations.  More importantly, it will carry enough lifeboats for every passenger and its hull will be welded, not riveted, just in case it comes across a rogue iceberg, the Belfast Telegraph reports.  “The new Titanic will of course have modern evacuation procedures, satellite controls, digital navigation and radar systems and all those things you’d expect on a 21st-century ship,” James McDonald, global marketing director of Palmer’s company, Blue Star Line, told the paper.  The new nine-deck ship will be 885 feet long, about two more than her doomed predecessor, 174 feet high and have a maximum speed of 24 knots. She will accommodate 2,400 passengers — 177 more than the RMS Titanic.  It also will feature the same categories of passengers — from the first-class movers and shakers to the hoi polloi in third class, where poor Leonardo DiCaprio was berthed in the classic movie.  Unlike the Belfast-built original, the Titanic II is under construction by the CSC Jinling Shipyard in Jiangsu, China.  Its maiden voyage will not be from Southampton to New York, but rather from Jiangsu, China, to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, the paper reported.  Some of the dead passengers’ relatives have criticized the plans for a new Titanic, but Blue Star has reportedly been flooded with requests for tickets — with some offering up to about $900,000 for a spot on the first trip.",1,en,"Titanic II is set to launch in less than two years — not in movie theaters, but on the open sea.","Titanic II is poised to become a reality in less than two years, promising a truly unprecedented experience that will transport travelers back in time to the glamorous era of the original Titanic – not through cinema, but on the vast expanse of the open sea. Amidst anticipation and excitement, the renowned Australian billionaire, Clive Palmer, has revealed his ambitious undertaking: replicating the iconic ship that met a tragic fate over a century ago.

This audacious project, spearheaded by the Blue Star Line company, aims to resurrect the grandeur and elegance of the legendary Titanic, ensuring every detail closely resembles the grand vessel that captivated the world. With construction well underway, Titanic II will be a testimony to human engineering achievements, incorporating the latest technology and adhering to modern safety standards. The vessel will replicate the intricate interior, exterior, and aesthetics of its predecessor, while also embracing contemporary advancements.

The decision to breathe life into Titanic II was born from the profound appreciation and admiration for the original ocean liner's mystique and historical significance. Titanic, despite its tragic legacy, remains an enduring symbol of opulence, unity, and endurance. The grandeur and allure associated with its name continue to captivate the collective imagination of people worldwide.

Although critics have initially expressed skepticism over the endeavor, Palmer, an entrepreneur known for his resolve and unparalleled ambition, remains steadfast in his commitment to bring this monumental project to completion. The launch of Titanic II aims to accurately replicate the maiden voyage of the original vessel, which embarked on its ill-fated journey in 1912.

As we approach the launch date, Titanic II is garnering immense interest from individuals longing to embark on a unique voyage that intertwines history, luxury, and formidable maritime engineering. The carefully recreated vessel will provide passengers with an opportunity to experience the luxuries defined by the Edwardian era, offering an unrivaled insight into the lavish lifestyle of a bygone era.

Although Titanic II's primary objective is to deliver a truly immersive and authentic experience, the utmost priority is the safety and comfort of its passengers. Cutting-edge maritime technology, state-of-the-art safety measures, and advanced navigation systems will be installed to ensure the most secure and enjoyable journey possible. The ship's crew will undergo rigorous training, adopting the highest industry standards and implementing emergency response protocols.

With the maiden voyage set to embark in just under two years, Titanic II intends to honor the memory of the original vessel, its passengers, and crew while instilling a sense of awe and wonder in all those who seek to board this magnificent recreate. The voyage will provide an unparalleled opportunity for a select few to savor the romance of a bygone era while traversing the world's most captivating seas.

As Titanic II sets sail, it will undoubtedly become a floating tribute to the immeasurable human spirit, immortalizing the bravery, sacrifice, and strength of those who experienced the tragedy that still echoes in the annals of history. This veritable floating time capsule will pay homage to the original Titanic, ensuring its legacy endures with an undying spirit, forever evoking emotions ranging from profound respect to newfound curiosity."

gossipcop-902467,"ATLANTIC CITY, NJ — Trashed by emails sent by pageant officials, former Miss Americas may help choose the new leaders of the Miss America Organization.  The group told The Associated Press Wednesday night that it is seeking the help of former Miss Americas and state directors to recommend the next generation of leaders for the pageant.  In emails that were published last week by the Huffington Post, pageant officials ridiculed the appearance, intellect and sex lives of former Miss Americas. The emails included one that used a vulgar term for female genitalia to refer to past Miss America winners, one that wished that a particular former Miss America had died and others that speculated about how many sex partners former Miss America Mallory Hagan has had.  The ensuing uproar led to the group’s executive director, Sam Haskell; its president, Josh Randle; board chairwoman Lynn Weidner, and one other board member to resign.  Dan Meyers, the group’s interim board chairman, said the group wants former Miss Americas and state directors to recommend members for a search committee that would determine the organization’s leadership structure, and choose individuals to fill those roles.  “The board wanted to have a process that was unprecedented in terms of openness, transparency and inclusion,” he said. “Given the turbulent nature of leadership transitions, asking all the stakeholders to be a part of this process was the best way.”  Some past winners reacted negatively to the board’s statement, saying the board had not reached out to them about help in selecting new leaders. Others said they wanted no involvement whatsoever by any current board members in seeking new leadership.  see also Miss America execs resign after disgusting emails surface There they go — a series of vulgar e-mails has...  “At this time all remaining members must step aside so we can take our beloved program back,” Miss America 1977 Dorothy Benham told the AP. “They have underestimated the strength, intelligence, and determination of the women who have worn the Miss America crown, as well as every young woman who is currently wearing, or has worn the local and state crown. We stand united.”  Jennifer Vaden Barth, a former Miss North Carolina, said the former winners want a completely new board to search for leaders, not one that supported Haskell.  “The board needs to accept responsibility for the damage they have caused,” she told the AP late Wednesday. “They need to step aside quickly and allow new leadership to save the Miss America program.”  Under the plan, former Miss Americas and state directors collectively would name four people to the search committee, and the board would name a former state title holder to the panel. These five individuals and two board members “will begin their exhaustive search in a matter of days,” a statement from the board read.  There are currently two vacancies on the 14-member board, and there will be at least two more when the resignations of Randle and Weidner become effective in a matter of weeks.

I really do, I swear to God on my life I want you to be happy.” Bethenny Frankel and Ramona Singer Bravo So where does Frankel and Singer’s friendship stand now? On Wednesday’s reunion part three, the two once again revisited their season-long battle. And after exchanging another round of blows, they appeared to settle back into a truce — even hugging at the end. “The thing was all season, I just wanted you to be out of my way,” Frankel told Singer. “I’m not angry at you — I knew you had such anxiety coming in here. I don’t feel anger towards you. But do I need to be your best friend? No.” “I don’t want to be close, but I don’t not not like you is where I am with you,” she said, quoting Singer’s iconic “I don’t not not like you” from earlier in the season. “I’m not angry with you, I honestly wish you happiness.” Her words resonated with Singer. “I feel it from you. I’m honestly happy we’re in this place. I really feel better,” she said, as host Andy Cohen pointed out the two weren’t in that good of a place. “At least [Bethenny’s] talking to me. She’s not icing me out. So for me, that’s good!” Bethenny Frankel and Ramona Singer Bravo Singer spent a lot of time Wednesday apologizing for her actions — even admitting that she “cringed” when she watched back some of her arguments with the upcoming Shark Tank investor. “It was blind range,” she said of her behavior in the Berkshires. “I was so angry, it was blind range.” She was also blind drunk too. “I had a few too many,” Singer admitted, balking down questions from Cohen that she was also on pills. “I wasn’t on pills, I was just drinking all day because being around her was making me nervous. I don’t take Xanax.” “Looking back, I looked like an a——. I don’t know what I was thinking the whole damn season,” Singer added. “I just lost my whole mojo for weeks on end because Bethenny was so upset with me — which I can understand in retrospect. But I just didn’t know how to make it right and it just got worse. And it was just a horrible moment in my life.” Ramona Singer, Sonja Morgan, Dorinda Medley and Luann D'Agostino Bravo Still, despite “owning” her bad behavior, Singer remained steadfast that her original question about Frankel’s naked-film past was innocent. “My delivery sucked at that lunch. [But] it was not coming out of viciousness, it was not coming out of maliciousness,” Singer said, explaining that she had been sent the article from a friend a week before talking with Frankel about it. “My first concern in the back of my head was remembering that [former New York City Housewife] Alex McCord had a naked picture in one of the weeklies [in season 1],” Singer recalled. “And [my daughter Avery’s] school was upset, she was almost asked to leave. … I was like, ‘Oh my God, I hope everything’s okay with Bryn. I hope no one’s saying anything.’ “ Bethenny Frankel, Andy Cohen, and Ramona Singer Bravo FROM PEN: Andy Cohen’s Pick For The Most Absurd Real Housewives’ Business Ever Frankel didn’t buy it. “The article brought up something that had already been in the press years ago and I wrote in a book had come out six weeks before,” she told Singer. “So when you came to that very intimate"

gossipcop-8581615474,"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired.
