Zayn Mailk and model Sofia Jamora are at it again in his latest music video for “Entertainer.” In it, Sofia is seen rocking a blonde wig, which gives her more Kylie Jenner vibes than Gigi Hadid, but she’s in the dressing room of a strip club while Zayn walks the streets smoking a cig.

The Houghster may have nabbed his sixth Mirrorball trophy, but it was his partnership with Bindi that undoubtedly made it his favorite season.

Dancing With the Stars is coming back for its 22nd season, featuring the return of Len Goodman, Bindi Irwin as the reigning champion, and the exciting news of a baby for Allison Holker. Before we get to the new season, let's take a look back at everything that happened after the finale. After being declared the winners of season 21, Bindi Irwin and Derek Hough were still in shock, with Bindi exclaiming, ""I think I'm going to scream for 20 minutes!"". Their friendship and partnership was evident throughout the season, with Derek even considering Bindi as a sister. In fact, he's planning a trip to Australia to experience her world. Although he has won the Mirrorball trophy six times, Derek said this was his favorite season and wouldn't change a thing. Bindi is eager to return to her wildlife conservation work in Australia. While Sharna Burgess and Nick Carter were disappointed not to win, they praised Bindi and Derek for their amazing journey. Nick has his solo album and a movie coming up, while Sharna plans to be Nick's wing woman on tour. Alek Skarlatos is looking forward to the DWTS Tour and his simple pleasure of eating. Allison Holker, despite being six months pregnant, was full of energy and happy to be dancing on the show. She's preparing for her first Thanksgiving and the arrival of her baby, which she'll reveal the gender of on social media. The return of Len Goodman as a judge next season was a big announcement backstage, and the pros were excited to have him back. Mark Ballas hopes to have his girlfriend compete on the show, although he joked that she might be assigned to Derek instead. Overall, it was a night filled with amazing performances and heartfelt moments."

And no one’s been on the receiving end of that criticism more than Taylor Swift. Despite a lengthy catalogue of hits in which she plays scorned exes and lovelorn balladeers, the country singer turned pop superstar has been seen less as a victim than as a purveyor of victimhood, using her prodigious songwriting talents and natural affability to become a megaphone for perceived injustice. So what does Taylor Swift do to prove to us she’s aware of this narrative (the one, of course, from which she’d like to be excluded)? Acid gossip that borrows from better songs – Taylor Swift: Look What You Made Me Do review Read more Release a music video – for her new single, Look What You Made Me Do – that’s practically boiling over with meta-commentary and self-referential detail, from an ongoing visual snake motif to a tombstone that literally reads “Taylor Swift’s reputation”. Yes, it’s painfully on-the-nose, but Swift’s brand hasn’t exactly been built on subtlety. Look What You Made Me Do – or LWYMMD, as its Twitter hashtag dictates – is well on its way to smashing streaming records, but the song hasn’t been as well received by critics. Continuing in the tradition of her last album, 1989, which marked Swift’s official evolution into pop music behemoth, it largely abandons that which made her a household name – singable melodies; sharp, specific lyricism; grand tales of romantic enchantment – in favor of radio-engineered pop and glib proclamations of vengeance. Near the end of the song, she answers a phone call; someone’s asking to speak with Taylor Swift. “She can’t come to the phone right now,” Swift 2.0 says. Why? “Because she’s dead.” In the battle between Swifts, my allegiance is with the deceased version, a shrewd chronicler of young-adult courtship and seasoned, starry-eyed songwriter. So much so that hearing her new single made me nostalgic for the days of Fearless and Red. But the Old Swift be damned; this new one is all about retribution and, as the title of her forthcoming album suggests, reputation. The music video for LWYMMD, which premiered during Sunday night’s VMAs, sees Swift double down on her vengeful streak, making theatre of her scandal-laden career in an attempt to communicate a self-awareness that’s mostly eluded her. The video is good fun, if a little bit mad; it’s certainly the most brazen and ambitious pop music video since Beyoncé dropped Lemonade in the spring of last year, replete with pyrotechnics and dozens of costume changes. But it doesn’t amount to much more than a succession of disconnected images. And if the images could talk, they might say, “I know what you think of me”, or, perhaps, in the words of Joanne the Scammer: “I’m a messy bitch who lives for drama.” But still, in all those images, Swift left a lot to be decoded. A connoisseur of the tongue-in-cheek (remember the capitalized letters in her lyric booklets that spelled out clues about a song’s subject?), it begins with a zombified T-Swift digging her own grave. Get it? The Old Swift is dead, dunzo, kaput, resigned to the graveyard of pop culture history. First, we see the aforementioned tombstone, where Swift’s reputation lies, but also a second one, reading “Nils Sjoberg”, the pseudonym Swift used as a co-writer on her ex-boyfriend Calvin Harris’s song, This Is What You Came For, a collaboration widely assumed to have contributed to their breakup. Swift’s writing credit was supposed to be kept secret, but when her team revealed that she had, in fact, written the Harris-Rihanna hit, her ex went on a tweetstorm about how Swift was looking for “someone new to try and bury”. So she buried the fictitious Mr Sjoberg.

So much so that hearing her new single made me nostalgic for the days of Fearless and Red. But the Old Swift be damned; this new one is all about retribution and, as the title of her forthcoming album suggests, reputation. The music video for LWYMMD, which premiered during Sunday night’s VMAs, sees Swift double down on her vengeful streak, making theatre of her scandal-laden career in an attempt to communicate a self-awareness that’s mostly eluded her. The video is good fun, if a little bit mad; it’s certainly the most brazen and ambitious pop music video since Beyoncé dropped Lemonade in the spring of last year, replete with pyrotechnics and dozens of costume changes. But it doesn’t amount to much more than a succession of disconnected images. And if the images could talk, they might say, “I know what you think of me”, or, perhaps, in the words of Joanne the Scammer: “I’m a messy bitch who lives for drama.” But still, in all those images, Swift left a lot to be decoded. A connoisseur of the tongue-in-cheek (remember the capitalized letters in her lyric booklets that spelled out clues about a song’s subject?), it begins with a zombified T-Swift digging her own grave. Get it? The Old Swift is dead, dunzo, kaput, resigned to the graveyard of pop culture history. First, we see the aforementioned tombstone, where Swift’s reputation lies, but also a second one, reading “Nils Sjoberg”, the pseudonym Swift used as a co-writer on her ex-boyfriend Calvin Harris’s song, This Is What You Came For, a collaboration widely assumed to have contributed to their breakup. Swift’s writing credit was supposed to be kept secret, but when her team revealed that she had, in fact, written the Harris-Rihanna hit, her ex went on a tweetstorm about how Swift was looking for “someone new to try and bury”. So she buried the fictitious Mr Sjoberg. In the next shot, Swift luxuriates in a tub of diamonds, where there sits a single dollar bill, a possible reference to the symbolic dollar she earned in last month’s sexual assault case against the radio DJ who groped her in 2013. Internet conspiracists, too, ran with this as a visual reference to Melania Trump, who could be seen forking diamond necklaces like spaghetti in a Vanity Fair spread last year. But those were the same people insistent that Swift, who kept mum during last year’s presidential campaigns, is a closeted Trump supporter. That the election coincided with Swift’s period of self-imposed exile did little to get her back in the public’s good graces; but diamonds, unlike gilded toilet seats, do not a Trump reference make. This next one is a dead giveaway: Swift sits atop a throne as dozens of snakes slither at her feet. One even serves her what we can only assume is piping hot tea, the kind Kim Kardashian dished out when she released audio of Swift, who publicly disputed Kanye West’s lyric about her in Famous, appearing to sign off on those same lyrics in a phone conversation with West. Afterwards, Swift’s reputation as a snake in sheep’s clothing took off; Kardashian helped further that image by tweeting a bunch of snake emojis on international snake day. More than a year later, it seems Swift’s ready to embrace the title: ahead of the single’s release, she dropped cryptic reptilian teaser videos. And now, the snake has shed her skin. There’s also an inscription on Swift’s gold throne that reads “Et Tu Brute”, the Latin phrase used in William Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar when Caesar is being assassinated by his friend Brutus. It’s a far cry from the Swift of yesteryear, whose Shakespeare references were more Romeo and Juliet than Julius Caesar. But she’s dead, remember? It was at the 2016 Grammys, when 1989 beat Kendrick Lamar’s To Pimp a Butterfly for album of the year, that Swift first began to truly test the public’s patience. That was also where she publicly rebuked West’s"

Part of the change in tone is down to the passage of time and to how much Britain, or perhaps the royal family, has changed in the last few years. Another reason, of course, is that Harry, being the second son and not a future king, has the freedom to be more relaxed, less constrained by tradition, and less conventional than his brother. This wedding has nothing to do with dynasty, or ensuring the security of the royal line. (We hope they have kids! But only because it’s fun to have kids, not because it would be some sort of international crisis if they did not.) This wedding had everything to do with two people who are totally into each other and wanted to have a great big happy celebration. Oprah, Beckhams and Clooneys, oh my! Photo One of the great excitements about any wedding, of course, is the moment you learn who has been invited and who has not. Meghan and Harry’s list was kept secret, until the very moment that dozens of mysterious figures started to enter St. George’s Chapel. It was very exciting. There was none other than Oprah Winfrey, in a snug pink dress, a pair of very cool sunglasses and a massive broad-brimmed hat spectacularly festooned with flowers. If anyone qualifies as American royalty, it is surely Oprah, with her ability to transcend race and background, and her great gift for openness and emotional candor.

It turned into Celebrity Central. George and Amal Clooney made their stately, Hollywood-y entrance (She was in yellow with an interesting train). David and Victoria Beckham, a.k.a. Posh and Becks, came in and graced some people in the crowd with their conversation.","Both of them had a joyful and relaxed demeanor as they exchanged their vows. Fortunately, no one raised any objections to their marriage, an exhilarating moment during the ceremony. The event combined elements of tradition and modernity, blending centuries of history with contemporary touches. A notable presence was Oprah, as well as Meghan's African-American mother, who donned a conventional mother-of-the-bride ensemble alongside a nose stud, which surprisingly complemented her look.

Bishop Curry's passionate address emphasized the importance of love in both religion and life, quoting Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Lady Jane Fellowes, Harry's aunt and sister of the late Princess Diana, delivered a reading from the Song of Solomon that expressed joy and seemed to signify a lifting of Harry's long-standing sorrow since his mother's passing. The wedding dress received high praise for its elegant simplicity, crafted from double bonded silk cady with a boatneck, long sleeves, and a sweeping train.

The veil, five meters long, featured hand-embroidered flowers representing the various Commonwealth nations.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex later departed for their evening reception at Frogmore House, with Meghan wearing a second dress by Stella McCartney. The guests at the wedding appeared to be thoroughly enjoying themselves, creating an atmosphere similar to a star-studded cocktail party, free from the pressures of competition and excessive media attention. The change in tone can be attributed to both the evolving nature of Britain and the royal family, as well as Harry's position as the second son, allowing him more freedom to deviate from tradition. This wedding was not centered around royal lineage or securing the future of the monarchy but was instead focused on the love and celebration shared between two individuals. The guest list, initially kept secret, unveiled several notable figures, including Oprah Winfrey, whose presence symbolized her status as an American icon transcending race and background.

Heidi is a soon-to-be mom who posts videos of her dogs, and Spencer is best known as a reality TV scholar who dishes to the New York Times about pop culture in the era of President Donald Trump. But Speidi earned their reality TV status ten years ago this week when they launched a public feud against their Hills co-star Laura Conrad.  Their fight was anything but scholarly. Heidi and Lauren were once the Laverne and Shirley of MTV. They roomed together in West Hollywood, and fans expected the series to end with them serving as each other's bridesmaids. That is until Heidi started dating Spencer in season two. Lauren advised her to ditch him, but she refused. On the season finale, Heidi moved in with Spencer. Her friendship with Lauren was done.  On August 5, 2007, roughly a week before the season three premiere, Perez Hilton reported rumors that Lauren had filmed a sex tape with her ex, Laguna Beach cast member Jason Wahler. Lauren denied the claims to US Weekly, according to Gawker, saying, ""Honestly, they videotape my life five days out of the week. I don't need additional footage, you know?""  Lauren pointed the finger at her ex-roommate and her villainous boyfriend. As Tyra Banks later explained on her talk show while holding paper dolls of Spencer and Heidi: ""Spencer and Heidi have started a rumor about [Lauren]. It's a rumor about something really bad. Spencer and Heidi say that [Lauren has] a sex tape out there."" The accusation carried such dramatic intensity because fans had watched Lauren and Heidi's friendship strengthen over the course of the preceding seasons.  ""[Lauren's] the douche, the psycho,"" Spencer responded on Philadelphia's Q102 FM during his press tour for season three. Heidi likewise denied Lauren's claims.

""It's her party and she'll ban Spencer and Heidi if she wants to!"" TMZ blurbed on August 10. Lauren had allegedly booted Heidi and Spencer from MTV's premiere party, and US reported that MTV ordered Spencer and Heidi to walk the red carpet early and leave once Lauren arrived.  Looking back, Spencer believes the reality was even worse than the news reports.

Lauren denied the claims to US Weekly, according to Gawker, saying, ""Honestly, they videotape my life five days out of the week. I don't need additional footage, you know?""  Lauren pointed the finger at her ex-roommate and her villainous boyfriend. As Tyra Banks later explained on her talk show while holding paper dolls of Spencer and Heidi: ""Spencer and Heidi have started a rumor about [Lauren]. It's a rumor about something really bad. Spencer and Heidi say that [Lauren has] a sex tape out there."" The accusation carried such dramatic intensity because fans had watched Lauren and Heidi's friendship strengthen over the course of the preceding seasons.  ""[Lauren's] the douche, the psycho,"" Spencer responded on Philadelphia's Q102 FM during his press tour for season three. Heidi likewise denied Lauren's claims.    Read more: The Undying Love of Spencer and Heidi Pratt  On August 6, he went even further, launching SpencerPratt.com and attacking his enemy on the new platform. ""For all you Haters- Please feel free to Hate on me here on my blog/board were I actually read comments! … But if you hate me because you think I ruined Lauren and Heidi friendship…you have your facts all wrong!"" he wrote in his inauguratory post. ""Lauren ruined Heidi and Laurens friendship when she told Heidi that she could not be friends with her as long as she dated me … when those cameras turn off LC(BEEF CURTAINS) is a completely different person…she goes back to being the spoiled brat that made her famous on Laguna Beach.""  According to US Weekly, MTV ""suspended"" Spencer and Heidi's press appearances in response to the pair's ""trash-talking."" The news only boosted awareness of Speidi's war against Lauren. ""It's her party and she'll ban Spencer and Heidi if she wants to!"" TMZ blurbed on August 10. Lauren had allegedly booted Heidi and Spencer from MTV's premiere party, and US reported that MTV ordered Spencer and Heidi to walk the red carpet early and leave once Lauren arrived.  Looking back, Spencer believes the reality was even worse than the news reports. ""Actually, [Lauren] told MTV if they didn't stop filming with me she would quit and they told her then quit,"" he tells Broadly in a direct message. (Lauren's representative did not immediately respond to Broadly's request for comment.)  In the third season premiere, fans watched a similar party scene. At a club called Les Deux, Heidi hands Lauren a letter lamenting their dilapidated friendship. It does not mention the rumors. ""She won't fucking admit it,"" Lauren complains. She refuses to see her.  ""It's her problem,"" Heidi tells herself. But when Lauren flees the club, Heidi follows her.  ""You're not my friend anymore,"" Lauren tells her. ""I always feel bad for you,"" Heidi cries. She wants to know why Laur"

Fallout could easily have felt like more of the same, were it not for, among other things, Cruise’s fierce commitment to doing whatever he has to do to entertain people. Here, that means “nearly killing himself.” Not every one of this film’s 147 minutes is dedicated to action sequences that seem to catalogue the ways in which Tom Cruise could have died on set — the pre-title sequence is both ominous and deliciously twisty without featuring any severe action. But once Ethan and his not-entirely-willing new partner, CIA agent August Walker (a mustachioed Henry Cavill), have to do a HALO jump from above 20,000 feet in the air into a Parisian nightclub, Fallout isn’t playing around. Yes, Cruise pulled off that jump, just like he climbed up a rope to take over a helicopter mid-flight and jumped from one London building to another. (Of course, as you may know, he broke his ankle in the process, in a shot that’s in the finished film.) It’s difficult to know exactly what makes the Mission: Impossible franchise so special for Cruise, what makes it work so well for his intense persona. Movies like Jack Reacher: Never Go Back and The Mummy suggest that Cruise is looking for other franchises on which to work in between making M:I adventures. (Seeing that Cruise is co-starring in a Top Gun sequel next only furthers this notion.) But few of those capture the ineffable essence of Cruise the way that Ethan Hunt does. In Fallout, Hunt is at his most desperate. One of Ethan’s refrains in Fallout feels like a Cruise mission statement: “I’ll figure it out!” The tension in that statement is always in wondering how. Ethan, of course, does figure things out at the last second, but how he does is always thrilling. The same can’t be said for those other would-be franchises.

Maybe that’s just Wilmer. But I do believe that Latin people are just more expressive, more passionate with their emotions. He’s very manly, and he can be stubborn like Latino men can, but he’s protective and he cares so much and loves so hard.

By the way, love is fluid.” The singer added “Whether there’s been rumours with one specific person or not, that’s all that matters. Humans are humans, and when you connect with somebody on a spiritual level it doesn’t matter. I don’t want people to ever look at the past or rumours or anything and try to figure me out.” 4.

Yes, Kim and Kanye have decided to cancel all public and professional commitments for the end of the year and plan to maintain their social media blackouts as well. To be exact, a flack told Page Six that Kim and Kanye “plan on taking the rest of 2016 off and spending time as a family.""  Which, frankly, we wish we all could do, don't we?  Is it possible for President Obama's last major act to be an executive decree for us to just all get a chance to chill out and recuperate for the remaining 26 days left in this bummer of a year? Sure, there's no political safeguarding against any potential additional music legends from dying or preventing any further tragedies and disasters from happening or ensuring that some new odd Zika-like disease pops up, but there's got to be something? How about the ""Netflix and Chill Act?"" Just an order that all Americans get to spend the next month relaxing and catching up on any television series they may have missed this year.  Of course, when it comes to Kim and Kanye it's understandable that they've decided to literally cancel the rest of their 2016.

They've had to endure these private tragedies while also dealing with immense public interest and rumors running rampant in the tabloid press.

Kanye was released from an L.A.-area hospital last week after spending more than a week receiving treatment for exhaustion. Kim West was reportedly by his side throughout the entire ordeal and now wants to make sure Kanye continues to receive therapy and treatment now that he's out of the hospital.

The groom, Prince Harry, is a member of the British royal family; the bride, Meghan Markle, is an American and former actress.[note 1] On the morning of the wedding, Prince Harry's grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, conferred upon him the titles of Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel. On her marriage, Markle became Duchess of Sussex.[1] The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, officiated at the wedding using the standard Anglican church service for Holy Matrimony published in Common Worship, the liturgical text of the Church of England.[2][3] Announcement of engagement [ edit ] Prince Harry is the second son of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Diana, Princess of Wales. He and Meghan Markle, an American actress best known for her role in the Canadian-American legal-drama television series Suits, have been in a relationship since 2016, having first met in July 2016.[4] The relationship was officially acknowledged on 8 November 2016, when a statement was released from the royal family's communications secretary addressing the ""wave of abuse and harassment"" directed toward Markle.[5] Harry and Meghan attending church on Christmas Day, 2017 On 27 November 2017, Clarence House announced that Prince Harry would marry Markle in the spring of 2018.[6] They were engaged earlier the same month in London, with the Prince giving Markle a bespoke engagement ring made by Cleave and Company, the court jewellers and medalists to the Queen, consisting of a large central diamond from Botswana, with two smaller diamonds from his mother's jewellery collection.[7] At the same time, it was announced that they would live at Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace following their marriage.[8] The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh expressed their delight at the news, while congratulations came in from various political leaders, including the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, and the Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn. After the announcement, the couple gave an exclusive interview to Mishal Husain of BBC News.[8] During the public announcement of the engagement at Kensington Palace's Sunken Gardens, Markle wore a bottle knee-length emerald green dress with bow detailing at the cinched waist by Italian label P.A.R.O.S.H and a white trench coat by Canadian brand Line the Label.[9][10] Hours after the announcement, the website of Line the Label crashed down due to the number of people who were trying to order the coat.[7][11] Markle is the second American[note 2] and the first person of mixed race heritage to marry into the British royal family.[12] The engagement announcement prompted much comment about the possible social significance of Markle becoming a proudly mixed-race royal.[13][14][15][16][17] Under the terms of the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, the first six persons in the line of succession require the Sovereign's consent in order to marry. Harry was fifth in line at the time of his engagement.[18] The Queen's consent was declared to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom on 14 March 2018.[19][20] Although Markle attended a private Catholic school in her early years, she is not Roman Catholic.[21] On 6 March 2018, she was baptised and confirmed into the Church of England by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby at St. James's Palace.[22] Although Markle was divorced, the Anglican Church has permitted marriage to divorced persons with a living spouse since 2002.[23][24] After the engagement, Markle began the years-long process of becoming a British citizen.[25] She will retain her U.S. citizenship during the process,[26] but Kensington Palace have indicated that the decision on whether she will retain dual nationality has not yet been made.[25] Retaining U.S. citizenship is expected to create tax complications.[27] The couple was invited to celebrate Christmas 2017 with th",1,en,"The wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was held on 19 May 2018 in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle in the United Kingdom.

According to a new report, the Real Housewives of New Jersey star is planning to cash in on her husband Joe Giudice’s deportation proceedings.  If you recall, it was reported weeks ago that a judge had ruled that Joe should be deported upon his release from prison, where he is currently serving a 41-month-prison sentence for bank and wire fraud. Well now, sources are telling Radar Online that Bravo has offered Teresa $500,000 to film a special about his deportation.  “Teresa was offered big bucks to film a special about Joe’s deportation and she agreed to do it,” an insider revealed. “Half a million dollars to share the story on camera.”  And this story is believable because this isn’t Teresa’s first rodeo when it comes to cashing in on her crimes legal drama!  “It is going to be like the other specials when she was in prison and will show how she and Joe and the girls are handling the scary prospect of Joe getting deported,” added the source.  IS TERESA BEGGING PRESIDENT TRUMP TO STOP JOE’S DEPORTATION?  Earlier this year, an Immigration official confirmed that “records show that an immigration judge ordered Mr. Giudice be removed from the United States on March 14, 2018.”  A source close to Teresa adds that she needs the Bravo money as Joe tries to appeal the deportation order.  “Teresa will do anything for the money. She never stops thinking about taking care of her girls and she agreed to this so that they would have money for college. She is a good mom and wants to provide for her children,” the source stated.  Joe will reportedly be turned over to ICE custody upon his March 2019 release, although it is likely he could be released earlier than March which would mean an earlier deportation back to Italy.  UPDATE – Teresa is denying this report. Her attorney, James Leonard, tells the Gossip Cop website that she has no current plans to do a spinoff show about Joe’s possible deportation.

Scheduling a day for romance is as joyful as a deflated heart-shaped balloon.  We’re in Stanley’s on St Andrew’s Street in Dublin, downstairs in the wine bar. It’s an unplanned outing after an impromptu cry of “Let’s go out, but not to our usual place”. I’ve eaten here before, and enjoyed it except for some oversalted fish. This is a second chance. They don’t come easily.  But two things happened after the previous review. First, a man who was at the next table wrote to me to say how much he loved Stanley’s. He had no vested interest, but was talking as a well-dined eater about town. Later, I found out that chef and co-owner Stephen McArdle had something more important on his hands than my dinner that night. His son had been born hours before.  If that doesn’t earn a second chance, nothing will. So we’re tucked in at a small table under the sloping ceiling. The walls are painted a soft green. There’s a candle in a wax-crusted wine bottle on the table and high-class jazz standards on the sound system.  For the moment, it feels like we’re not in Dublin. We could be in a city anywhere and lucky enough to find a place we’ll remember fondly when we get home.  The menu is chalked up on the wall and Liam has already ordered some cod croquettes, balls of soft fluffy fish in crispy lagging jackets sitting in a small puddle of silken house mayonnaise.  The star of Stanley’s is Morgan Vanderkamer. She’s the sommelier here. But don’t let that put you off. Bad sommeliers are pretentious up-sellers, there to push diners towards the wallet-busting bruisers on the wine list. Vanderkamer has taken the nonsense out of the role and will open your mind to new ideas about what to drink with your food. If you thought sherry was for fogeys and posers, she will change your mind. So we have ice-cold glasses of manzanilla to cut through the fluffy cod croquettes. We are in excellent hands.  The main event is the Irish charcuterie sharing plate. We’re going with an oloroso, the ruby-coloured sherry that gets its colour and kick from time and ageing. There are two on the menu, Vanderkamer says. One is good; the other is “amazing”, and priced accordingly, she warns. With a €16 plate of food between us, we push the sherry cask out and live it large on the oloroso at €13 a glass. It is a good decision.  There’s a small farmyard on that €16 charcuterie plate: generous slices of duck ham, smoked cured slices of moist pink meat. The duck ham is the soulmate of the apricot puree dotted on one side of the plate. The sharp pickled gherkins sing with the “bacon and cabbage”, a slice of ham hock terrine wrapped in crinkly soft leaves of bright-green savoy cabbage. There are two small delicate slabs of mi-cuit fois gras, delicate to the point of dissolving on contact with the tongue. The pear and vanilla sauce, in a small ramekin, takes the sweetness of the liver to another even more decadent place.  Just in case there isn’t enough on the plate (there is), we’ve ordered a plate of the bean and chorizo stew. The beans are in fact chick peas – but that’s even better in my book – and the chorizo has been minced to a small rubble that sits on top of the soupy mix. It’s the kind of stew where the juices have transformed from separate elements of meat, tomato, oil and wine into one glistening sheen. We get a blended Priorat, a Spanish red as heartwarming as the stew, to sip with it.  Dessert would be an option only for people less greedy in their savoury ordering.

Dinner for two, with sherries a","Sometimes, the best outcomes come from the least planned endeavors. This is precisely why St Valentine's Day is despised by individuals who think rationally. Allocating a specific day for romance is as joyful as a deflated heart-shaped balloon. Currently, I am at Stanley's, located on St Andrew's Street in Dublin. This impromptu outing to a different location was prompted by a spontaneous decision of ""Let's go out, but not to our usual place."" I have dined here in the past and enjoyed it, except for the excessively salty fish. Nonetheless, I am giving it a second chance, as they are not easily earned. Two significant incidents occurred after my previous review. Firstly, a man sitting at the adjacent table wrote to inform me of his love for Stanley's. He had no personal interest in the matter but spoke as an experienced frequenter of establishments in town. Additionally, I later discovered that the chef and co-owner, Stephen McArdle, had a significant event on the same night as my previous dinner - the birth of his son. If that does not warrant a second opportunity, then nothing will. Therefore, we find ourselves comfortably seated at a small table beneath the sloping ceiling. The walls are painted in a soft green hue, and a candle in a wax-covered wine bottle adorns the table. The ambiance is complemented by the playing of high-quality jazz standards in the background, momentarily making it feel like we are not in Dublin. It could be any city, and we are fortunate enough to stumble upon a place that will be fondly remembered upon returning home. The menu, conveniently written on the wall, has already enticed Liam to order cod croquettes - delectable balls of tender fish encased in crispy exteriors, accompanied by a luscious house mayonnaise. The star of Stanley's is their sommelier, Morgan Vanderkamer. However, do not let that discourage you. Often, sommeliers can be excessively pretentious and push patrons towards expensive wines on the list. Vanderkamer, however, has eliminated all the nonsense from her role and will guide you towards innovative drink choices to complement your meal. If you previously discredited sherry as outdated or for pretentious individuals, she will change your perspective. Hence, we are served ice-cold glasses of manzanilla to perfectly complement the fluffy cod croquettes, ensuring we are in excellent hands. The highlight of the evening is the Irish charcuterie sharing plate. We opt for an oloroso, a ruby-colored sherry that derives its flavor and potency from aging. Vanderkamer highlights that there are two options on the menu, with one being good and the other being ""amazing,"" but priced accordingly. Considering our €16 plate of food between the two of us, we splurge on the €13 per glass oloroso. It proves to be a wise decision. The €16 charcuterie plate resembles a small farm with generous slices of duck ham, moist and pink smoked cured meat. The combination of the duck ham and apricot puree on one side of the plate is soulful. The sharpness of the pickled gherkins pairs beautifully with the ""bacon and cabbage,"" which consists of ham hock terrine wrapped in tender savoy cabbage leaves. Additionally, two delicate slabs of mi-cuit fois gras, almost dissolving upon touching the tongue, adorn the plate. The pear and vanilla sauce, served in a small ramekin, elevates the liver's sweetness to an even more indulgent level. In case the charcuterie plate is not sufficient (it is), we have ordered a plate of bean and chorizo stew. Surprisingly, the beans are actually chickpeas, which proves to be a delightful addition. The chorizo has been artistically minced into a rubble-like texture, adding flavor to the soupy mix. The stew has melded all its components - meat, tomato, oil, and wine - into a glistening sheen, creating a harmonious blend. To complement the stew, we are served a blended Priorat, a heartwarming Spanish red. Dessert is only reserved for those who show restraint in their savory choices. We co"

It’s been rumored for weeks that the 41-year-old had plans to purchase Cecil B. DeMille’s historic mansion, and now, she’s bit the bullet, putting down a $25 million offer, according to TMZ. The amount was reportedly accepted by the owner and is currently in escrow.  Cecil’s home, which he lived in until his death in 1959, is considered one of the greatest properties in L.A., and Angie will have some famous neighbors, including Casey Affleck, Natalie Portman and Ellen Pompeo. There’s tons of space for the six kids, too — the house boasts 6 bedrooms and 10 bathrooms, plus a spacious backyard.  This huge purchase comes following rumors that Angie planned on moving her kids to London so she could work there after her September 2016 split from Brad Pitt, 53. The possibility of that big move happening seemed even more likely after reports surfaced on April 12 that Angie had met and fallen in love with a British philanthropist and businessman, whose identity has not been revealed.  The actress is reportedly already serious with this mystery man, and a family friend told InTouch that she’s even planning on marrying him! However, we also know that Brad and Angie’s divorce has been much more amicable recently, and she’s been letting him spend more and more time with the kids.

Do you think she’s prepping for a wedding?","After spending $25 million, Angelina Jolie has purchased a new residence in Los Angeles. The speculation surrounding her potential marriage to a British entrepreneur has not deterred her from establishing permanent roots in California. The lavish Cecil B. DeMille estate is her latest acquisition, offering a glimpse into the stunning mansion through provided photographs. The 41-year-old actress had been rumored to have plans of purchasing this historic property for several weeks and has now followed through by making a $25 million offer, which has been accepted by the owner and is currently in escrow. The property, which was once occupied by Cecil B. DeMille until his passing in 1959, holds significant prestige in LA and will provide Angie with well-known neighbors such as Casey Affleck, Natalie Portman, and Ellen Pompeo. With 6 bedrooms, 10 bathrooms, and a spacious backyard, there is enough space for her six children. This substantial investment comes amidst rumors that Angie intended to relocate her children to London for work purposes following her separation from Brad Pitt in September 2016. These rumors gained traction after reports emerged on April 12 stating that Angie had met a British philanthropist and businessman whom she was deeply in love with, but whose identity remained undisclosed. It is speculated that she plans to marry this mystery man. Nevertheless, her divorce from Brad Pitt has become more amicable recently, and she has allowed him to spend increasing amounts of time with their children. Staying in Los Angeles could be a way for her to ensure that Pax, Maddox, Zahara, Shiloh, Vivienne, and Knox maintain a strong relationship with their father. Whatever her reasons, her new house is undeniably impressive. What are your thoughts on Angelina Jolie's new residence? Do you believe it signifies preparations for an upcoming wedding?"
gossipcop-938651,"No. overall No. in season Title CBS recap Rating/share (18-49) Original air date US viewers (millions) Weekly rank Host Jeff Probst explained the Ghost Island premise to the 20 new castaways upon their arrival, saying that they had a chance to reverse the curse of bad Survivor decisions if they were to visit Ghost Island. Jeff instructed each tribe to choose a leader: Malolo selected Brendan, while Chris volunteered for Naviti. Jeff also told the castaways they would only start with a machete, pot, a fishing kit, and a smaller supply of rice. Reward Challenge: A designated runner will have to race through a series of obstacles to dig up three sets of keys. Then, a designated puzzle solver will use the keys to unlock a slide puzzle. The first person to finish their puzzle wins a massive shelter building kit reward for their tribe. Additionally, the losing tribe will be forced to forfeit their fishing kit. However, if the tribe leader decides to forfeit the challenge during the puzzle solving portion, their tribe will get to keep the fishing kit, but the opposing tribe will get 20 eggs and flint in addition to the shelter building kit. For Malolo and Naviti, respectively, Michael and Sebastian were selected to run the course, while Laurel and Desiree were selected for the puzzle. Chris pulled the lever on Desiree, preserving Naviti’s fishing kit, but giving the larger reward to Malolo. As the Malolo tribe set up their shelter and got to know each other, Jacob openly stated his intention to search for a hidden immunity idol, causing his tribemates to distrust him. He also poured some of the tribe’s rice in his dirty sock to see if a clue was hidden in the jar, though there was not. Meanwhile at the Naviti camp, a power struggle started between Chris and Domenick, who questioned Chris’s decision to forfeit the opening challenge. Immunity Challenge: Each tribe will have to race across a net bridge to where two bags are hanging. Working together, they will then need to untie the bags to obtain a pair of ropes. Using the ropes, the tribe will need to slide a sled full of big puzzle pieces through a course. At the end of the course, they will need to solve a cube puzzle to win immunity. Naviti won the challenge, and also received a flint reward, as Malolo already had flint after winning the first reward challenge. For winning the immunity challenge, Naviti had to send one person from Malolo to Ghost Island, where they would be immune from the vote; Naviti sent Jacob after he declared Malolo was the best tribe in Survivor history. On Ghost Island, Jacob had to break an urn to play a game for an advantage; if he lost, he would have to forfeit his vote at the next Tribal Council. He subsequently won a game of chance which gave him Sierra’s legacy advantage from Game Changers. He had to will it to someone from Naviti, and he chose Morgan. He also made a fake idol. At Malolo, the tribe had to come up with a new plan, as Jacob was their intended target. Gonzalez rallied votes against Donathan for being the tribe’s weakest link, but at Tribal Council, her paranoia got the better of her as she whispered to her tribemates, asking who they were targeting that night. Although everyone told her they were targeting Donathan, it was revealed that they had lied to her, and Gonzalez was unanimously blindsided, becoming the first person voted out. At Naviti, Domenick searched for a hidden immunity idol in the middle of the night, which he eventually found; it was revealed to be Andrea’s idol from Caramoan. The next morning, he attempted to bury the hatchet with Chris, but the tension still lingered between the two. Domenick told Chris he found an idol moments after telling him the opposite, which caused Chris to distrust him.

Another member will need to gather all of the marked buoys to the finish, where the last four members will need to get all eight in a basket to win immunity and a comfort reward of chairs, pillows, blankets, and a washboard. Naviti easily won after James could not even dive a foot in the water. Donathan panicked before eventually diving down and releasing the buoys for Malolo. Naviti sent Donathan to Ghost Island, and the urn he smashed was a dud. At Malolo, Stephanie considered working with Jacob to blindside Michael, but Jacob spilled the beans about the legacy advantage to Stephanie.

After Han asks Chewie how he knows to fly the ship, the young smuggler gets a surprising answer.  “190 years old?” Han asks, translating Chewbacca’s response for the viewer. “You look great!”  Based on the new information, it isn’t too difficult to guess Chewbacca’s age in Star Wars: Episode IV — A New Hope, the first time he appeared.

It makes me feel awful.”  This Morning/ITV  Kimberly said that Keaton expressed that he didn’t want to return even to the middle school even “when the whole world wanted to come and eat lunch with him.”  “I’ve struggled anyway especially being this close to Christmas break, but after seeing how big it got, I mean it just seems like maybe we should let it die down a little bit before we made any decisions so that we could kind of have a reality of what life is gonna be like,” she continued.  Love What Matters/Facebook  Keaton, of Knoxville, captivated the Internet earlier this month after a video uploaded by his mother showed the boy in tears as he lamented the bullying he’s endured at school. In the video, Keaton revealed that the bullies, “make fun of my nose. They call me ugly. They say I have no friends.”  However, Keaton’s emotional story took a turn when photos surfaced showing the family with Confederate flags. They faced more criticism when rumors circulated that the family used Keaton’s story for financial gain.  “I’ve said over and over, I’m an adult, I know who I am. I’m obviously sorry that it has offended so many people, but the backlash to my children…” Kimberly said during the morning show. “That’s something I wouldn’t wish on anybody.”  She added that the backlash has “brought the bullies out.” Kimberly also denied being racist in interviews with ABC and CBS News.  As the backlash seemingly began to subside, the family faced a new wave of criticism as photos from the Facebook page of Shawn White, Keaton’s allegedly estranged father, showed him sharing white supremacist propaganda. The pictures prompted Keaton’s older sister, Lakyn Jones, to defend her family in a tweet.

BECAUSE of their actions. That’s why all the articles say ‘estranged’ because we don’t talk to them. Leave us alone.”  Family friend Kaley Katz worked to shut down the criticism, telling PEOPLE that the accusations of racism are “rumors” and that it’s not true that Keaton is the target of bullying because he used a racial slur.  “The rumors are fake,” family friend Kaley Katz tells PEOPLE. “She is not a racist, Keaton did not bully anyone at his school, and she did not start the GoFundMe account in order for it to be a scam.”",0,en,0,"Tennessee middle-schooler Keaton Jones is opening up about life after his anti-bullying video, revealing that he hasn’t returned to school since the footage spread across the Internet.

Leave us alone.”  Family friend Kaley Katz worked to shut down the criticism, telling PEOPLE that the accusations of racism are “rumors” and that it’s not true that Keaton is the target of bullying because he used a racial slur.  “The rumors are fake,” family friend Kaley Katz tells PEOPLE. “She is not a racist, Keaton did not bully anyone at his school, and she did not start the GoFundMe account in order for it to be a scam.”"

Beyond his impact as a multi-hyphenate force in our industry, Judd’s comedic chops, social consciousness, and lifelong love of film and television underlie his unique ability to entertain with heart – whether behind the scenes or in front of a live audience. And when it comes to expertise in live events, specials, and awards, nothing compares to the great Don Mischer. To our Guild’s fortune, Don has graciously agreed to add Awards Chair to his growing list of service and contributions to our Guild.”  Judd Apatow  Judd Apatow is considered one of the most sought-after comedy minds in the business. He has been closely associated with many of the biggest comedy films and hit television shows over the last decade and a half.  Apatow recently filmed his upcoming Netflix standup special, The Return, at the Just for Laughs Comedy Festival in Montreal. The Return premiered on December 12 and marks Judd’s first solo standup special and literal return to his first love of performing standup which is how he began his career 25 years ago when he performed on HBO’s Young Comedians special in 1992.  Apatow made his documentary directorial debut with the 2016 Emmy Award-nominated ESPN Films 30 for 30 feature, Doc & Darryl, which chronicled the successes and scandals of New York Mets legends Dwight “Doc” Gooden and Darryl Strawberry. He followed that up with the forthcoming co-directed HBO documentary, May It Last, about folk rock icons the Avett Brothers premiering on HBO later this month.  Continuing down the documentarian path, Apatow is in post-production on a documentary on Garry Shandling who served as Judd’s mentor and father figure. The two-part documentary will air over two nights in late March on HBO.  Additionally, Apatow currently serves as co-executive producer of the television series Crashing, which returns to HBO for its second season in January 2018. He is also the co-executive producer of Netflix’s Love which returns for its third season in March 2018. Lastly, Apatow co-executive produced the multi-award-winning HBO series Girls which wrapped its final season earlier this year.  On the film side, Apatow recently produced the 2017 romantic comedy, The Big Sick, starring Kumail Nanjiani, Holly Hunter and Ray Romano. The dark horse box office success earned a 97% on Rotten Tomatoes which was the highest rated film of the summer.  Apatow has written and directed such films as The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Knocked Up, and Trainwreck. He has also produced Superbad, Bridesmaids, Pineapple Express, and both Anchorman films, to name but a few.  Apatow has been a DGA member for two decades.

The Emmy-winning actress and Seagal costarred in the 1991 film Out for Justice.  A representative for Seagal did not respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment on Friday,  “When I was 23, a casting director, a woman, said, ‘Steven Seagal wants to go over the scene with you in his hotel room at 10 o’clock at night,'” Margulies told Jenny Hutt for SiriusXM’s Just Jenny on Friday.  “I lived in Brooklyn, and I said, ‘Oh, I don’t do that.

gossipcop-4796409702,"Kim Kardashian is allegedly “phasing out” mom Kris Jenner, particularly when it comes to her responsibilities as her longtime manager, amid reports Kim is ready for a total image overhaul after returning to the spotlight following her October robbery.  That’s according to a new report by Radar Online, who’s claiming that the mother-daughter duo could be caught in a nasty feud as a source alleged that Kardashian has had somewhat of an epiphany during her time away from the spotlight and allegedly has now opened her eyes to see how Jenner “used her” to build the Kardashian brand.  According to the site, Kim is ready to project a very different image from the uber-glamorous money flaunting Kardashian fans used to know and is allegedly ready to kick mom Kris to the curb, at least professionally, in order to do so.  A source alleged to the site this week that Kim now “seems to be thinking that Kris used her to get where she is today,” which Radar Online is alleging could have led to a nasty feud between Jenner and her daughter as well as the reality star reportedly making a pretty big business decision when it comes to her mom.  “[Kim] will never think of [Kris] in the same way again,” the source said of Jenner’s supposed drama with her daughter amid reports she believes Jenner has been “using” her for years.  The site then went on to report that Kim is now in the process of projecting her new toned-down image amid the feud claims with Kris, revealing that Jenner may no longer play such a big part in Kardashian’s career going forward.  “Kim hired a transition team to make sure that she gives off a different image than she did previously,” the source said of Jenner and her daughter potentially parting ways professionally, claiming that “part of this process includes phasing out [Kris’s] management.”  While Kris and Kim have not commented on the claims, this isn’t the first time it’s been reported that Kardashian may be looking to distance herself from Jenner, at least professionally, in the wake of her October robbery in Paris.  Radar Online claimed back in October that Kim Kardashian had grown wise to Kris Jenner’s “money making machine” after taking some downtime at the end of 2016, alleging at the time that Kim has been so busy with her career that she’s failed to realize how much Jenner, who is often referred to as her “momager,” had been controlling her life and career.  “Kim never realized how much [Kris] and the money-making machine was controlling her until this robbery,” an insider told the site of Kardashian’s feelings about Jenner at the time, months before it was reported that the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star is allegedly looking to “phase out” Kris from her career.  “Kim is just starting to think that maybe Kris’s intentions were not pure all along,” continued the source in October, adding that Kim has been doing a lot of thinking about her father Robert Kardashian while taking some time away which has allegedly helped her to get wise to Kris’s seemingly relentless pursuit of fame for herself and her family.  “[Kim] told her family that she wanted to be the girl that her father wanted her to be and not the girl that she became with Kris’s help,” a source revealed last year, just months before it was reported that a feud could be brewing between Kardashian and Jenner.

After her return to the spotlight following a robbery in October, Kim is said to be ready for a complete image transformation. Radar Online claims that the mother-daughter duo might be involved in a feud as Kim has supposedly realized how Jenner had allegedly used her to build the Kardashian brand. Kim is allegedly ready to project a different, more subdued image, and may be planning to separate professionally from her mom. Reports suggest that Kim now believes Kris used her to achieve her own success, and this alleged drama has strained their relationship.

Although Kris and Kim have not responded to these claims, this is not the first time it has been suggested that Kim wants to distance herself from her mom, especially after the Paris robbery. It was reported in October that Kim had become aware of Kris's control over her life and career.

gossipcop-3967904178,"Watch Entertainment Tonight on Yahoo View.  Music’s odd couple, Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton — aka the rocker and the country boy — have never been free of gossip speculating about their relationship. Apparently, the latest news is that the two are through. In Touch Weekly reports that Shelton actually unceremoniously dumped Stefani in February before embarking on a tour.  But wait — if that’s the case, then why is Stefani appearing with him on stage? And not just appearing … they’re appearing pretty cuddly. The singer posted an Instagram shot on Mar. 14 of the two embracing on what appears to be the most recent date of his “Country Music Freaks” trek.      This isn’t the first such picture she has shared since February. She posted several different angles of a jumbotron kiss on Feb. 25, and on March 11, one of herself hanging out with country up-and-comer Carly Pearce, who is an opener on Shelton’s tour, and another that shows off a backstage crowd (including Shelton and her younger brother Todd) in Greensboro, N.C.      Additionally, she sent good wishes to him on Mar. 1 — when Shelton was reportedly attempting to power through a Houston date while sick with the flu — and shared his latest video, “I Lived It” with a glowing string of hashtags.      So if the breakup is fake news, what spurred the rumors? According to In Touch‘s “insider” source, all of Stefani’s social media support is “a desperate attempt to ignore the truth,” and Shelton dumped her due to her “neediness and all the drama: her demanding, critical ex-husband, and her jealousy of him and other women.”  If this is to be believed, current Voice champion Chloe Kohanski was a factor in the breakup — Coach Shelton was apparently getting too close for Stefani’s comfort — as well as Shelton’s ex-wife Miranda Lambert, with whom the outlet claims he has rekindled a friendship and is “sharing intimate details” of his life.  Shelton isn’t reciprocating Stefani’s loving social media deluge — but then again, he’s never been one to do so. His social media accounts, once a source of ribald jokes, have developed gradually into a more businesslike platform to market his music and work on The Voice. He does, however, maintain a picture of Stefani as his profile photo.  Read more from Yahoo Entertainment:",1,en,"Watch Entertainment Tonight on Yahoo View.

gossipcop-874373,"If you're a Teen Mom: OG fan, then by now, you've probably heard the news that Amber Portwood and Matt Baier have broken up.  Fans have been hoping these two would part ways pretty much from the day they went public with their relationship, and now that Amber has a new boyfriend, it seems it's safe to say she and Matt are well and truly over.  But while TMOG viewers may be thrilled by the split, Matt is most definitely not.  The newly single Baier opened up about his split from Amber in a recent interview with E! News:  ""I'm trying to do a lot of work on myself because I realize now the downfall of our relationship was my fault,"" he explained.  ""When you're thrust into the spotlight like that, it can affect you. My mistake was taking our relationship for granted.""  Baier says the high-profile nature of the relationship was part of the problem (which is odd, because he never would have met Amber if she weren't on TV), but he also accepts responsibility for being a less-than-stellar partner:  ""What I've learned from this is you have to do the work,"" he told the outlet.  ""You have to make the person you're with feel loved every single day. I forgot to do that and now I'm paying the price.""  Matt says he's full of regrets over the way his relationship played out, and if given a second chance, he would change everything about the way he behaved.  ""If I got a do-over,"" he said, ""I would do everything differently. I should have listened to her more.""  The couple was filming a new season of the We TV reality series Marriage Boot Camp at the time of their split.  Matt left the set ahead of schedule and took off for Vegas - where he's apparently been living ever since.  ""I went to Vegas to get my head around the split. Ultimately, my hope was to get a place where Amber could come visit me and we could work on our issues. Obviously, that didn't happen.""  But despite the fact that Amber is in a new relationship, Matt is still hopeful that she'll find her way back to him:  ""I'll hold out hope for a reconciliation. But if nothing else, I hope we can stay friends,"" Baier says.  ""We started off as best friends and that's what I miss the most from her—her friendship. To not have that is painful. When something happens, my natural instinct still is to call her and tell her everything. She was my family.""  As though that's not depressing enough, Baier concluded the info with some insights into his day-to-day life post-Amber:  ""I've been making a living through my [poker] winnings,"" he says.  ""That said, I'm not really enjoying it. This isn't the life I want to live.""  Yeesh.

Last May, the foursome gathered at Tamblyn's directorial debut, an indie called Paint It Black, and this week they came together once again to support one of their own: this time Ferrera. Two days after the Ugly Betty star announced that she and her husband, director Ryan Piers Williams, are expecting their first child, she and her former co-stars turned friends reunited to celebrate.  Of course, it wouldn't be a real reunion with documentation and, as such, Ferrera shared a photo of the occasion.

Plus, last fall Tamblyn teased to Entertainment Weekly , “I have very high hopes for it happening sooner rather than later.” Ferrera has said the same, telling E!

""Starting the New Year off with blessings from my Sisterhood,"" Ferrera wrote in the caption on Instagram. ""We’ve got work to do for the next generation. Let’s get to it. #TIMESUP""  Loading View on Instagram  Ferrera previously announced her pregnancy on Instagram in a New Year's photo with Williams where the pair showed off a baby onesie that said ""más besos (por favor)"" (translation: ""more kisses please""). ""We’re welcoming one more face to kiss in 2018!,"" she wrote. ""Wishing you #MásBesos in the New Year! #babybesos #HappyNewYear 😘""  Loading View on Instagram  As for whether or not Ferrera, Lively, Tamblyn and Bledel would reunite for the big screen once again, it seems like it's just a matter of time until they do. News of a third Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants film first spread back in 2014 when Variety revealed that a threequel was officially in the works with Dawson's Creek writer Liz Garcia in charge of adapting the novel — specifically the fifth and final one, Sisterhood Everlasting, as the sequel was adapted from the second, third and fourth books. Plus, last fall Tamblyn teased to Entertainment Weekly , “I have very high hopes for it happening sooner rather than later.” Ferrera has said the same, telling E! News , ""It's an idea and a conversation. I think it would be amazing. The sisterhood is still well and alive. I love my girls. We're very much a part of each other's lives and if the movie happens it would be a great thing.""

Elton John may’ve had an intense health scare in April, but the Tiny Dancer singer has in no way slowed down. In fact, the A-lister brought his notable sass to the Cannes Film Festival where he addressed an audience alongside longtime songwriting partner, Bernie Taupin.  Related: Elton & Countless Others Pay Tribute To Chris Cornell!  During his first public appearance since recovering from his health problems, the Grammy winner talked about the music that came after his rise to fame — and let’s just say he didn’t have the nicest things to say. Specifically, the hitmaker noted:  “We were before the MTV generation and I’m glad we were because we were real artists… The MTV generation brought along a lot of people who were great but a lot of people who just made videos. So a lot of the artistry went out of the music.”  Ouch. Although Elton didn’t name any artists in particular, it’s clear there are many people the 70-year-old disapproves of. We mean, we feel like we can guess ONE particular performer Mr. John doesn’t respect musically *cough* Madonna *cough*. Yes, okay. Elton and the Material Girl supposedly settled their beef — but we have a feeling it could reignite at any time.  LOLz! Nonetheless, the iconic songwriter doesn’t hate everything about the rise of music videos. He added:  “Visuals├óΓé¼ΓÇ¥whether it is a painting, a drawing, a piece of film, a video├óΓé¼ΓÇ¥enhance music. You get to use your imagination; you get into it.”  Well, we’re glad Elton doesn’t hate music videos as he was at Cannes in order to speak on behalf of his YouTube competition where fans were asked to create music videos for hits like Rocket Man, Tiny Dancer, and Bennie and the Jets.

gossipcop-951505,"They fittingly met on the ‘80s hit show Family Ties, but it wasn’t love at first sight for Michael J. Fox and Tracy Pollan. In fact, both were seeing other people at the time and it would be several years before the pair coupled up to become one of Hollywood’s most enduring relationships. Although their characters Alex P. Keaton and Ellen Reed were loved up on Family Ties, in real life Pollan was in a serious long-term relationship with Kevin Bacon and Fox was dating Facts of Life actress Nancy McKeon. ""I always thought [Tracy] was cool,"" Fox told People years later, ""but it was like a couple of married people who worked together and liked each other."" It wasn’t until 1987 when the Pollen and Fox worked together in a movie called Bright Lights, Big City that a romance began to blossom. Pollan told Winfrey in 2002: ""From the beginning, I loved his sense of humour and that brain of his. He's so smart."" Fox told People in 1989 of hearing that Pollen and Bacon had split: ""It sounds really horrible, but it was one of those things. Someone goes, 'Did you hear that so-and-so aren't together anymore?' and you go, 'Hmm, that's too bad. Where's the phone?'"" Seven months after they started dating, he proposed on December 26, 1987. ""I wasn't really worried that she would say no,"" he recalled. ""The toughest part was trying to figure out when to get married, and then to figure out how nobody else could know about it."" The couple tied the knot in an outdoor ceremony at Vermont's West Mountain Inn on July 16, 1988. Fox, who is Episcopalian, and Pollan, who is Jewish, had an interfaith ceremony with both a minister and rabbi. ""Michael seemed a little nervous,"" Rev. Joan O'Gorman later told People. ""In fact, they seemed just like any other young and loving couple who were excited to be getting married."" Their first child, a son they named Sam Michael, was born on May 30, 1989. Fox and Pollan loved being parents, and would go on to have twin girls, Aquinnah Kathleen and Schuyler Frances, in 1995, and one more daughter, Esmé, in 2001. ""I kind of shut the door and said to everyone we love who wanted to see the baby, 'Just give us a little bit of time to get used to it ourselves,'"" Fox said after the birth of Sam. ""What's interesting is that the parental instinct just kicks in. The next thing you know, you've got a sore hip because you're holding him all the time."" The couple grew even closer when faced with one of life’s biggest challenges – Fox was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease at age 29 in 1991 (though it wasn’t until 1998 that he shared the news publicly). ""A lot of my adjustment has been dictated by Michael's point of view,"" Pollan said in a 2002 interview with Oprah Winfrey. ""He's so relaxed and so accepting of where he is, and that makes it easier for me, the kids, and everyone around him."" But when the couple first received the news, it completely shocked and devastated them. Fox fell into a depression and started drinking heavily, before eventually getting a handle on his new reality. ""I used to drink to party,"" the actor recalled on The Howard Stern Show in 2013, ""but...now I was drinking alone and to just not be [present]. Every day."" ""So once I did that,"" he continued, ""then there was about a year of, like, a knife fight in a closet, where I just didn't have my tools to deal with it. Then after that, I went into therapy and it all started to get really clear to me."" He said he realised he just had to take life ""one day at a time” and ""then everything started to really turn the other way. My marriage got great, and my career..."" Stern interjected here to suggest Fox's marriage ""got great"" after he realszed that Pollan wasn't going anywhere after his diagnosis. ""Exactly,"" Fox agreed. Fox later told Winfrey: ""There were a lot of questions I was afraid to ask Tracy. ""Like, 'Does it scare you that I'm sick? Do you not love me because I'm sick?' I didn't ask her those questions.

When Fox publicly revealed that he had Parkinson's disease in 1998, he began in earnest his life’s mission of raising awareness and money for Parkinson’s through the Michael J. Fox Foundation. As of April 2017 the foundation has funded more than $700 million in research. ""The reason I wasn't telling was that I wondered if people would still laugh if they knew I was sick,"" Fox told Winfrey. ""Can you laugh at a sick person [on TV] and not feel like an a--hole? I finally thought, let me not worry about that. What other people think is none of my business. I just have to have faith in the audience. If it's funny, they'll laugh."" And every day the couple deal with Fox's condition, but always as a team. ""Tracy wasn't sentimental or romantic about it at all,"" he told AARP magazine in 2017 about how his wife reacted to his Parkinson's diagnosis. ""No terror. No big windy... So, no exhibition of grief and fear. Tracy was just like, 'You've got a stone in your shoe. We'll do what we can until you can get it out. In the meantime, if you limp with the stone, that's all right. You can hold my hand, and we'll get over that.'"" Pollan added that, of course, there were tough days, but they both knew they were in this together. ""Through it all we've loved each other,"" Fox said. ""And that love never died,"" Pollan added.

Rihanna added:  ""I always knew it would happen, I always focused on the result, and that kind of faith, it really was just faith that childlike faith, that even now when I get a little bit discouraged or doubtful, it’s the thing that I go back to, having faith in God, like that even as a child.”  (Photo caption: Rihanna with her head bowed during the opening prayer at the renaming ceremony. (PHOTO: Richard Grimes))  On the fake YouTube video many people in the comments said that the video was a hoax and a lie. People called for the voice clip and video showing Rihanna making that fabricated speech and they asked why the video was missing from all other news agencies.  The ceremony was also broadcast live on TV in Barbados so tens of thousands of Bajans can refute the lies in the video and article aforementioned as well.  See Loop's video taken November 30, 2017, at Rihanna Drive in Barbados, with Rihanna's speech below:","A false video is circulating that claims Rihanna made a controversial statement about Jesus and Satan during a ceremony where she was honored as Cultural Ambassador by the Prime Minister of Barbados. However, this video is completely fabricated. Rihanna actually gave a speech encouraging people to believe in their dreams and have faith in God. The ceremony was also broadcast live on TV, so there is evidence to refute the false claims made in the viral video."

For people that know the brand, it’s super exciting. There are so many ideas we’re kicking around in the direction of where the film leads you.""

It’s believed the loved-up stars had flown to Missouri because Jen was desperate to reconnect with Brad’s mum, Jane, who she’d developed a very close bond with throughout the time of their first marriage.  During the seven-day visit, it’s been revealed that Jane orchestrated a meeting with the family priest Reverend Swadley – hoping it would be the gentle push Brad and Jen would need to make their reignited relationship official once again.  ‘Reverend Swadley met Jen recently at a family function that Brad’s mum, Jane, threw at their family home in Missouri,’ a close friend of the pastor’s told New Idea exclusively.  ‘Jen accompanied Brad home on the trip and attended church services with the family as well as joining Brad at meetings at the now-retired reverend’s home, who Brad reconnected with after he decided to find himself and renew his faith, following his split from Ange.  ‘He remarked at how at ease Jen was with his family, who clearly adore her, and how everyone said how much she’s been missed and how happy they all were to have her back in Brad’s – and their – lives.’  The source goes on to reveal that Reverend Swadley spoke at length with Brad and Jen about getting married as soon as possible, in Missouri, in a small ceremony, with just local friends and family present.  ‘Reverend Swadley revealed how in love Brad and Jen were and how they planned to officially wed as soon as their divorces were finalised, with him agreeing to conduct the ceremony and welcome them both back into the church,’ the friend of the pastor told New Idea.  Reverend Swadley revealed to our source that it was clear Jen loved seeing Brad’s family again, spending long days talking and laughing for the first time since their 2005 divorce.  ‘Jen spent five days reconnecting with Brad’s parents, brother and sister and many of his childhood friends who he remains close to,’ a friend of the pastor reveals.  Brad Pitt's parents are nothing but supportive Getty  ‘He said Jen kept saying how grateful she was that they’d been brought back together. And how they’ll both be baptised later this year before they officially wed – with Jen’s father, John, vowing to be at her side for the service and give her away again at their wedding, which will hopefully take place shortly after and be far more low-key than their original star-studded nuptials in Malibu.’  It’s the latest chapter in the pair’s rekindled romance since Jen announced her split from estranged husband Justin Theroux in February. She has wasted no time in rebuilding her relationship with ex-husband Brad, spending time with his six children, and developing a unique and special bond with his 11-year-old daughter Shiloh.  It’s that close relationship between Jen and his kids that has prompted Brad to want to marry Jen as soon as soon as possible.  ‘Brad’s mum Jane was all over them to get married as soon as possible, but the truth is Brad needs no convincing,’ says a source close to Brad. ‘They still want to keep this relationship close to their chest and out of the public eye, but behind closed doors they couldn’t be happier.  ‘And for Brad, seeing how much his children – especially Shiloh – love Jen has just made his heart soar.

The purpose of their visit was for Jen to reconnect with Brad's mother, Jane, whom she had formed a close bond with during their previous marriage. During their stay, Jane organized a meeting between the couple and Reverend Swadley, hoping that it would encourage Brad and Jen to formalize their reignited relationship. A friend of the pastor disclosed that Reverend Swadley met Jen at a family event hosted by Jane at their home in Missouri. Throughout the visit, Jen accompanied Brad to church services and attended meetings at the retired reverend's house. Reverend Swadley expressed that Jen fit in comfortably with Brad's family, who greatly cherished her presence and expressed their happiness at her return to their lives. The anonymous source further revealed that Reverend Swadley discussed marriage plans with Brad and Jen, suggesting a small ceremony in Missouri with only close friends and relatives. The pastor also agreed to officiate the wedding and welcome them back into the church once their divorces were finalized. Our insider shared that it was evident to Reverend Swadley that Jen cherished the opportunity to spend time with Brad's family, sharing laughter and conversations like they hadn't since their divorce in 2005. During this visit, Jennifer spent five days reconnecting with Brad's parents, siblings, and childhood friends. Jen repeatedly expressed her gratitude for being reunited with them and mentioned plans for both her and Brad to be baptized before the wedding. Her father, John, promised to be present at the baptism and to walk her down the aisle again, making the occasion more intimate than their previous extravagant wedding in Malibu. This recent development in their rekindled romance follows Jennifer's separation from her estranged husband, Justin Theroux, in February. Jennifer wasted no time building her relationship with Brad, spending time with his six children and forming a strong bond with his 11-year-old daughter, Shiloh. It is this close bond between Jennifer and the children that has led Brad to desire a quick marriage. According to a source close to Brad, his mother has been encouraging them to marry soon, but Brad needs no persuasion as he wants Jennifer to be his wife once again. Although they prefer to keep their relationship private, behind closed doors, they are extremely happy. It is likely that they will get married in Missouri before the end of the year, as Brad and Jen are eager to finalize their divorces and walk down the aisle together."

Her account, posted early Saturday morning, comes in the wake of the continuing #metoo movement and the launch of the Time’s Up campaign to combat sexual harassment and assault.  In a Facebook post, Dushku wrote that she was assaulted while working with Kramer on the 1994 James Cameron film “True Lies.” According to her post, Kramer molested her in a Miami hotel room, where he “laid me down on the bed, wrapped me with his gigantic writhing body, and rubbed all over me.” Kramer would have been 36 at the time.  Dushku alleges that he “methodically built my and my parents’ trust, for months grooming me,” and told her parent that he would take her for a swim in the hotel’s pool. Instead, her took her to his hotel room, where he “disappeared in the bathroom and emerged, naked, bearing nothing but a small hand towel held flimsy at his mid-section.”  Kramer told Variety Saturday morning that Dushku’s allegations were “absolutely not true.” According to Kramer, Dushku swam in the hotel pool with him and other members of the stunt crew, including Dushku’s stunt double. Afterwards, he took her to her first ever sushi meal, and then took her home.

Dushku also wrote that while in a taxi back to her hotel, Kramer held her on his lap in the backseat. According to Kramer, he drove the car to take her home.  She also implies that Kramer may have intentionally harmed her while on the set of “True Lies,” referring to it as “no small coincidence” when she was injured on-set after a “tough adult female friend” faced him about the alleged assault.  “With broken ribs, I spent the evening in the hospital,” she wrote. “To be clear, over the course of those months rehearsing and filming ‘True Lies,’ it was Joel Kramer who was responsible for my safety on a film that at the time broke new ground for action films.”  She also wrote that Kramer would call her “Jailbait,” and that she doesn’t understand why no adults on the set grew suspicious of the “over-the-top special attention he gave me.”  “Over the years I’ve really struggled as I’ve wondered how my life might have been different if someone, any one grown-up who witnessed his sick ways, had spoken up before he lured me to that hotel room.”  Dushku explained that she had heard, years ago, that Kramer had been “found out” and forced to leave the business, but recently learned he was still working in the industry.  “And a few weeks ago, I found an internet photo of Joel Kramer hugging a young girl,” she wrote. “That image has haunted me near nonstop since. I can no longer hide what happened.”  She expressed gratitude for the support of her fans, and wrote that she hopes her speaking out will help other victims of sexual assault.  Kramer stated that he was “taken aback” and “floored” by the allegations, and that he “never molested her” and was “never nude in front of her.”  “This whole talk of luring her to my room, on top of her, getting off, holding her in the car and calling her jailbait is just outright hyperbole and lies,” he said.  Kramer, who has worked on numerous high-profile films such as “Blade Runner 2049” and “Furious 7,” said he had no explanation for the allegations, but stated that he thought she may have had a crush on him at the time. According to Kramer, another person working on the set had told him that Dushku was “always asking questions” about him, which caused him to feel he had to “handle her with kid gloves.”  “I did kiss her on the cheek once to say goodnight to her, gave her a hug,” he said. “We treated her like family, she was part of our crew.”  He refer",0,en,0,"Eliza Dushku has accused stunt coordinator Joel Kramer of molesting her when she was 12 years old.

gossipcop-890653,"By Heidi Peiper / Starbucks Newsroom For 20 years, the return of the Starbucks holiday cups have marked the arrival of the season. It’s a ritual for many that’s as beloved as that first sip of Peppermint Mocha. It’s not easy to find the very first Starbucks holiday cups, which made their debut in stores in 1997. Few were saved, and electronic design files were lost in an earthquake in 2001. Even an Internet search is unyielding, with the cups having made their arrival long before the first selfie. Luckily, designer Sandy Nelson, a Starbucks alumna, stashed away a set of these cups, along with other artifacts from her 14 years working in Starbucks Creative Studio. She remembers the design fondly, one of her first assignments at Starbucks. “It was August, and I had just started with the company,” Nelson said. “We were working on holiday creative for the season to come. We had what felt like a hundred cup designs pinned up on the wall. Then Howard [Schultz] came by, looked at all of them, and picked my design. I couldn’t believe mine was chosen.” That first cup wasn’t really red – at least not the holiday red that Starbucks has become known for. It was closer to a magenta, and the cup also came in three more colors: sapphire, emerald and amethyst. The design featured swirls and hand-drawn holly leaves that were flecked with coffee beans. Download video for media use Nelson was in Anchorage visiting a friend when she saw the cups in a store for the first time. “I remember seeing the cups piled high on the counter, and I realized ‘this is big,’” she said. “It was thrilling.” It would be two more years, in 1999, before the Starbucks cup would don its signature red color. Jon Cannell, manager Creative Design, was part of the design team that year. “I remember it all started when the creative director asked us, ‘What is holiday red? Is it burgundy? Is it more of a ruby color,'” Cannell said. “We brought in all these holiday items in a range of reds, and we landed on a red that we all agreed on.” That year, they settled on a vibrant shade of candy-apple red with whimsical drawings of snowflakes, stockings and other images that evoked the spirit of the holiday. “There was a response to that shade of red,” Cannell said. “It was a joyous color, and it really resonated with customers.” Over two decades, Starbucks holiday cups became emblematic of the holiday, with designs that reflect the joy of the season with scenes of celebration and gathering. That shade of red was the foundation for the cups, the canvas for each creation that has evolved over the years. The cup became a symbol of the holidays, the anticipation growing with each passing year. Over the years, online countdown clocks have sprung up as speculation builds on social media. It is now a fixture in popular culture, the star of both morning talk shows and late night stand-up routines. Passions for the cup have run so high that even the design could become controversial, as it did in 2015 when Starbucks introduced a modern two-toned, ombré red design. The 2017 design echoes themes from cups of years past with intimate moments connected by swirls of red and white. But this time the coloring book inspired design leaves room for customers to add their own color. “We’re inviting everyone to color in the holidays in a way that’s meaningful to them,” said Leanne Fremar, executive creative director for Starbucks.

In a Starbucks video, the cup could be found atop the roof of a yellow taxi speeding through the streets of San Francisco. 2006 Vector illustrations that appear as intricate cut paper silhouettes gather in traditional holiday tableaux. 2007 For the holiday cup’s 10th anniversary, customers are invited to “Pass the Cheer,” as a gift is shared in a classic snowy scene. 2008 A field of reindeer and a single white dove are depicted in a moonlit woodland landscape with an overlay of a cozy knitted pattern. 2009 Caramel Brulée Latte make its debut this year, along with a cup design that featured cut-paper ornaments inscribed with the words “joy, hope, love, light, peace” hanging on sprigs of evergreen. 2010 The cups take on a more modern vibe with new holiday characters catch snowflakes in a palate of red, white and of gray. 2011 Carolers sing, an ice skater spins, and a boy and his dog sled down a hill with these holiday cups.

Does anyone actually take this publication seriously? It's clear that Trump's allies at the National Enquirer are once again defending him. 
The New York Times and Washington Post are also guilty of biased reporting, but the National Enquirer at least knows that few people believe its stories. Other publications, on the other hand, pretend to be legitimate journalists. 
Chelsea Clinton is trying to bond with Megyn over this issue, but it's not appropriate. It's unlikely that they will become friends because of it. 
Some people are suggesting that the National Enquirer will create false reports about Megyn, including a scandalous lesbian affair. However, she is not a Clinton, so this is unlikely to happen. 
It's interesting to see how some of Chelsea's supporters are being mean to Megyn because of her past support for Trump. They seem to hold a grudge against her. 
Despite all of this, Megyn shouldn't feel sorry for herself. She has made controversial statements in the past and some people don't like her because of it. 
Chelsea may have hoped for a love fest in bonding over the National Enquirer, but her followers are being too mean to Megyn. Clearly, Chelsea didn't anticipate this response, but we did."

Kris Jenner, Jenner's former wife and the Kardashian family's manager, has allegedly vowed to prevent the shoot from happening. There has been no comment from representatives for Jenner and the Kardashians regarding this matter. Jenner's memoir, written with the assistance of Buzz Bissinger, has caused strained relationships with her former wife and step-children. The memoir also includes controversial claims, such as Jenner stating that Robert Kardashian knew O.J. Simpson was guilty of murder."

Colbert’s slew of frat-boy remarks culminated in a crack that the only thing Trump’s mouth is good for “is being Vladimir Putin’s [expletive] holster.” The naughty word was bleeped in the broadcast, and Colbert’s mouth was pixelated.

Trump called Colbert “no-talent guy.” Colbert’s monologue was plastered by some as inappropriately vulgar, by others as homophobic. The FCC received thousands of complaints. Reporters breathlessly reported Colbert was under FCC investigation, and a good time was had by all.  Today, however, the FCC put an end to the fun, saying in a statement: “Consistent with standard operating procedure, the FCC’s Enforcement Bureau has reviewed the complaints and the material that was the subject of these complaints.”  “The Bureau has concluded that there was nothing actionable under the FCC’s rules.”  In rough numbers, the FCC was saying that programs airing on broadcast TV stations before 10 PM are subject to fine if the commission determines they are “indecent.” Shows that run in late-night, however, have a different threshold: content must be ruled “obscene” for stations to be fined. FCC defines obscene as content that “must appeal to an average person’s prurient interest; depict or describe sexual conduct in a ‘patently offensive’ way; and, taken as a whole, lack serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.”  Here’s the monologue that launched a thousand complaints:",1,en,"The FCC has decided against taking any action on Stephen Colbert’s May 1 Late Show broadcast, in which he treated President Donald Trump to a series of increasingly Rabelaisian insults, in response to on-air insults Trump had delivered earlier in the day to CBS News-man John Dickerson.

gossipcop-900306,"About 10 years ago, at the after-party for a wine auction in New Orleans, a woman in her 20s walked up to Mario Batali to introduce herself. As a chef, she was excited to meet one of the most revered figures in the restaurant industry. When they started talking, she recalls, she realized that he’d been drinking and he became what she characterized as “creepy” — “just giving me this provocative, icky feeling.” Minutes into their conversation, she recalls, he told her, “Come work for me, I’ll pay you double what you’re making.” Moments later, someone bumped her glass, spilling wine all over her chest and down her scooped-neck shirt. She alleges that Batali began rubbing her breasts with his bare hands while saying something like, “Let me help you with that,” as he groped her chest. “He just went to town, and I was so shocked,” the chef says. “Jaw on the ground, I just stepped back from him in utter disgust and walked away.” The chef is one of four women who allege that Batali touched them inappropriately in a pattern of behavior that appears to span at least two decades. Three of the women worked for Batali in some capacity during their careers. One former employee alleges that over the course of two years, he repeatedly grabbed her from behind and held her tightly against his body. Another former employee alleges that he groped her and that, in a separate incident, he compelled her to straddle him; another alleges that he grabbed her breasts at a party, though she no longer worked for him at the time. The woman whose allegations are described above has never worked for Batali, though she works in the restaurant industry. Batali was reprimanded for inappropriate behavior in the workplace as recently as two months ago. According to a spokesperson for Batali & Bastianich Hospitality Group — the restaurant-management services company that provides support to around 24 restaurants owned by, among others, Batali and Joe Bastianich — in October 2017, a B&B restaurant employee officially reported inappropriate behavior by Batali to the company. It was the first formal complaint about Batali, who was reprimanded and required to undergo training, according to the company. In a statement to Eater, Batali said that he is stepping away from the day-to-day operations of his businesses for an unspecified period of time. ABC, where Batali has co-hosted the daytime show The Chew since 2011, has also asked the chef to step away from the show “while we review the allegations that have just recently come to our attention,” a spokesperson said. Batali did not deny all the allegations, saying that they “match up” with ways he has behaved. “I apologize to the people I have mistreated and hurt. Although the identities of most of the individuals mentioned in these stories have not been revealed to me, much of the behavior described does, in fact, match up with ways I have acted. That behavior was wrong and there are no excuses. I take full responsibility and am deeply sorry for any pain, humiliation or discomfort I have caused to my peers, employees, customers, friends and family. “I have work to do to try to regain the trust of those I have hurt and disappointed.

In a statement to Eater, B&B said that while the company has had sexual harassment training and policies for more than 10 years, it will now also enlist an independent, outside corporate investigations firm for any staffers wishing to make claims against owners of the restaurants. “We take these allegations very seriously. We pride ourselves on being a workplace for our employees where they can grow and deliver great service with equal opportunity and free from any discrimination. We have strong policies and practices in place that address sexual harassment. We train employees in these policies and we enforce them, up to and including termination,” B&B’s statement reads in part. “Mr. Batali and we have agreed that he will step away from the company’s operations, including the restaurants, and has already done so.” Joe Bastianich said in a statement, “Right now, I’m just focused on ensuring that our more than 1,000 employees continue to have a safe and positive work environment.” An ABC spokesperson said in a statement, “ABC takes matters like this very seriously as we are committed to a safe work environment. While we are unaware of any type of inappropriate behavior involving him and anyone affiliated with the show, we will swiftly address any alleged violations of our standards of conduct.” Although B&B has been sued for sexual harassment before, Batali’s own alleged inappropriate sexual misconduct has not previously been the subject of a lawsuit. Each of the women who spoke to Eater asked to remain anonymous in part for fear of retaliation — Batali, a celebrated and powerful chef, holds enormous sway in the restaurant world and beyond.

gossipcop-880682,"Was there ever any doubt that Stephen Colbert would use his platform at the Emmys to knock Donald Trump? The comedian has mercilessly jabbed at the president since the campaign trail, honing his voice as David Letterman’s replacement on The Late Show with Trump as his perennial punching bag. (He even got him to respond once.) So on Sunday night, as he approached the lectern to kick off the 2017 Emmy Awards gala, Colbert naturally used his platform to rip the president. There was one surprise, however: a guest appearance by Sean Spicer.  For his opening act, Colbert did a song-and-dance number running through various shows up for Emmys this year, including This Is Us, Stranger Things, and The Handmaid’s Tale. The chorus? “Everything is better on TV”—including, in a slightly more veiled jab at Trump, “treason.” Once he finally took the stage—along with a chorus of dancing Handmaids—Colbert thanked first responders for their work following hurricanes in Texas and Florida. After that, however, he didn’t take long to get to the Trump jokes: “If he had won an Emmy,” Colbert quipped, “I bet he never would have run for president. So in a way, this is your fault. I thought you people loved morally compromised antiheroes. You liked Walter White; he’s just Walter, much whiter.”  “Unlike the presidency,” Colbert added, “Emmys go to the winner of the popular vote.”  Still, Colbert couldn’t leave the stage without finding some special way to hit the president where it really hurts. So he brought out his secret weapon: Sean Spicer.  Although he stayed mostly on message during his recent appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live and avoided dinging the president, Spicer did appear on stage Sunday night behind a lectern to comment on the TV Academy gala’s crowd size: “This is the biggest audience to witness an Emmys, period,” Spicer said with a straight face. “Both in person and around the world.”  “Wow,” Colbert said, “that really soothes my fragile ego. Give it up for Melissa McCarthy, everybody.”  In the room, there was an abundance of shock and a bit of confusion, as some celebrities tried to figure out if the man on stage was the real Spicer. Some seemed unsure if they should laugh.  Will the president respond? We’ll keep our eyes on his Twitter account while we’re not frantically analyzing tonight’s wins and snubs—although we have a feeling whatever response Trump has, it likely won’t come before two in the morning.

Get push notifications with news, features and more. “Bachelor Nation hasn’t seen so many of the important details that make up our story. I thought there was no better way to explain to the people who have followed our love lives for over three years than by filming our own episode of The Story of Us,” Iaconetti, 30, tells PEOPLE exclusively. Adds Haibon, 29: “Our close friends have watched our relationship evolve and understand how we’ve gotten to this point. But people who haven’t been a part of our day-to-day lives ask us ‘Wait, how did this happen?’ With this show, it gave me an opportunity to elaborate more than just saying ‘I’m an idiot.'” Love at First Sight While all Paradise fans know Iaconetti has been enamored with her boyfriend since she first laid eyes on him in 2015, what they might not know is that Haibon also immediately felt a deep connection to her pretty early on. Admitting he was a little freaked out when he noticed Iaconetti frequently “staring” at him during the second season of BiP, Haibon — who thought she was “really hot” — only has fond memories of their first one-on-one date in Mexico. “I remember just being so comfortable with you and how easily we got along … how the conversation just flowed,” he says on their episode of The Story of Us (produced by Married at First Sight and Seven Year Switch‘s Kinetic Content). “It never felt dull … or awkward.” Ashley Iaconetti and Jared Haibon Courtesy Ashley Iaconetti It was “truly love at first sight” for Iaconetti, however, who wasn’t able to fully be herself during the experience. “My interpretation of our first date is a little different. I was constantly scared of another girl coming in and catching your eye,” explains Iaconetti. “I was overthinking every little thing that came out of my mouth.” Though Haibon “dumped” Iaconetti on the show, “I never felt like it was over between us after Paradise,” he says. “I’m not gonna lie and say that I was in love with Ashley during BiP. It was a slow build for me.” Flirty Friendship After their first season of Paradise together, the couple built a strong friendship — but also became the definition of “it’s complicated.” During a weekend spent in Virginia with their friends for a charity event Iaconetti was planning, Haibon saw her in a different light. “I was in love,” he says. “That was such a different experience being with someone in the show and in real life. You were just so down to earth and easy-going, ambitious … sexy. I wanted you that night.” Adds Iaconetti: “I knew that he was looking at me!” Though they frequently hung out several times throughout the fall and were “flirty” with each other, the timing just wasn’t right. Want to keep upwith the latest from PEOPLE? Sign up for our daily newsletter to get our best stories of the day delivered straight to your inbox. The duo met up in Boston at one point and “we made out real hard,” says Iaconetti. But shortly after, Haibon extended an L.A. trip to spend time with Iaconetti, and their relationship took a turn for the worse. After going to dinner and a movie, Haibon spent the night at Iaconetti’s home. “You, like, kind of fell asleep in my bed. We kind of snuggled, but at this time I had to really force the snuggling,” she recalls. “This is when I knew something was wrong. And I don’t know what was wrong still.” Looking back now, Haibon says he just wasn’t ready to be in a fully committed relationship. “Of course there were more-than-friendship feelings for me, but I felt like if there was any doubt in my head, that’s so unfair for me to be halfway in,” he says.

Admitting he was a little freaked out when he noticed Iaconetti frequently “staring” at him during the second season of BiP, Haibon — who thought she was “really hot” — only has fond memories of their first one-on-one date in Mexico. “I remember just being so comfortable with you and how easily we got along … how the conversation just flowed,” he says on their episode of The Story of Us (produced by Married at First Sight and Seven Year Switch‘s Kinetic Content). “It never felt dull … or awkward.” Ashley Iaconetti and Jared Haibon Courtesy Ashley Iaconetti It was “truly love at first sight” for Iaconetti, however, who wasn’t able to fully be herself during the experience. “My interpretation of our first date is a little different. I was constantly scared of another girl coming in and catching your eye,” explains Iaconetti. “I was overthinking every little thing that came out of my mouth.” Though Haibon “dumped” Iaconetti on the show, “I never felt like it was over between us after Paradise,” he says. “I’m not gonna lie and say that I was in love with Ashley during BiP. It was a slow build for me.” Flirty Friendship After their first season of Paradise together, the couple built a strong friendship — but also became the definition of “it’s complicated.” During a weekend spent in Virginia with their friends for a charity event Iaconetti was planning, Haibon saw her in a different light. “I was in love,” he says. “That was such a different experience being with someone in the show and in real life. You were just so down to earth and easy-going, ambitious … sexy. I wanted you that night.” Adds Iaconetti: “I knew that he was looking at me!” Though they frequently hung out several times throughout the fall and were “flirty” with each other, the timing just wasn’t right.

The duo met up in Boston at one point and “we made out real hard,” says Iaconetti. But shortly after, Haibon extended an L.A. trip to spend time with Iaconetti, and their relationship took a turn for the worse. After going to dinner and a movie, Haibon spent the night at Iaconetti’s home. “You, like, kind of fell asleep in my bed. We kind of snuggled, but at this time I had to really force the snuggling,” she recalls. “This is when I knew something was wrong. And I don’t know what was wrong still.” Looking back now, Haibon says he just wasn’t ready to be in a fully committed relationship. “Of course there were more-than-friendship feelings for me, but I felt like if there was any doubt in my head, that’s so unfair for me to be halfway in,” he says. Paradise Part 2 With their mutual friends urging Iaconetti to move on from Haibon, the duo agreed to see other people for their second go on Paradise in 2016. But Iaconetti “came in like a roller coaster,” recalls Haibon. “I’ll never forget that. It was really difficult … I was trying to tell you we weren’t gonna be together because I wanted you to move on [and] be happy.” The drama continued after Mexico, and “we had so many arguments that summer when it was airing,” says Iaconetti. Those many fights helped them build a stronger bond, however, and “that kicked off a solid year of just friendship.” Jared Haibon and Ashley Iaconetti Courtesy Ashley Iaconetti Eventually, however, Haibon went into a “dark hole” and became “really withdrawn [and] almost resentful and angry,” says a tearful Iaconetti, who even had a “daybed” for Haibon when he would visit her in L.A. Explains Haibon: “I think sometimes you imagine like you’re in this rainy day constantly and you just accept that as life. I’m like going after this other girl and we’re going on dates, and yet it’s so much easier with you. I knew that if you and I were to ever date … there’s no going back. Even if I had a two percent doubt about our relationship, then I probably shouldn’t do it because I don’t want to risk losing you as a friend.” Jared Professes His Love Haibon eventually signed up to do Bachelor in Paradise Australia while Iaconetti gave love another shot on Bachelor Winter Games, where she met Kevin Wendt. “I remember I was on a date with a girl in Paradise … and I was just sitting there and thinking, ‘God, I wish Ashley were here,'” recalls"

gossipcop-843074,"Tinsley Randolph Mercer Mortimer joins The Real Housewives of New York City this season with a touch of Southern charm and a whole lot of socialite glamour. Tinsley hails from Virginia and spent her childhood years growing up at Graymont, the Mercer family house in Richmond, Virginia. She then attended boarding school at the Lawrenceville School in New Jersey, where she met her first husband, Topper Mortimer. Together, the high school sweethearts moved to New York City, where Tinsley attended Columbia University and graduated with a degree in art history. As soon as Tinsley landed in New York, her blonde hair, Southern belle charm, and personal branding abilities propelled her into high society. After working at Vogue, she transitioned to a career in public relations. Always an entrepreneur at heart, Tinsley built a successful personal brand that was launched with a line of handbags, Samantha Thavasa by Tinsley Mortimer, and then a clothing collection, Riccimie by Tinsley Mortimer, which was sold exclusively in Japan. Tinsley then became the beauty ambassador for the iconic French fashion design house of Christian Dior and helped to create a lip gloss coined Tinsley Pink.  Tinsley made her TV debut in the season premiere of Gossip Girl and launched a tabletop collection, but when her marriage with Topper came to a devastating end, she decided to take a sabbatical from the fast-paced and overwhelming lifestyle that she created for herself in New York City. A respite in Palm Beach gave her time to reflect on her accomplishments, and in late 2016, after much consideration and encouraged by friend Sonja Morgan, Tinsley decided to move back to New York City. She is thrilled to reenter the New York social scene alongside her friends and begin the next chapter of her life.

Get push notifications with news, features and more.  The singer, 31, shared the news on social media and wrote that she struggled to find the words to explain the disorder she had been “quietly treating” for the past five months.  “Wrote, deleted and re wrote this like 5 times…” Knowles wrote. “Still not sure what exactly or how much I want to share… However it’s so important to me for the people in South Africa, a place that has tremendous meaning to me and that has given me SO SO MUCH, to know why I won’t be performing at Afro Punk this NYE.”  She continued, “The past five months I have been quietly treating, and working through an autonomic disorder. [It’s] been a journey that hasn’t been easy on me… Sometimes I feel cool, and other times not so cool at all.”  Knowles explained that her diagnosis was “complicated” and that she is “still learning so much myself.”  “But right now, my doctors are not clearing me for such an extended lengthy flight, and doing a rigorous show right after,” she wrote.  While the singer did not share what type of autonomic disorder she was diagnosed with, people afflicted with it usually have trouble regulating their heart rate, blood pressure, digestion and body temperature as the disorder occurs in the nervous system, according to the Mayo Clinic.

A former model and actor is accusing Star Trek icon George Takei of sexual assault in 1981. The accuser, Scott R. Brunton, who was 23 at the time of the alleged incident, claims that Takei took advantage of him when he was most vulnerable. ""This happened a long time ago, but I have never forgotten it,"" Brunton tells The Hollywood Reporter in an interview.

New Idea claims that the Legally Blonde star is unhappy with her Australian, Big Little Lies co-star’s failure to promote the HBO series in the run-up to its debut in February, claiming that Nicole used too much of her airtime to discuss her latest Hollywood hit, Lion.  “Reese is furious that Nicole hasn’t done more to support Big Little Lies. All she talked about in the interviews was Lion.

But New Idea suggests that it’s the underwhelming reception in her own home country that has left Reese disappointed. Reese is one of the executive producers for the show after all.  According to the publication, frosty relations between the pair manifested themselves at the Oscars last month. “You could cut the tension with a knife at the Oscars. Nicole was telling her people to keep Reese away from her,” claimed the source.  News of the pair being involved in “some tense arguments” during filming were also reported by the publication, which alleged that the Hollywood heavyweights may never work together again.  An insider claimed, “If the show doesn’t make any waves or get better ratings, it will probably mark the end of Reese and Nicole’s joint ventures.”  However, a representative of Daily Mail Australia says the story is completely incorrect. “Everyone is thrilled to the back teeth with Big Little Lies. They’re (Reese and Nicole) great friends, they love each other and they love the way each other works.”  Another source has denied New Idea’s claims that Nicole had not been promoting the show as much as fellow cast members, saying that the 49-year-old did a ‘shed load’ of publicity both in America and abroad.

gossipcop-852648,"The much-talked about ending of the Gilmore Girls revival left many perplexed, some vexed, and pretty much everyone wanting the mystery to be solved ASAP. Now that we know that the show's final words were (major spoiler alert) Rory saying ""I'm pregnant,"" the question of who Rory's baby's father is has left many fans freaking out, especially considering that the words have always been described as final, meaning the mystery might remain unsolved forever. To make matters even worse? One of Gilmore Girls' lead actors, Matt Czuchry, knows the answer — but he's not going to tell you it anytime soon.  In an interview with The Huffington Post published on Friday, Czuchry (who plays Logan Huntzberger) revealed that he and the show's creators, Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino, know who the father of Rory's child is. ""[Amy and Dan] did tell me who is the father of that baby,” Czuchry revealed. “If they ever want to reveal that, they can do that, but I think at this particular point, I think the purpose is ... to fast forward and say, what kind of mother would Rory be, what kind of grandmother would Lorelai be [and] in terms of whoever the father is would they be in that person’s life. Would it be different from Christopher or would it mirror that completely? Those stories aren’t told yet. I think the fun is for everybody to come up with those theories and play that out in their minds.”  BUILD Series on YouTube  Come on. That's too tantalizing, but alas, Czuchry is smart not to tell us the truth. Still, Palladino and Sherman-Palladino have addressed the final four words and the ambiguousness of the ending themselves before, and whether Rory will become a parent at all is less definite than Czuchry makes it sound. Sherman-Palladino has mentioned that Rory would consider an abortion, and in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Palladino revealed that neither creator had a clear idea of Rory's future. ""There’s all sorts of options for her out there and actually,"" he said. ""Amy and I have not thought at all what would possibly happen to Rory beyond that moment.""  And if more Gilmore Girls episodes come one day, perhaps the mystery of the baby's pregnancy, and Rory's future, will be solved. Sherman-Palladino seems vaguely open to the possibility of more episodes, telling The Hollywood Reporter. “We really had a very specific journey in our minds and we fulfilled the journey... So to us, this is the piece that we wanted to do. And the whole thought about, ‘Is there more, is there more, is there more?’ — this has to go out into the universe now. We’ve got to put this to bed.

Joe Jonas looks like he’s having a blast on the beach! The 28-year-old was spotted surrounded by a group of bikini-clad women on Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia on Feb. 22 — but none of which were Sophie Turner. Don’t worry, though! The girls were just fans of the DNCE frontman, who graciously posed for photos with them on the sunny shoreline. How sweet!

While his fiancée didn’t make the trip, the couple were able to spend some quality time together before Joe’s excursion to the Southern Hemisphere. Earlier this month, the pair enjoyed a romantic getaway to a private island in the Maldives, and then followed up the vacation with a huge celebration in New York City for Sophie’s 22nd birthday on Feb. 21. Joe’s brother Nick Jonas even commemorated the occasion by giving a sweet shout-out to the birthday girl. He shared a photo from Sophie and Joe’s engagement party in Nov. 2017, and captioned the pic that also included Kevin and Frankie Jonas, “Happy Birthday @sophiet You’re super cool! We all think so!” Aww, it’s like she’s already part of the family!  You can also bet that the Game Of Thrones star wouldn’t mind her fiancé posing for photos with a bunch of beauties on the beach. On her birthday, Sophie posted a video to her Instagram story jamming out to “22” by Taylor Swift (as any self-respecting 22-year-old would do on their birthday).

Morning! Here's some of the tea and a biscuit ☕️https://t.co/7I50PYq66Z — KATY PERRY (@katyperry) May 20, 2017  Since “Swish Swish” dropped on Thursday, listeners, including Swift pal Ruby Rose, pointed to the lyrics as a diss track. “I’ve always stood up for the people I love and against things I think are cheap or mean spirited. That’s not new. You have to follow your [heart emoji],” Rose wrote in a series of tweets.  RELATED: Celebrity Feuds: A look at famous Hollywood fights  Perry and Swift have reportedly been feuding since an alleged spat over backup dancers a couple of years ago. Swift’s 1989 hit “Bad Blood” has long been rumored to be a strike against Perry, and when asked by Entertainment Weekly if Witness included a response to the Swift song, Perry said it was “not my question to answer — if it’s about me.”  She further explained, “I think [my new album is] a very empowered record. There is no one thing that’s calling out any one person. One thing to note is: You can’t mistake kindness for weakness and don’t come for me. Anyone. Anyone. Anyone. Anyone. And that’s not to any one person and don’t quote me that it is, because it’s not. It’s not about that.”  Watch her latest explanation of “Swish Swish” on The Tonight Show above."

While regular individuals may face pressure from friends and family to conceive, celebrities endure pressure from the entire world. Amongst famous individuals, Jennifer Aniston has faced the most intense public pressure to have a baby. People are obsessed with the idea of her becoming a mother. Jennifer has been subjected to numerous false reports of pregnancy, dating back to 1999 when she gained fame from her role in Friends and began dating Brad Pitt. Since then, there have been over 55 published articles about her being pregnant, both within and outside of the United States. Surprisingly, during a time when the possibility of the U.S. going to war was a concern, searches for ""Jennifer Aniston Pregnant"" surpassed searches for ""are we at war"" on Google, as reported by the Huffington Post. In initial interviews, Jennifer did express her desire to become a mother someday, which only intensified public interest in her personal life. Fans closely monitored her pregnancy status, perhaps influenced by her character on Friends who became pregnant. Additionally, Jennifer's choice of roles in her career often fueled speculation about her pregnancy. Over the years, the nature of the rumors has changed, but the catalysts behind them remain consistent. Rumors often start when she is seen wearing loose clothing or appears bloated, during the start of a new relationship, or after the end of a relationship. Interestingly, the rumors also evolve as she ages. This article provides a comprehensive look at nearly two decades of pregnancy rumors surrounding Jennifer Aniston and their progression over time."

The 37-year-old entrepreneur recently met US President Donald Trump to discuss prison reforms after she spent months working with her legal team in a bid to get Alice Johnson parole.  Following her meeting with the president, Alice, who was sentenced to life in prison without parole in 1997 on money laundering and drug conspiracy charges, was released from Aliceville Correctional Facility in Alabama.  When asked if she would ever run for office, Kardashian told CNN, “I guess never say never. But that’s not going to be like, ‘Kim’s running.’ That’s not where I am.”  The “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” star added she wants to use her celebrity status for the welfare of people.  “I honestly saw that if I could use my platform just to do something for one person, that it opens the conversation for so much more and for other people to want to do the same thing.  “If more people would just put their personal feelings aside and talk about really important issues that have to be discussed, then so much more can get done,” she said.

gossipcop-5077951266,"The royal wedding is a multi-million dollar affair. Chris Jackson / Getty  The average cost of a wedding for couples in the US and the UK is around $34,000 (£23,700).  Five figures is a huge expense for a one-day affair. That is, unless you're ultra-rich — and especially if you're royalty rich.  Next month, the world will bear witness to the most anticipated royal wedding in years. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are set to be married on May 19 at St. George's Chapel, in Windsor, and will begin a carriage procession immediately after the ceremony. Their reception will take place later on the grounds of Windsor Castle.  Kensington Palace will cover the cost of the wedding, an expense traditionally taken on by the bride's family.  The case was the same for Kate Middleton and Prince William's 2011 royal wedding— the only item Middleton paid for was her six-figure Alexander McQueen dress. Their total wedding celebration cost $34 million (£23.7 million).  Markle and Prince Harry's wedding will reportedly cost in excess of $45.8 million (£32 million), according to Bride Book's estimation. That's over 1,000 more than the average wedding.  The venue is the biggest part of a typical wedding budget for couples in the US and the UK, taking up nearly half of the entire wedding cost. Access to St. George's Chapel — and St. George's Great Hall, where the wedding reception will take place — is free of charge for Markle and Prince Harry. Transportation is also free, thanks to the Queen's fleet of Rolls-Royces, Daimlers, and Bentleys.  The greatest cost for the royal couple? Security. Protecting Markle and Prince Harry, plus thousands of guests and onlookers, will run Kensington Palace a whopping $43 million (£30 million), estimates Bride Book. That includes the cost of snipers, undercover police, military technology, and security drones. The bulk of Kate Middleton and Prince William's wedding budget similarly went to security costs.  Otherwise, Markle and Prince Harry's total wedding spend, including food, cakes, entertainment, wardrobe, and the honeymoon, amounts to about $2.8 million.

gossipcop-9362271023,"(Video provided by Splash News)  The Weeknd instigated his breakup with Selena Gomez, Gossip Cop can confirm. Gomez’s rekindled friendship with Justin Bieber, however, had nothing to do with the rapper’s decision to end his romance with the singer.  As Gossip Cop reported, Gomez and The Weeknd recently split after nearly a year of dating. The pair weren’t seen together much during the summer, though it was later revealed the singer-actress was laying low due to a kidney transplant. Regardless, they still appeared to be going strong in the early fall. Prior to the announcement of their breakup, the status of their relationship was questioned after it emerged Gomez had rekindled her friendship with Bieber. © Gossip Cop (Getty Images)  On Sunday, that speculation swirled as Bieber and Gomez were seen in public and The Weeknd stopped following her friends on social media. That being said, Bieber was allegedly not responsible for the breakup. Rather, it was the challenges of a long-distance relationship, particularly with The Weeknd touring and Gomez’s shooting schedule, that led both the former couple to reconsider their fizzling relationship.  Additionally, contributing to their split, the rapper felt “tied down” in a relationship that had lost its spark. Over time, the pair started talking less frequently on the phone, prompting The Weeknd to end his romance with Gomez, reports TMZ. Despite their breakup, we’re told that the pair are still on good terms and have talked several times since the split.  Predictably, after the rapper ended his relationship with Gomez, Gossip Cop busted the often disproven HollywoodLife for claiming in a made-up report that The Weeknd was “heartbroken” over Gomez reconnecting with Bieber.

Photo credit: Getty I","Ellen DeGeneres, following a significant dispute that ended with her removing her wedding ring, has left her marital home with Portia de Rossi. Multiple sources are suggesting that a high-profile divorce worth $400 million is likely to unfold. The National ENQUIRER has received exclusive information that Ellen has vacated their shared love nest and agreed to sell the estate they purchased together just eight months ago, in a transaction that will not be publicly listed. An insider claims that Ellen made extensive efforts to keep the news from their close friends to avoid inquiries, and that their arguments have become increasingly frequent and escalated into something more hostile than usual. Despite her public claims that their marriage is strong, sources have revealed that Ellen and Portia have been spending nights alone and now appear to be living apart. Property records indicate that Ellen and Portia have maintained separate residences on their six-acre equestrian estate in Montecito, California, which recently sold for $11 million. Furthermore, after acquiring the sprawling property for $7.2 million in September, Ellen discreetly purchased a place of her own in Carpinteria, located nine miles away. Sources suggest that Ellen's recent real estate purchases are not solely financially motivated, but rather reflect her desire to have separate residences as she and Portia move closer towards an official separation. One source states that they spend less and less time together, barely speaking throughout the day. Another insider reveals that Portia feels neglected and mistreated, claiming that she supports Ellen in all aspects of her life while Ellen becomes agitated and judgmental regarding Portia's needs. If the couple does announce a divorce, experts predict it will become one of the most costly divorces in Hollywood history, given their combined wealth, future earnings, and property assets valued at $400 million. A recent photograph of Ellen showed her without her wedding ring during a shopping trip in Beverly Hills, sparking rumors of marital strain. However, in subsequent days, the couple appeared together in public, putting on a show of their ""happy"" marriage, yet insiders remain unconvinced, citing a lack of intimacy between them. While a friend of Ellen's dismisses talk of divorce, sources claim that their marriage has experienced numerous explosive episodes in the past. Concerns grow as Portia spends increasing amounts of time alone in her separate residence in Beverly Hills. The insider states that it is typically Portia who leaves when they argue, describing Ellen as dull and going to bed early every night. Additionally, Portia has allegedly complained that Ellen prioritizes their pets over her."

Jackman even described the process that goes into the filming of shirtless scenes, which he said involves drinking ten liters of water a day in the months leading up to the scenes, which he said are accomplished through dehydration.  “It’s sort of unbelievable to me, what I did for seventeen years,” Jackman revealed. “The first one, I thought you could get into shape in three weeks. The director pushed all the ‘shirt off’ scenes to the very end.”  “You stop drinking water about 30 hours before you shoot,” Jackman said, explaining the process. “You lose ten pounds of water weight.”  But now that that’s over, Jackman is already enjoying himself.  “Now I’m eating and loving it,” Jackman told Colbert. “Sometimes waking up at two in the morning just to have breakfast cereal, and then go back to bed.”  “With it still in my lap,” he added.  One of us! One of us! One of us!  Logan is in theaters now.  (Last Updated )","Hugh Jackman made an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert and was asked by Colbert if we will finally get to see a heavier version of him now that he is done playing Wolverine. Jackman has been portraying Wolverine since 1999 and has had to maintain a fit physique for shirtless scenes in the movies. He shared insight into the process of filming these scenes, which involves drinking a large amount of water and then dehydrating for the desired look. Jackman reflected on the dedication he put into maintaining his physique for seventeen years, initially underestimating the time it takes to get in shape and having all the shirtless scenes scheduled towards the end of filming. He disclosed that he would stop consuming water 30 hours before shooting and lose around ten pounds of water weight. However, now that his time as Wolverine is over, Jackman is indulging in food and enjoying himself, even waking up in the middle of the night to have breakfast cereal and then going back to bed. Lastly, he humorously exclaimed that he now belongs to the group of people who can eat freely. Logan is currently showing in theaters."
gossipcop-888597,"It looks like talk show host and walrus-American Dr. Phil may have made a mistake. And no, we don't just mean catapulting Danielle Bregoli to fame and millions.  No - Dr. Phil was involved in a traffic accident. And the skateboarder he hit might be in for a serious payday. But ... it's complicated.  With the possible exception of a few midwestern grandmas, we don't think that anyone actually thinks that Dr. Phil is infallible.  ... Or the sort of expert to whom you should be listening about the most important things in your life, honestly.  He's just a guy whom some people find charming and folksy and he makes for good television.  Like, one of the statements from his show that's highlighted on his Instagram page is ""Parenting is both a noun and a verb.""  ... Yes.  That is literally how language works. (When a progressive verb is working as a noun, it's called a gerund)  But passing that off as something with profound meaning is more than a little goofy.  So ... you're probably wondering what Dr. Phil did wrong.  The short version? Dr. Phil reportedly hit a guy with his car.  According to TMZ, who broke the story, Dr. Phil's car accident happened when the TV star was emerging from a Universal City parking lot.  This was on Friday.  Apparently, Dr. Phil made an impatient attempt to pass a van, and ended up hitting Terrence Bembury -- a 20-something skateboarder and bodybuilder.  Now, getting hit by a car is most people's nightmare.  Getting hit by a car driven by a guy worth an estimated $400 million ... well, if you're okay afterwards, that's the stuff that dreams are made of, right?  There are a couple of versions of how this went down.  One version, the police account (though it looks like no officers were actual witnesses to the collision), says that Terrence Bembury shook hands with Dr. Phil and told him that he was fine.  (Pro-tip: never tell people that you're fine; an impact from even a slow-moving car can cause injuries that you might not notice right away. Sometimes, those injuries can be very serious. Also, never tell the other person ""sorry,"" even if you do feel sorry, as that can be used against you as an admission of fault)  Terrence Bembury now paints a different picture, posting about being injured.  Right now, we don't know whether he was genuinely injured or whether he suddenly realized that he'd have to be out of his mind to not get any cash out of Dr. Phil.  While Terrence might not benefit from the multiple versions of events, as police say that he had earlier been singing the same tune as Dr. Phil and only later changed his story, he says that he's securing a lawyer.  And, honestly, police have reviewed traffic footage and say that Dr. Phil was in the wrong.  If Terrance was actually injured, it sounds like he might have a real case.  We have mixed feelings about this.  On the one hand, if Terrance was injured in the slightest, you'd think that Dr. Phil would be culpable for it.  On the other hand, we've never understood why skateboarders (or bicycles!) are allowed on streets. If we have to humor people who insist upon riding that awful middle-ground between walking and cars, maybe they should have their own lanes, right?  And then there's the possibility -- though we're not accusing him of anything -- that Terrence is taking advantage of this situation for cash.  But ... we think that most people would, right?  Terrence certainly didn't seek out this situation (no one has accused Terrence of being a mastermind schemer who somehow arranged for this to happen or anything), and it's hard to blame him for trying to make the best out of a bad situation.

Gossip Cop has confirmed that this assertion is false. According to Life & Style, Maguire recently noticed Stone at the luxurious Hollywood hotel and was attempting to catch her attention. An anonymous source from the publication alleges that the actor eventually approached Stone, showering her with cliché compliments and praising her popularity in Hollywood. The same source claims that Stone initially showed no interest but eventually obliged by giving him her number and suggesting a coffee meeting before swiftly leaving. However, Gossip Cop reached out to a trusted source close to Maguire, who revealed that the tabloid's entire narrative is entirely made up and did not occur. It is disappointing but not surprising that Life & Style published a completely fictitious story. In the past, Gossip Cop debunked the outlet's false accusation that Eva Mendes was envious of Stone's friendship with Ryan Gosling. This recent claim is equally baseless."

One is a massive oval diamond engagement ring set on a rose gold pavé diamond band, while the other is a separate wedding-like band stacked on top of the diamond. The oval stone, which is about six carats and of high quality, is an up-and-coming trend, according to Andrew Brown, President of WP Diamonds.

Right before that HOH competition, he had known that that was the anniversary of my dad’s passing, so it was a very emotional day for me. And instead of being a kind and caring human being — because this is just a game — he decided to kick me while I was down.”  “I think that that’s disgusting and I don’t stand by it,” Jessica declared in no uncertain terms about Josh’s controversial bullying. “And I just don’t like him as a person after that.” Jessica was evicted with a vote of 7 to 1, with her live-in boyfriend Cody Nickson being the only person to cast a vote for Raven Walton; Elena Davies received zero votes to evict.

Still emotional, Jessica confessed, “It took half the season of just being attacked, lied to and back-stabbed for me to just give up. I put a lot of heart into certain relationships and friendships that I had with people in that house, and they lied to me several times and stabbed me in the back and let me down every chance that they had.

She also claimed that Kayleigh Morris outed her on social media following the huge fight during Vendettas, in which other women in the house threw Kaleigh’s luggage over the balcony. While Natalie claims she was not part of the “mean girls” moment, as the show phrased it, Kaleigh didn’t believe her, later calling her a “lesbian” on social media.  “She did it in a really malicious way, and that’s what really hurt me. The way she did it. She was saying, ‘She doesn’t even like d—k, she likes p—sy. She’s a lesbian.’ I’m not a lesbian, I’m pansexual,” Natalie, 28, told Us Weekly on the “Watch With Us” podcast. “She outed me in a really aggressive way and kept going. It was really homophobic in a way. To me, that’s getting gay shamed. Then there was a whole bunch of people that started gay-shaming me, calling me a ‘dyke,’ going on my social media and attacking me for being gay.”  Natalie wasn’t ready to come out – and didn’t plan on doing so on the show. In fact, she hadn’t told her family at the time of Kayleigh’s comments. Since, she has called everyone and was forced to open up about everything.  “It’s been a 28-year battle for me,” Natalie said. “I wanted to set a standard because you can’t do that. There are so many teenagers and kids that commit suicide every year because they get outed inappropriately. She took something that was mine and made it her own, and she did it really in a nasty way. Outing someone is not right and I want to set that standard … I wanted to come out in the right way, I wanted to turn it into something positive so that viewers that are going through the same thing that I’ve gone through don’t have to go through it for 28 years.”  Natalie also revealed she is in an exclusive relationship with a woman, who she describes as her “biggest supporter.” After Vendettas, Natalie and Johnny Bananas dated casually while both seeing other people. Ultimately, it just didn’t work.  The former NFL cheerleader added: “She’s a really great fit for me, and she’s really special to me.”  Listen to the podcast above to hear more about Natalie’s journey, what happened between she and Johnny, how it’s been working with Paul Calafiore and more.

gossipcop-886177,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Harvey Weinstein, 66, has denied non-consensual sex Hollywood has been rocked by allegations against film mogul Harvey Weinstein - which first came to light in a New York Times article. Since then, the story has developed continuously, with a large number of women coming forward to say they were sexually harassed or assaulted by Weinstein - allegations he has denied. Here is a summary of the events so far: 5 October 2017 The New York Times publishes a story detailing decades of allegations of sexual harassment against Harvey Weinstein. Actresses Rose McGowan and Ashley Judd are among the women who come forward. Among the accusations are that he forced women to massage him and watch him naked. He also promised to help advance their careers in return for sexual favours. Weinstein issues an apology acknowledging he ""has caused a lot of pain"" - but disputes allegations he harassed female employees over nearly three decades. Weinstein's lawyer tells The Hollywood Reporter his client is preparing to sue the New York Times. Weinstein says he is taking a ""leave of absence"" from The Weinstein Company and is working with a therapist. 6 October 2017 Brie Larson and Lena Dunham are among those to react to the allegations in the article, praising the bravery of those who have come forward. The Weinstein Company says it takes the allegations ""extremely seriously"" and is launching an inquiry. 7 October 2017 Weinstein's lawyer Lisa Bloom announces her resignation, saying she understands that ""Mr Weinstein and his board are moving toward an agreement"". 8 October 2017 It is announced that Harvey Weinstein has been sacked by the board of his company, with immediate effect. They say the decision was made ""in light of new information about misconduct"". 9 October 2017 10 October 2017 Allegations from 13 more women are published in the New Yorker magazine, including three accusations of rape, which Weinstein strongly denies. Actress Asia Argento and a former aspiring actress named Lucia Stoller say Weinstein forced himself on them sexually. A third woman withholds her name from the article, the result of a 10-month investigation by the magazine. Argento says the incident happened in 1997 in the south of France while Stoller, who now goes under the name Evans, says she was forced into a sexual act by the producer after going for a casting meeting in 2004. Mira Sorvino, who starred in several of Weinstein's films, told the New Yorker that Weinstein sexually harassed her and tried to pressure her into a physical relationship. Weinstein's spokeswoman Sallie Hofmeister tells the publication: ""Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr Weinstein."" Hollywood A-listers Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie say they were harassed by Weinstein. Paltrow says she was propositioned as a 22-year-old, while Jolie refers to a ""bad experience"" in her youth. Other figures to speak out against Weinstein include Barack Obama, Benedict Cumberbatch and Leonardo DiCaprio. Weinstein's wife Georgina Chapman announces she is leaving him and that her priority is her young children. 11 October 2017 Bafta says it is suspending Weinstein's membership, with immediate effect. A number of senior Labour MPs call for Weinstein's honorary CBE to be taken away. Prime Minister Theresa May says a decision about the honour would not lie with Downing Street. Cara Delevingne also says Weinstein made advances towards her. A statement from the Cannes Film Festival says organisers are ""dismayed"" to learn of the allegations about Weinstein. 12 October 2017 Overnight, police are called following a ""family dispute"" at the home of Weinstein's daughter.

Police in New York tell the BBC they are looking to speak to an individual regarding an allegation against Weinstein dating from 2004. The NYPD does not provide further details. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the organisation behind the Oscars, says it will meet on Saturday to discuss any course of action to be taken concerning Weinstein. It describes the allegations against Weinstein as ""repugnant"" and ""abhorrent"". Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane addresses a joke he made about Weinstein's sexual conduct at the 2013 Oscar nominations, saying he decided to speak out after a co-star had been harassed by the producer. Police in the US and UK say they are investigating specific allegations from 2004 and the 1980s. No charges have been brought. Rose McGowan says on Twitter that Weinstein raped her. Weinstein has ""unequivocally denied"" any allegations of non-consensual sex in a statement released through his publicist. Amazon Studio chief Roy Price is put on a ""leave of absence"". McGowan has accused Price of having ignored her when she previously made an allegation about Weinstein. And Price has himself been accused of sexually harassing a female producer, it emerges. In addition, Amazon says it is reviewing projects it has with The Weinstein Company. 13 October 2017 Weinstein's former office assistant Lisa Rose says the film mogul tried to invite her to another room, mentioning a massage. The Late, Late Show presenter James Corden makes jokes about Weinstein's alleged sexual assaults at a charity gala in Los Angeles. He later apologises on Twitter, saying he ""was not trying to make light of Harvey's inexcusable behaviour, but to shame him, the abuser, not his victims"". 14 October 2017 The organisation behind the Oscars votes to expel Weinstein following the allegations. In a statement, The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences says: ""What's at issue here is a deeply troubling problem that has no place in our society."" Actress Alice Evans tells Radio 5 Live that Weinstein made lewd comments towards her. Kate Winslet reveals she deliberately did not thank Weinstein when she won her Oscar for The Reader in 2009. ""I remember being told, 'Make sure you thank Harvey if you win',"" the actress tells the Los Angeles Times. ""And I"

gossipcop-3308884181,"Beyoncé Rumored To Be Asking For Silent Delivery  As the countdown to Blueprint 1 and Blueprint 2’s arrival continues, the stories about Bey’s birth plans abound. First, we heard she planned to give birth at home, then they said her security has been running weekly drills to practice their approach to Cedars-Sinai and now there’s a report that Bey wants silence in the delivery room.  According to Naughty Gossip reports:  “Beyoncé likes peace and calm around her. She has zero time for drama and gossip. She likes her inner circle to be soft spoken if they have to talk at all. And you can expect the same will be true when she gives birth to the twins,” sources tell Straight Shuter. “You can only get into her private life if you are invited. She is very guarded and protects her privacy at all cost. She likes to be surrounded with peaceful colors and soft sounds. This will be of utmost importance for her when giving birth.”  This story is almost like opening up a fortune cookie or visiting your average storefront psychic. EVERYBODY knows Beyoncé is private. THAT doesn’t take an exclusive source to figure out.  Silent birth is a real thing though – something that Scientologists practice and Katie Holmes even did when she gave birth to Suri, but as much as Bey loves music we don’t really see her doing a silent birth.  Speaking of Bey’s love of music… Hit the flip for some recently posted pics of her from a Michael Jackson/Prince party.

GettyImages/Instagram","Reports suggest that Beyoncé is rumored to be requesting a silent delivery for the arrival of her twins. The singer, known for her desire for peace and privacy, wants a calm and drama-free environment during childbirth. Beyoncé values her inner circle being soft-spoken and prefers a serene atmosphere. This is consistent with her protective nature, as she only allows those she invites into her private life. It is important to her to be surrounded by peaceful colors and gentle sounds during the birth. While it is well-known that Beyoncé is a private person, the idea of a silent birth is reminiscent of the practice followed by Scientologists and even Katie Holmes when she gave birth to her daughter, Suri. However, considering Beyoncé's love for music, it is unlikely that she will opt for complete silence. On a different note, some recently posted pictures show Beyoncé attending a Michael Jackson/Prince party."

Jenner, 67, completed gender reassignment surgery in January, according to her new memoir, ‘The Secrets of My Life’. The photo shoot promises to be Caitlyn's finest hour since she first announced her transition in an interview with ABC’s Diane Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July.  Although the Kardashian-Jenner clan is said to be ‘wholly supportive’ of Jenner’s transition, sources close to the family say the prospect of a nude shoot is ‘their worst nightmare’.  Caitlyn Jenner, 67, completed gender reassignment surgery in January, according her memoir, ‘The Secrets of My Life’. The photo shoot promises to be Caitlyn's finest hour since she first announced her transition in an interview with ABC’s Diane Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July  Although the Kardashian-Jenner clan is said to be ‘wholly supportive’ of Jenner’s transition, sources close to the family say the prospect of a nude shoot is ‘their worst nightmare’  An insider tells DailyMail.com that the Kardashians learned of the 67-year-old’s plan from her model son Brody, 33.  ‘Brody told them that Caitlyn has planned and booked a full nude photo shoot and they were like, that’s unacceptable, it’s taking things too far,' the source said.  ‘They’re hoping the shoot doesn't come to pass because that would be their worst nightmare. Taking it to that level and unveiling her [new body] with a fully naked photo spread is going way too far.'  Kardashian momager Kris, who is said to have known about Jenner’s surgery in advance, has vowed to stop the shoot from going ahead, according to the insider.  ‘She knew the surgery was inevitable and it was bound to happen,’ said the source. ‘But she says she will do everything in her power to stop the shoot if she can.'  DailyMail.com has approached representatives for Jenner and the Kardashians for comment. Jenner's rep knew nothing about it.  Jenner first announced her transition in an interview with Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July.  The headline-making ‘I am Cait’ shoot was said to have taken the Kardashian clan by surprise at the time and led to tension between Jenner and Kim, 36, as a result.  Nevertheless, the family have been publicly supportive of her decision to transition, which was completed in January according leaked extracts from her memoir.  Jenner wrote of the $20,000 operation: 'The surgery was a success, and I feel not only wonderful but liberated […] I am going to live authentically for the first time in my life.  ‘I am going to have an enthusiasm for life that I have not had in 39 years since the Olympics, almost two thirds of my life.'

Taking it to that level and unveiling her [new body] with a fully naked photo spread is going way too far.'  Kardashian momager Kris, who is said to have known about Jenner’s surgery in advance, has vowed to stop the shoot from going ahead, according to the insider.  ‘She knew the surgery was inevitable and it was bound to happen,’ said the source. ‘But she says she will do everything in her power to stop the shoot if she can.'  DailyMail.com has approached representatives for Jenner and the Kardashians for comment. Jenner's rep knew nothing about it.  Jenner first announced her transition in an interview with Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July.  The headline-making ‘I am Cait’ shoot was said to have taken the Kardashian clan by surprise at the time and led to tension between Jenner and Kim, 36, as a result.  Nevertheless, the family have been publicly supportive of her decision to transition, which was completed in January according leaked extracts from her memoir.  Jenner wrote of the $20,000 operation: 'The surgery was a success, and I feel not only wonderful but liberated […] I am going to live authentically for the first time in my life.  ‘I am going to have an enthusiasm for life that I have not had in 39 years since the Olympics, almost two thirds of my life.'

While the Kardashian-Jenner family supports Jenner's transition, they are not in favor of the nude shoot. Jenner's son Brody informed the family about her plans, causing concern and disagreement. Kris Jenner, the family matriarch, is determined to prevent the shoot from happening. Representatives for Jenner and the Kardashians have been contacted for comment. Jenner's transition announcement and Vanity Fair photoshoot had caused tension within the family, particularly between Jenner and Kim Kardashian. Despite any family disagreements, Jenner's memoir reveals that the transition surgery was successful, and she feels liberated. However, the book has strained Jenner's relationship with her ex-wife and step-children, partly due to her unpredictable behavior. The book also includes controversial claims, such as stating that the late Robert Kardashian knew O.J. Simpson was guilty."

It’s been a little more than eight years since the mother of eight’s divorce from Jon Gosselin was finalized in December 2009, and now, the Kate Plus 8 star is ready to give love another chance.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  PEOPLE can exclusively reveal that Gosselin, 43, will star in new TLC series Kate Plus Date, which will document the reality star on her dating journey.  “I’m nervous, I’m excited, and I’m forcing myself to do this,” Gosselin, who was married to ex-husband Jon for 10 years, tells PEOPLE about the upcoming docuseries.  In fall 2019, her two eldest children — twins Mady and Cara, both 17 — will go off to college, leaving Gosselin at home with 13-year-old sextuplets Aaden, Joel, Alexis, Hannah and Leah. (Collin is enrolled in a program away from home to help him reach his full potential.)  “As we’re talking about Mady and Cara going off to college which is becoming more and more of a reality, it’s gonna happen, it almost became like a worry for them, too, like ‘Mommy, you’re gonna be all alone soon,’ ” shares Gosselin. “But it was very apparent, now that they’re older and talking about dating and how they’re all gonna get married someday … it became apparent: they want someone for me. They want me to have somebody in my life.”  Larsen & Talbert  In a moment of reflection, Gosselin says she “started picturing myself sitting in a rocking chair, knitting, and words like ‘old maid’ and ‘spinster’ started to come to mind, and I realized that no, I don’t want that to be my fate.”  “I stopped focusing on myself — I used to be a runner, and all of these things sort of fell by the wayside, and I sort of forgot about the dating thing,” she says. “It’s never really fit into my life.”  Though Gosselin admits her life is “very complicated,” she won’t allow that to hold her back from the possibility of finding happily ever after.  “If I’m going to date someone, I can’t just go out on a date — it’s creepy to me to think of just going out somewhere with some stranger, and so I actually feel like doing it like this is the best and safest way for me to go on a date — a camera crew will be there! I’ll be safe!” she says. “And the person will have been vetted by a matchmaker.”  For Gosselin, having her dating life documented for cameras is safer — and far less intimidating — than going online.  “I won’t be just doing some scary online thing,” she says. “I mean, online dating, seriously — I put my profile in there and people will know who it is within 90 seconds. No, this is probably the safest way for me to date, let’s be honest.”  WATCH: Story Behind the Story: A Lesson Kate Gosselin Had to Learn the Hard Way  As for what Gosselin is looking for in a match, she’s “not sure,” but remains “open: whoever they match me with, I’m game.”  “I do want someone with a set career, who is confident. A grown-up with their own life, their own agenda, who knows who they are. If someone travels for work, that would be great, because I’m used to being on my own and being self-sufficient,” she shares.  She doesn’t want anyone she has “to care of,” but rather desires a man who is “self-sufficient, who won’t suffocate me.”  The TLC personality asserts that the lucky guy she could one day introduce to her kids “won’t be my kids’ dad,” but rather “would love my kids to have a mutual friendship and respect with this guy and for him to be someone they can ask for advice. It would be great for my kids to have someone they can feel like is a real friend.”  Most importantly, Gosselin says her perfect match “must love dogs.”  “That is such a deal-breaker,” says Gosselin, who frequently shares photos of her furry family members on social media. “People disappoint you, but your dogs never will.”  Kate Plus Date is coming to TLC this fall.",0,en,0,"Kate Gosselin is ready to get back into the dating scene.

The former Real Housewife of New York, ran around the grounds in an A-line Carolina Herrera dress, posing on the step-and-repeat, taking photos with fans, and catching up with old friends. Trying to track her down for an interview turned into a scavenger hunt.  Scattered around the lawn were tables for vendors selling everything from wine to sex toys. There was a station for guests to get a vitamin infusion, with seats in the direct line of the sun transforming the spot into an inescapable sauna-I.V. drip hybrid.

Upon first try to flag Zarin down for a couple of questions, she sent over her daughter, Ally Shapiro, in her stead. Shapiro reflected on last year’s luncheon, when her stepfather was still struggling with cancer, but encouraged her and her mother to party on.  “He loved drinking and partying. This was the highlight of his year,” she said. “It was this time last year that we were told he wasn’t gonna make it another week, and he pushed us and he said, ‘Go to the party. Maybe I won’t be here when you come back, but go.’”  Shapiro, who now lives in London while she works on her master’s degree, admits that she can’t watch old episodes of Real Housewives, which showed her as 14-year-old struggling to get close to her stepfather. “You want to think that it’s like a home movie, but it’s not. That’s not what our relationship was like,” she said, adding that the reruns play constantly in the U.K. “I’m walking down the street and someone’s like, ‘Oh my God, I just saw you trying on a prom dress!’”  She also said that her mother is dabbling with dating, specifically with a man she plays tennis with. “It’s fun, and I live in London so it’s good for her to have a distraction.”  Dina Lohan, dressed in a metallic green blazer and shorts set and a pair of oversized aviators, arrived fashionably late to the affair, but was immediately greeted by hoards of people trying to chat her up or get a photo. Eventually secured in the same spot for more than a few seconds, she was willing to talk about her daughter Lindsay’s upcoming project for MTV, a Vanderpump Rules–inspired reality show that follows Lindsay and the employees of her new Lohan Beach Club. Bunim/Murray Productions is producing the series, the same company that produced Lohan’s E! reality show Living Lohan a decade ago.  “These kids were like, babies, and now they’re running the show,” she said of the crew. “They lived in my house! And now they’re all corporate. . . . We’re home. It’s cyclical, you know.”  Lohan also revealed that the upcoming series is a bit of a family affair with Lindsay’s younger sister, 24-year-old Ali, providing the theme song.  A friend of Lohan’s interjected, asking if Ali, like her older sister over a decade ago, had moved out to L.A. for work.  “She’s in New York with me,” the matriarch answered. “I keep them close! I’m not going to lose someone to L.A., no. Not again!”  Finally, the woman of the hour managed to stop and take a breath.

She mentioned that despite the difficult circumstances, he encouraged them to enjoy the event. Ally, who now lives in London, admitted that she finds it challenging to watch old episodes of Real Housewives due to the portrayal of her struggling to connect with her stepfather.

The MCU is the shared universe in which all of the films are set. The films have been in production since 2007, and in that time Marvel Studios has produced and released 20 films, with 11 more in various stages of production. It is the highest-grossing film franchise of all time, having grossed over $17.5 billion at the global box office. Kevin Feige has produced every film in the series, alongside Avi Arad for the first two releases, Gale Anne Hurd for The Incredible Hulk, Amy Pascal for the Spider-Man films, and Stephen Broussard for Ant-Man and the Wasp. The films are written and directed by a variety of individuals and feature large, often ensemble, casts. Many of the actors, including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Samuel L. Jackson, and Scarlett Johansson signed contracts to star in numerous films. The first film in the series was Iron Man (2008), which was distributed by Paramount Pictures. Paramount also distributed Iron Man 2 (2010), Thor (2011) and Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), while Universal Pictures distributed The Incredible Hulk (2008). Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures began distributing the films with the 2012 crossover film The Avengers,[1] which concluded Phase One of the franchise. Phase Two includes Iron Man 3 (2013), Thor: The Dark World (2013), Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), and Ant-Man (2015). Captain America: Civil War (2016) is the first film in the franchise's Phase Three, and is followed by Doctor Strange (2016), Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017), Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), Thor: Ragnarok (2017), Black Panther (2018), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018), with Captain Marvel (2019) and Avengers: Endgame (2019) still scheduled for the phase. Spider-Man: Far From Home has also been scheduled for 2019, beginning Phase Four. Two untitled films are scheduled for 2020, three for 2021, and three for 2022.

Favreau said that he included the scene as ""a little tip of the hat for the fans...a way to sort of tee up The Avengers."" Jackson was only on set for a day, with a skeleton crew to avoid the news of his cameo leaking.[28] Captain America's shield is also visible in the background of a scene; it was added by an ILM artist as a joke, and Favreau decided to leave it in the film.[29] The Incredible Hulk (2008) After being exposed to gamma radiation that causes him to transform into the monstrous Hulk, scientist Bruce Banner goes on the run and isolates himself from his love, Betty Ross. Hunted by the military, Banner seeks to cure himself and prevent his condition from being weaponized.[30] In January 2006,[31] Marvel reclaimed the film rights for the Hulk character from Universal Pictures after Universal failed to meet a deadline to develop a sequel to director Ang Lee's 2003 film Hulk.[32] Universal retained distribution rights for future Hulk films.[32] Instead of moving forward with a sequel, Marvel hired Louis Leterrier to direct The Incredible Hulk, a reboot.[6] Leterrier initially turned down the job out of respect for Lee, but later reconsidered and signed on.[6] The script was written by Zak Penn, who drafted a treatment for the 2003 film.[33] In April 2006, Edward Norton entered negotiations to portray Bruce Banner and rewrite Penn's script,[34] although Penn received sole credit for the screenplay.[7] Production began on July 9, 2007 and filming primarily took place in Toronto,[35] with additional filming in New York City and Rio de Janeiro.[36] The film premiered at the Gibson Amphitheatre on June 8, 2008, and was released on June 13.[37][38] The film takes place simultaneously with the events of Iron Man 2 and Thor,[39] the former of which is set six months after the events of Iron Man.[40] Downey briefly reprised his role from Iron Man as Tony Stark in a cameo appearance at the end of the film. Downey said that the filmmakers ""were just cross-pollinating our superheroes. It happens to be a scene where I basically approach [actor William Hurt's character General Ross], and we may be considering going into some sort of limited partnership together.

The 20-year-old cosmetics guru — who is expecting her first child, a baby girl, with boyfriend Travis Scott — did not appear in any photos from the bash shared to social media by KarJenner family members. But a source tells PEOPLE she was there celebrating away from the cameras.  “Kylie looked great but didn’t really draw any attention to her baby bump,” the source says. “She still acts like she wants to keep her pregnancy private.”  Meanwhile, her sister Khloé Kardashian, — who earlier this week confirmed that she and boyfriend Tristan Thompson are expecting their first child together — accentuated her own baby bump in a skin-tight, sparkly jumpsuit with a white fur coat.  “Khloé was beaming all night,” the insider says of the 33-year-old Revenge Body host. “She kept touching and showing off her cute baby belly.”  Khloé showed off her bump on Instagram as well.  “Merry Christmas!! May you sparkle and shine this festive season, may all of your wishes and dreams come true,” Khloé captioned a gallery of shots showing her touching her belly. “I pray that we all may feel this happiness all year round.

Kourtney’s ex-boyfriend Scott Disick was there, too — without girlfriend Sofia Richie.  “He mingled, looked good and didn’t drink,” the source says, adding that there wasn’t any awkwardness with Kourtney’s new boyfriend Younes Bendjima.  “Kourtney seemed so happy that Younes joined her,” the insider says. “They are so cute together. He kept bringing her drinks and doting on her. Younes fits right into the family. He didn’t seem uncomfortable that Scott was there. They said hello, but that was it. It was very civil.”  Other guests included Kim’s husband Kanye West, celebrity hair stylists Jen Atkin and Chris Appleton, singer Christina Aguilera and Keeping Up with the Kardashians executive producer Ryan Seacrest.

gossipcop-5865271192,"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired.

T","Katie Holmes, known for her role in ""Dawson's Creek,"" is facing a series of rumors surrounding her relationships with Jamie Foxx, Tom Cruise, and her daughter Suri. According to RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were planning an expensive wedding that would make their relationship more public after five years of secrecy. However, Holmes discovered that Foxx was not ready to give up his flirtatious behavior and his connection with his ex-girlfriend Kristin Grannis. This led Holmes to call off the wedding and end their relationship. At the same time, Tom Cruise has been trying to reconnect with their daughter Suri, whom he hasn't seen for more than five years due to the restrictions imposed by his involvement with the Church of Scientology. Holmes agreed to keep quiet about Cruise and Scientology in exchange for him staying away from their daughter. However, she is torn between wanting her daughter to have a relationship with her father and not wanting her to be influenced by Scientology. Holmes' representative denied the breakup rumors and the possibility of a Cruise and Suri reunion, but this denial is significant as it is the first official acknowledgment of Holmes and Foxx's relationship. Their relationship had been kept secret due to legal obligations from Holmes' divorce settlement with Cruise. However, in 2017, they were photographed together, leading to speculation that the public dating ban had expired."

Foxx kept it sharp in a navy blue tux, and while the two arrived separately, they were seated together and looked incredibly cozy throughout the night, smiling from ear-to-ear all the while.  Image zoom Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for NARAS  According to People, Holmes tried to play it coy at the Gala, leaving the table before Clive Davis announced Foxx's presence. However, Davis pulled no punches, calling out the actress!  “This lady left the room right when I was going to introduce her, she was sitting at that table right with Jamie Foxx and everyone else,” Davis said, according to the source. “If you’re going to sit together what better night then tonight?”  Holmes and Foxx have been the subject of romance rumors for several years, but they've done a great job keeping their relationship out of the spotlight. However, they've been making more public appearances together lately, and we can't help but swoon over their relationship. They make an amazing couple!"

Selena Gomez, 25, is seriously wishing Charlie Puth, 26, didn’t divulge their former relationship.

It’s clear that when it comes to who she dates, Selena apparently is all about maintaining her privacy.  According to our source, it’s only a matter of time before Selena responds to Charlie’s bombshell admission that they were briefly an item — and that Justin Bieber, 23, may have caused the two to go their separate ways. “Now, she will definitely have to respond down the line, and it’s just frustrating when people add their dirty laundry to a situation,” our source added. “She’s learned from the first time dating Justin and The Weeknd that less is more, which explains her relationship with Justin now being much more under the radar.” We reported earlier how Selena and Justin put to rest rumors that they had split by reuniting at one of his hockey games. While they arrived separately, the two of them definitely left together.

Starting Dec. 1, Kim released a new part of the photo every day, and many expected Kylie’s announcement to be included in the final photo shoot. No dice.  [Kylie Jenner still hasn’t confirmed her pregnancy. On Christmas, fans melted down on social media.]  Meanwhile, people keep searching for information. TMZ posted blurry footage of Kylie’s first public appearance since the fall, although she’s wearing baggy clothes. Kylie recently posed for a magazine shoot, but is strategically holding a baby lamb in front of her. Meanwhile, some think the announcement will be part of an episode of “Keeping Up With the Kardashians,” which wraps its current season in a few weeks: The website HelloGiggles reported Wikipedia briefly listed the season finale title as “We’re Expecting!” (The title is no longer listed on the Wikipedia page.)  Today in Creative Ways Kylie Jenner Has Hidden Her Pregnancy for Fashion Jobs: a baby lamb in @THELOVEMAGAZINE! pic.twitter.com/vyu7vmgIdu — Alyssa Vingan Klein (@alyssavingan) January 29, 2018  Should Kylie’s baby arrive this month, it will join new cousin Chicago West, Kim and Kanye West’s daughter who was born via surrogate last month. Khloe and her boyfriend, NBA player Tristan Thompson, are also expecting a baby in March. Although according to the tabloids, you might not see Kylie’s baby’s debut for quite some time.  “She very much enjoys being out of the spotlight and can’t wait to spend quiet time with the baby,” a “source” told People, adding Kylie does not plan to sell any photos of her child. “She doesn’t seem in any rush to get back to a more public life.”  Read more:  As Kim and Kanye welcome baby No. 3, the Kardashian deluge of 2018 has officially started  Kim and Kanye named their new baby girl Chicago West, and the city is loving the attention  Perspective | Here’s why Chicago is actually a great name for Kimye’s baby","Kylie Jenner, who attended the 2015 Billboard Music Awards, has been at the center of recent headlines on People.com. Despite the ongoing speculation and tabloid reports, Kylie Jenner, who is rumored to be pregnant, has not yet confirmed the news. While other celebrities choose to keep such personal matters private, it is surprising for a member of the Kardashian-Jenner family, who are known for sharing intimate details of their lives. The lack of confirmation has led fans to become even more curious, especially since February is rumored to be the expected due date for her baby girl. Kylie's absence from the family's annual Christmas card further fueled speculation. Although there is no official confirmation, TMZ recently released blurry footage of Kylie's first public appearance since the pregnancy rumors began, while rumors suggest that the announcement might come in the season finale of ""Keeping Up With the Kardashians."" If Kylie's baby does arrive this month, it will join cousins Chicago West and Khloe Kardashian's upcoming baby. Despite the public's interest, Kylie supposedly wants to keep a low profile and plans to spend quiet time with her child without immediately returning to the public eye."

Magazine is reporting that the ""Wildest Dreams"" singer has been contacting her ex ever since he has been in New York City starring in the Broadway show called Sunday in the Park With George.  The tabloid is reporting that a source is saying that Taylor is the one reaching out to the actor since she feels she is now more mature than she was when they dated back in 2010.  The source said, “Taylor was so young when they dated, she wasn’t ready for a serious relationship, but now she’s showing Jake how much she’s matured. She’s excited to see where things go.”  In 2015, a rumor swirled around saying that the stars were in contact with each other, even though she was dating Calvin Harris at the time.  An unidentified source told Star magazine that, “He said he owed Taylor an apology for how things ended between them. In June, Jake ran into Cara Delevingne at The Graham Norton Show and asked for Taylor’s new number. They’ve kept in touch, albeit secretly, ever since.""  This would all be so ironic since Taylor allegedly wrote the hit song ""We Are Never Getting Back Together"" from her Red album about the relationship after her ex's friend asked her if they were giving their relationship a second chance.  “This guy walks in who is a friend of my ex’s and starts talking about how he’s heard we’re going to get back together.

The tabloid claims that the singer has been reaching out to her ex ever since he started his Broadway show in New York City called Sunday in the Park With George. It is believed that Taylor, feeling more mature now than when they dated in 2010, is the one initiating contact with the actor. A source shared that Taylor was too young back then for a serious relationship, but now she wants to demonstrate her growth to Jake. While in a relationship with Calvin Harris in 2015, there were rumors that Taylor and Jake stayed in touch. An unidentified source revealed that Jake wanted to apologize to Taylor for the way things ended between them and got her new number through Cara Delevingne. Despite this, it would be ironic if they were to get back together, as Taylor's hit song ""We Are Never Getting Back Together"" from her Red album is believed to be about their relationship. In the song, she sings about their fights, Jake finding solace in indie music, and a scarf gifted to her by her love interest in the music video, reminiscent of one she wore during their time together. Both Taylor and Jake are currently single and living in the same city, making it seemingly feasible for them to reconnect. However, there is no confirmation of this happening, and a close source dismissed the rumors. Do you think Taylor and Jake should reconcile? Share your thoughts in the comments."

The wedding will allegedly take place on a wildlife reserve, wear traditional Cambodian clothing, and serve local delicacies at the reception. “Angie’s thinking of having Shiloh, Zahara, and Vivienne as bridesmaids and Maddox as the groom’s best man since Maddox sort of feels he’s the man of the family now,” the source said.

gossipcop-860400,"Laura Dern in a still from Twin Peaks. Photo: Suzanne Tenner/SHOWTIME A few steps in to “Part Six”, we’re finally given some sweet relief. Not only is a cliffhanger from “Part Four” resolved, but we finally have our first look at Diane some 9,926 days after she was first mentioned in the series premiere of Twin Peaks. The moment occurs when Albert Rosenfield (Miguel Ferrer) ducks out of a rainy, cold night and heads into a sultry bar named Max Von’s, where he comes face to face with David Lynch’s longtime go-to lead, Laura Dern. Now, if you recall, the set up to this began at the end of “Part Four”, when Gordon Cole (Lynch) told Albert that, before they move ahead with their investigation into Cooper’s reappearance in South Dakota, they need to get him in front of one specific person. When Gordon asks Albert if he still knows where this person lives, he responds, “No, but I know where she drinks,” which made me think beyond the shadow of a doubt that they were talking about Sarah Palmer (Grace Zabriskie). Nope. Turns out that Special Agent Dale Cooper’s (Kyle MacLachlan) secretary, who until now has only been seen in the form of a tape recorder, enjoys a cocktail or two herself. But, let’s back up a bit, because there’s a lot to piece together here, including some newly recovered diary pages, which we’ll certainly touch upon.. “Part Six” opens where “Part Five” closed, with an increasingly bewildered Cooper standing near the cowboy statue outside the office complex that houses his workplace, Lucky 7 Insurance. A policeman patrolling the area attempts to shoo him away, but Cooper is unresponsive, tugging at the sleeve of his jacket and reaching out to touch the officer’s badge as if he’s two hours into an acid trip. The cop is nice enough to drive him home and his wife Janey (Naomi Watts) opens the door and confirms it’s her husband. Granted, the fact that she uses her husband’s full name — “That’s my husband, Dougie Jones” — is a bit odd, but the officers don’t appear phased in the slightest, likely because the night itself has been odd to say the least. Soon enough, Janey brings Cooper into the house and makes him a sandwich and even gives him a little bag of chips like he’s a child. She then insists that he go upstairs to say goodnight to his (would-be) son Sonny Jim (Pierce Gagnon), to which Cooper bumbles his way up each step and eventually sits on Sonny Jim’s bed, continuing to munch away on his bag of chips. In a classic case of Lynchian humor, Cooper offers a chip to Sonny Jim, who refuses it, citing his own clean teeth, and slowly places the chip on his cowboy-themed blanket. It’s all so perfectly ridiculous, and also a welcome reprieve from the madness — kind of like the daytime scenes in a horror movie. It doesn’t last long. Almost immediately, Janey screams for Dougie/Cooper to come back downstairs, and then shows him a file folder that had appeared on their front porch earlier, back when the cops brought him in. Inside the folder is a picture of Dougie and his sex worker pal Jade (Nafessa Williams), who he seems happy to see, saying Jade’s name out loud to an increasingly disgruntled Janey, who is sniffing and shaking like a rabid horse. Watts really shines in this role, and “Part Six” allows her to stretch her comically abrasive legs as a woman unhinged yet still in charge, a familiar archetype of Lynch’s oeuvre. As she prods her husband over Jade, Janey gets a call on their yellow kitchen phone, which is, of course, a landline because, again, what is time? It’s hard to hear exactly who’s on the other end, but Janey quickly lets us know it’s the thugs looking to collect on Dougie’s gambling debt, which has led to over $20,000 in debt. Because she’s all kinds of resilient — could you imagine running that household? — Janey agrees to meet the thugs in a nearby park at “noon 30.” It’s another strange detail that’s so oddly funny.

Following this, Janey implores Dougie/Cooper to finish his work, lest he lose his job, and leaves him with his case files. Before he attends to his work, however, Cooper looks over to see a flash message from MIKE (Al Strobel), who’s in the Red Room of the Black Lodge and feeling around in the air with his one arm as though he’s looking for a hidden window. When he sees Cooper, he pleads, “You have to wake up! You have to wake up!” and then, after a beat, he insists: “Don’t die! Don’t die!” The significance of this scene is to remind us, in case we forgot, that Cooper is trapped in the life of Dougie Jones, so that Cooper’s evil doppelgänger can remain on the loose in this time shifting earthy realm. If Cooper dies, then Evil Cooper, still under the influence of the parasitic Bob, will have free reign. After receiving this message from MIKE, Cooper goes through the claim forms he brought home from work and scribbles all over them with a pencil. He circles some things, draws what looks like a ladder, and then presses the tip of his pencil into a few heavy circles. As he’s doing this, pin points of green laser light — yes, the same green laser light that ousted Tom Sizemore’s character in “Part Five” — appear on the pages, and on his arm, as though it’s guiding what he’s doing. Now, comes the aforementioned moment, when Albert makes his way in the rain to meet someone at a place called Max Von’s Bar, whose sign looks a hell of a lot like the neon Bang Bar Bar sign hung outside of the Roadhouse in Twin Peaks.

She’s struggled since Kanye’s terrifying November 2016 breakdown, and she reportedly can’t see a light at the end of the tunnel, according to an insider who spoke to Star Magazine. “Between his raging ego and mood swings, Kanye has been a total train wreck,” the insider alleged to the Star. “Kim is stressed enough raising two kids and getting ready for the baby without Kanye dragging her down. She’s tried to hang in there, but she just can’t take it anymore.”  Poor Kim! We can’t imagine how hard it must be to have a family member — especially your husband — go through such a huge health scare. Of course she’s stressed! If they’re truly divorcing, things are about to get crazy. She allegedly doesn’t want to make any moves until after their third baby, which they’re having via surrogate, is born. As the source says, she’s totally fine raising the little one as a single mother. She’s Kim effing Kardashian!  “[Their divorce] will be all-out war,” the insider told Star. Kim has reportedly asked Kanye to sign a “mid-nuptial agreement” to protect her assets. Factoring in their revenue, from Kanye’s music, the KUWTK empire, and Kim’s various deals, including KKW beauty, it could be a $1 billion divorce!  Don’t think she’s happy about this, though. “This decision is agony for her,” the source said. “She still loves Kanye, but their marriage may be over!” This is so sad, considering what we just learned from a source. Kim and Kanye were happily including daughter North West in the conversation about her new little sister, the source told us EXCLUSIVELY. If they’re truly having problems, then at least they’re putting on a united front for their little ones.  HollywoodLife.com has reached out to Kim’s rep for comment.

HollywoodLifers, do you think Kim and Kanye are really divorcing? Let us know!","There are alleged marital issues at the Kardashian West household as rumors suggest that Kim is ready to divorce Kanye. The situation has become increasingly difficult for Kim since Kanye's breakdown in November 2016, and she reportedly sees no positive outcome. According to an insider who spoke to Star Magazine, Kanye's inflated ego and mood swings have taken a toll on Kim, who is already stressed from taking care of their two children and preparing for the arrival of their third via surrogate. Kim has tried to endure the situation, but has reached her breaking point. It is heartbreaking for Kim to witness her husband's health struggles, and she is undoubtedly overwhelmed. If they do end up divorcing, the situation is expected to get messy. Allegedly, Kim will wait until after the birth of their third child before taking any action. In the meantime, she is prepared to raise the child as a single mother. According to the same source, Kim has asked Kanye to sign a ""mid-nuptial agreement"" to protect her assets, as their divorce could reach a staggering sum of $1 billion considering their combined earnings from music, the Kardashian-Jenner empire, and Kim's own business ventures such as KKW beauty. Despite the tough decision she faces, Kim still loves Kanye; however, their marriage may be reaching its end. It is unfortunate, as a source exclusively told us that Kim and Kanye had been including their daughter, North, in discussions about her new sibling, showing a united front for their children. HollywoodLife.com has reached out to Kim's representative for comment, and readers are encouraged to share their thoughts on whether they believe Kim and Kanye will truly divorce."

gossipcop-919708,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ryan Seacrest confirmed on Thursday that he will return as host of “American Idol,” the most popular music reality show in U.S. television history, when it comes back to the screen on ABC TV in 2018.  After much anticipation and speculation, Seacrest, who served as host of the talent competition show during its initial 15-season run that ended in April 2016, confirmed the news on “Live with Kelly and Ryan” Thursday morning.  “Is it OK if I announce this big news?” talk show host Kelly Ripa asked Seacrest, who was seated next to her. “I’ve been waiting and waiting.”  With a nod from Seacrest, Ripa said, “We’ve been talking about it for a little while, but I am happy to confirm ... that Ryan Seacrest is returning as the host of ‘American Idol,’” prompting cheers from the studio audience.  Seacrest has co-hosted ABC’s morning talk show with Ripa since May.  The radio and TV personality, who will continue to host “Live with Kelly and Ryan” from New York, said he was “very, very excited” about reprising his “American Idol” duties. He will also remain as host and executive producer of his syndicated radio program “On Air With Ryan Seacrest” from Los Angeles.  “It’s genuinely hard to put into words what ‘American Idol’ means to me,” Seacrest, 42, said in a statement. “I’m so grateful for the show and all the career and life opportunities it’s allowed me to experience.”  The show, which was canceled by Fox Television last year, was once a ratings powerhouse, watched by more than 30 million viewers at its peak in 2005-2007.

gossipcop-888939,"Hollywood speaks out against director James Toback after sexual harassment allegations  Celebrities have been quick to condemn the writer-director after he was accused of sexual harassment and assault by dozens of women.  On Oct. 23, 2017, the Los Angeles Times published a report, claiming that screenwriter and director James Toback had sexually harassed at least 38 women (via The Washington Post). According to the exposé, Toback would often explain his Hollywood reputation to women he'd meet on the street, offering them a chance to be in his next film. Then, he'd allegedly bring them to his hotel room and ask them questions about their sex lives. Some of his accusers claim he'd then rub his groin against their legs or start masturbating in front of them.  Toback, 72, has denied these allegations, stating that he'd never met the women or, if he had, he couldn't remember their interactions because their meeting ""was for five minutes."" He also claimed that it'd be ""biologically impossible"" for him to have engaged in such behavior due to the medication he was taking for both diabetes and a heart condition.  It appears that many celebrities had heard rumors of Toback's alleged behavior over the years, and, as such, they wasted no time in slamming the Bugsy writer after the Los Angeles Times article was published.  ""The damn has broke. Women will no longer be silent. We have your back and will amplify,"" actress Debra Messing wrote.  ""One of the main jobs of a director is to create a safe environment for the actors. James Toback is a disgrace,"" Bridesmaids director Paul Feig tweeted.  Guardians of the Galaxy director James Gunn penned a lengthy Facebook post, describing how he personally knew at least 15 women that Toback had harassed or assaulted. Enraged at Toback's alleged behavior, Gunn wrote, ""For over twenty years now, I've been bringing up James Toback every chance I could in groups of people. I couldn't stop him, but I could warn people about him.""  ""James Toback damn you for stealing, damn you for traumatizing,"" Charmed star Rose McGowan wrote.  ""So proud of my sisters for bringing down yet another pig: James Toback,"" xXx actress Asia Argento tweeted out.  As Nicki Swift previously reported, McGowan and Argento have recently come out about the alleged sexual harassment and assault they were victims to at the hands of movie producer Harvey Weinstein, who faces accusations of sexual misconduct by dozens of women in the entertainment industry. After Weinstein's alleged behavior was exposed by both The New York Times and The New Yorker, he was fired from his position at The Weinstein Company, was left by his wife, Georgina Chapman, and became the subject of investigations by the NYPD, the LAPD, and London police.

To make it on the show, you must be 21 or older, be single and can't have been convicted of a felony. You also can't be running for any type of political office. A quiet room, a video recording Women line up to fill out their audition sheets during a casting call for ABC's ""The Bachelor"" at McCormick Ranch in Scottsdale on June 16, 2018. (Photo: Patrick Breen/The Republic) After quite a bit of sitting and waiting, we stood in another line, had a few photos snapped and then were shuffled from the grand ballroom into smaller conference rooms, greeted by a small camcorder and an interviewer. We sat as a small group outside, waiting for our names to be called. I made a new friend, who told me she reluctantly agreed to audition after a friend worried about her love life drove her to the resort. She said her friend even tweeted photos to the producers of the show to get their attention. The empty room was daunting, but the woman behind the camera was kind. She'd been through her fair share of casting calls before"

Anderson Cooper speaks with women who worked at the Spotted Pig, where Batali was an investor and allegedly groped staffers as a diner there.

She later called a crisis hotline and went to a hospital to be examined, but ultimately, she chose not to file a police report. Batali denied the incident.  Police are also investigating another case after the victim reported the crime in March, according to the Daily News. She told NYPD that she had been drinking at Babbo in January 2004 and then blacked out; when she awakened, Batali was having sex with her, the complain said. She believes she was drugged.

Mulroney, also a bridal planner, is assisting Markle in the entire design and concept of the wedding party outfits and look for the reception.  “Jessica Mulroney has a rich history when it comes to ... wedding planning and bridal styling,"" Scobie said. ""It's not just the dress she's involved in. She's actually helping with a number of elements for the big day and I think Meghan is really relying heavily on her expertise and a lot of the decision she has to make, and there are many.""  Harry, the fifth in line to the throne, has ""made himself scarce"" when it comes to the wedding planning, Scobie said.  Tim Rooke/REX/Shutterstock  “Harry made himself scarce, giving the girls plenty of private time to kind of have their meetings with the designers and, of course, choose other wedding elements,"" he said. ""Harry's kind of made it clear that he wants to make this about Meghan.""  The bride and groom have yet to send out formal wedding invitations but they have been telling close friends to save the date.  Geoff Pugh/REX/Shutterstock  Among the high-profile guests who could attend Harry and Markle's wedding at Windsor Castle are Barack and Michelle Obama, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and first lady Sophie Gregoire Trudeau and some of Markle's celebrity friends, including actress Priyanka Chopra, designer Misha Nonoo and tennis star Serena Williams.  Prince William and Princess Kate invited Ellie Goulding to perform at their wedding reception in 2011.  ""Harry has actually put on the top of his list his good friend Ed Sheeran to perform at the after-party,"" US Weekly magazine editor-in-chief Jennifer Peros told ""Good Morning America.""  As for the bridal party, Prince William and Kate's children -- Prince George and Princess Charlotte -- will take center stage as page boy and flower girl, respectively, as they did at the 2017 wedding of their aunt, Pippa Middleton.  ""Another surprise will be Jessica Mulroney's daughter, Ivy, who I heard will be a flower girl on the day,"" Scobie said.  Who is Jessica Mulroney?  George Pimentel/Getty Images  Mulroney is Canada’s best-known stylist. She represents not only Markle but also assists Canada's first lady Sophie Gregoire Trudeau and many members of Canada’s elite.  Markle lived in Toronto during her seven-season run on the TV drama ""Suits,"" which films in the Canadian city.  Markle's much-emulated style and the so-called ""Meghan effect,"" where anything she wears quickly crashes websites and sells out, is largely because of the collaboration and vision between Mulroney and Markle.

Tracking their on-again, off-again relationship has been quite challenging, but luckily, we've broken down every single breakup and makeup they've had.

In November 2011, rumors of their breakup circulate after a Bieber fan claims that she had sex with him backstage at a show and that he is the father of her child. However, these rumors are proven false. The couple officially breaks up in November 2012, supposedly due to their busy schedules. Bieber is briefly linked to model Barbara Palvin during this time. In January 2013, they reportedly get back together, with Gomez traveling to Norway to visit Bieber. Gomez confirms in November 2014 that her song, ""The Heart Wants What It Wants,"" is about Bieber, and they confirm their official split. Bieber denies dating rumors with Hailey Baldwin in December 2014, stating that they are just good friends. Shortly after, rumors of Gomez dating DJ Zedd surface in January 2015 and are confirmed later that year. Gomez opens up about her past relationship with Bieber in an interview with ELLE in September 2015. Bieber reveals on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in November 2015 that several songs on his album are inspired by Selena. Bieber and Baldwin have a public romance on Instagram in January 2016 but break up soon after. Bieber is then seen with Sofia Richie, which sparks outrage from Jelena fans. Gomez posts a clip of her singing a song featuring Bieber's vocals in August 2016, raising eyebrows. In November 2016, rumors circulate that Bieber visited Gomez in rehab after she pulled out of her tour. In January 2017, Gomez is seen kissing The Weeknd, a Canadian singer, leading to speculation about their relationship."
gossipcop-2388806885,"R. Kelly’s time may have finally come. R. Kelly has been accused of sexual relationships with minors going back to 1994, when he married 15-year-old pop star Aaliyah. (The marriage was annulled.) In the 24 years since then, he has been sued multiple times for inappropriate sexual contact with a minor (he settled out of court every time), and he was eventually charged with creating child pornography. (A jury found him not guilty on the grounds that they could not conclusively identify the other figure in his infamous sex tape as a child.) Last summer, he was accused of creating an abusive “sex cult” of very young women, whom he allegedly isolates, brainwashes, and abuses physically and emotionally. Since the story broke, multiple women have added their own testimonies of abuse at R. Kelly’s hands. (Through a lawyer, Kelly denied all accusations, saying he would “work diligently and forcibly to pursue his accusers and clear his name.”) And in April, another woman accused Kelly of “knowingly and intentionally infecting her with an STD.” Her lawyers say they are currently preparing a federal civil lawsuit. Through a spokesperson, Kelly issued a statement to the Washington Post in which he “categorically denies all claims and allegations.” As man after man has fallen to the #MeToo reckoning, losing jobs and retiring from public life after being accused of sexual harassment and assault, there’s been a recurring whisper: What about R. Kelly? Despite decades of lawsuits and allegations, Kelly’s career has marched steadily on. Last year, he finished an arena tour with a few cancellations. This year, he’s touring with singer Charlie Wilson (some protests are planned). His music appeared in Pitch Perfect 3. At this year’s Coachella, rapper Vince Staples repeatedly referred to Kelly as a “child molester” in an interview with Complex, insisting, “He pees on people.” In our post-#MeToo, post-Time’s Up, post-Harvey Weinstein world, and given the sheer volume of allegations against Kelly, it seems reasonable to raise the question of why he continues to work as much as he does. But Staples’s interviewer only giggled nervously and protested, “We can’t ever talk about this guy. ... You’re about to get me fired from Coachella.

His longtime musical accompanist, DJ Phantom, was less circumspect about his decision to leave Kelly in December: “I didn’t know then what I know now,” he said. “He’s a shitbag.” In April, the Women of Color committee within Time’s Up threw its weight behind the #MuteRKelly campaign, calling for anyone currently profiting from Kelly and his music to drop him, including Spotify, Ticketmaster, and Kelly’s record label, RCA.

Kelly that makes it possible to forget exactly what he’s been accused of, how often he’s been accused, and how much proof there is against him. And most likely, that’s because his alleged victims are overwhelmingly young black women and hence apparently easy for America to ignore. “The saddest fact I’ve learned is: Nobody matters less to our society than young black women,” says Jim DeRogatis, the reporter who broke the R. Kelly story. “Nobody.” To try to combat that vagueness and the erasure that it makes possible, here is a timeline of all of the accusations of sexual misconduct against R. Kelly. Much of the chronology here is drawn from DeRogatis’s invaluable coverage of the R. Kelly accusations, including his own immensely thorough timeline. DeRogatis’s timeline covers the entire span of Kelly’s life, including his major career milestones and unrelated legal issues, but I’ve narrowed the focus of this timeline to specifically the sexual misconduct accusations against Kelly. Over the 24-year span of this timeline, a consistent pattern emerges. Over and over again, Kelly is accused of the same behavior: of targeting girls and very young women, isolating them, and controlling and abusing them. And after the dust from the accusation settles, Kelly goes on living his life with very few changes. Here, from Aaliyah to the alleged sex cult, are all the R. Kelly accusations. August 30, 1994: 27-year-old R. Kelly marries 15-year-old Aaliyah The ’90s music sensation Aaliyah was Kelly’s protégé. They met when she was 12 years old, and Kelly wrote and produced her first album in 1993. It was titled Age Ain’t Nothing but a Number. In 1995, Vibe magazine published a copy of their marriage license, with 15-year-old Aaliyah falsely listing her age as 18. “Family members say Aaliyah thought it was all an elaborate ‘game,’ and she just went along with it,” the Chicago Sun-Times later reported, adding that the marriage license was reportedly obtained by Kelly’s assistant, using a fake ID. “Within hours, she realized what had happened, and she went to her family and sought their help.” The marriage was annulled in 1994, just months after the ceremony. In the settlement, according to documents obtained by the Sun-Times, Aaliyah promises not to pursue further legal action because of “emotional distress caused","R. Kelly’s time may have finally come. For decades, he has faced multiple accusations of sexual relationships with minors, lawsuits for inappropriate sexual contact, and charges of creating child pornography. Last summer, he was accused of creating a manipulative and abusive ""sex cult"" of young women, and more women have since come forward with their own stories of abuse. Despite these allegations, Kelly's career has remained largely unaffected, with successful tours and appearances in popular films. However, recent developments such as the release of a documentary and the departure of key members from his inner circle, as well as the support of the Time's Up movement, suggest that he may finally face lasting consequences. However, it is important to acknowledge that the persistence of these accusations has largely been ignored by society, as his alleged victims are primarily young black women. This timeline aims to shed light on the numerous accusations against R. Kelly, highlighting the recurring pattern of targeting and abusing young women. The timeline begins with his marriage to underage singer Aaliyah in 1994, a marriage that was later annulled."

I knew it.”  “Do you want me to go with you?” asks Kim Kardashian West, 38, who had originally wanted to stay in L.A. for a few days so she could attend her 20-year high school reunion.  “No, you come in a couple of days,” Jenner says. “I’m going, I’m bringing the doctor. The only thing that frightens me is that she’s going to have this baby before I get there. And then she’s giving birth alone.”  Jenner rushes out of the room and Kim calls Khloé, 34, who asks whether her contractions should “feel like period cramps.”  “They keep going from different times so I don’t understand if I’m feeling them,” she says. “One was at 9:43, one was at 8:21, one was at 10-something.”  “Okay, I’m going to run and get my bag and I’m going to come with Mom,” Kim insists.  “You know, when there’s something crazy that goes on in our family, we just always drop everything that we’re doing and go be supportive to them,” she explains. “I obviously wanted to go to my reunion and I wanted to make both work, but since my reunion is in two days, it’s like, game over — it doesn’t matter.

I knew it.”  “Do you want me to go with you?” asks Kim Kardashian West, 38, who had originally wanted to stay in L.A. for a few days so she could attend her 20-year high school reunion.  “No, you come in a couple of days,” Jenner says. “I’m going, I’m bringing the doctor. The only thing that frightens me is that she’s going to have this baby before I get there. And then she’s giving birth alone.”  Jenner rushes out of the room and Kim calls Khloé, 34, who asks whether her contractions should “feel like period cramps.”  “They keep going from different times so I don’t understand if I’m feeling them,” she says. “One was at 9:43, one was at 8:21, one was at 10-something.”  “Okay, I’m going to run and get my bag and I’m going to come with Mom,” Kim insists.  “You know, when there’s something crazy that goes on in our family, we just always drop everything that we’re doing and go be supportive to them,” she explains. “I obviously wanted to go to my reunion and I wanted to make both work, but since my reunion is in two days, it’s like, game over — it doesn’t matter. I’m going to go to Cleveland and be there for her.”  RELATED VIDEO: Kris Jenner Struggles Not to Cry as She Talks About Khloé Giving Birth During Cheating Scandal  Khloé welcomed her first child, daughter True, with boyfriend Tristan Thompson on April 12, just two days after allegations surfaced that he cheated on her throughout her pregnancy.  While calling into On Air with Ryan Seacrest this summer, Kim admitted the situation was a first for the famous family.  “Sometimes we were filming and sometimes we weren’t,” she said. “It was more maybe when Khloé wanted her privacy and no cameras when she was in Cleveland going through that, [but] the sisters were still all filming and talking [about] how to approach it and what to do. It was definitely new territory for us when you have a new baby coming into the world. I think ultimately, we always want her to be happy, but it gets all clouded when there’s a baby, you know?  “Her motherly instincts kicked in and she has to do what makes her happy,” she added of Khloé standing by Thompson, 27, throughout the cheating scandal. “So we’ll support that.”  Keeping Up with the Kardashians airs Sundays (9 p.m. ET) on E!"

Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “Which one,” Zolciak-Biermann, 40, wrote in an Instagram Story with two implant size options: “Full C [or] DD.”  Kim Zolciack Biermann/Instagram  “Thx @kanebiermann for taking this pic of me today!!” the mother of six captioned a photo — snapped by her 4-year-old son, Kane — of herself wearing a strapless red bikini while standing beside a swimming pool.  “Lopsided boobs and all (clearly it’s the bathing suit lol) 😂🤣” she wrote. “But thanks you guys for voting on C/DD can’t wait to downsize a little @dr.hochstein 💃🏼💃🏼”    During her House of Kim podcast on Wednesday, Zolciak-Biermann opened up about her decision to go smaller.  “I obviously have implants. I have the largest implants they actually make, but it doesn’t look that big on my body because of just the way I’m built,” she shared. “But, I’m thinking about actually getting my boobs reduced.”  “I already called Dr. Hochstein, who did my boobs and tummy a few years ago — he did my hernia repair and my tummy tuck after that, you might as well! And I said, ‘You know, I feel like I should get my boobs reduced. They’re heavy, my posture’s terrible, I’m getting older.’ What do you guys think?”  “I was thinking of going from like a DD to like a C. So head on over to my Instagram please and vote: DD or C,” she said. “I’ve actually already had my surgery scheduled in a couple months, but I can always change that.”  “I had a lift and I have like the nicest boobs ever. I did breastfeed all of my kids, so ladies, let’s be honest, they were stretched out, loss of volume, pancake nipples,” she explained. “So [Dr. Hochstein] gave me back my 18-year-old chest, which was amazing. He’s the best for that you guys.”  “So anyways, let me know. I’m thinking like a C, a full C. I have to have all my clothes altered. I have to buy a size 6 in everything when I could wear a size 2 in tops because of my boobs and then have everything altered. So it’d be nice to just be able to wear something. They’re perky because I had a lift, so it’s not really that, it’s just the weight of them,” said Zolciak-Biermann  RELATED VIDEO: Kelly Dodd Opens Up About Cosmetic Procedures: “No Pain, No Gain!”  The Bravo star has been very open about her relationship with plastic surgery in the past, including documenting her breast augmentation on her Bravo reality show.  “I will always nip and tuck if I feel the need to do so” Zolciak-Biermann told E! News in 2016. “I’m open about it. I don’t care. You only go around one time, and I especially understand that.”  “I had a boob job and I’ve had a hernia fixed,” Zolciak-Biermann explained. “I had a pretty big hernia from the twins, so I said just do a tummy tuck, which is kinda the same thing, just make the skin really tight. But that doesn’t change my size. I’m the same size I was the day I walked into surgery, I’m just a little bit tighter looking.”  At the time, she also explained that her tiny frame runs in the family.  “A lot is genetics,” she said. “My mom’s very small, I’m tall, I’m 5-8, I do have height on me.

Do you agree?","Mark Wahlberg, who has made significant progress since his days with the Funky Bunch, has a significant message for celebrities who oppose Trump. During an interview with Task & Purpose for his new film ""Patriots Day,"" Wahlberg criticized celebrities who publicly denounced Donald Trump in the months leading up to the election. He believes that many celebrities should not have done so because it is evident that people do not pay much attention to their political opinions. While individuals may support their music or films, they do not rely on celebrities to provide for them financially. Wahlberg argues that a lot of Hollywood is disconnected from the realities of everyday life and the struggles of the average person trying to support their family. He, on the other hand, understands the real world as he comes from it and continues to live in it despite his success in Hollywood. While he appreciates the opportunities the industry has given him, he also understands what it is like to not have all the privileges that come with it. Wahlberg's perspective is valid, questioning the qualifications of Hollywood liberals to speak on politics and emphasizing the need for respect towards the President of the United States. The question is whether you agree with him."
gossipcop-885356,"In anticipation of her next big moment, Cruz had an intimate phone conversation with a friend who has been there since the early days, before she made history: Oscar winner Gwyneth Paltrow.  GWYNETH PALTROW: I was trying to remember when we first met, but I’m afraid I can’t.  PENÉLOPE CRUZ: We had lunch at Madeo in Los Angeles. We were alone and talking about our deepest secrets, as if we had known each other for 20 years. It was around the time I was doing All the Pretty Horses [2000].  PALTROW: Wow. We’ve been friends for a long time. We’ve been through so much together.  CRUZ: And even though we live so far away and don’t spend nearly enough time together, when I see you, it’s like it was only yesterday.  PALTROW: I was thinking the other day about how you used to study dance. Was your goal to become â¨a ballerina?  CRUZ: That’s what I wanted as a little girl. By the time I went to ballet school at age 4, I was already asking to play the role of Carmen. I didn’t realize then that the reason I liked dancing was because it was just another form of acting. I was hard-core, training something like five hours a day, six days a week. But when I did my first movie, when I was around 17, I just fell in love with acting. That’s when I stopped dancing.  PALTROW: Do you miss it?  CRUZ: I miss the freedom I felt when I was dancing. I remember it as some kind of trance. I imagine singing is like that for you. You have such an amazing voice.  PALTROW: It’s totally like that. How did you get your first job?  CRUZ: I got an agent when I was 15, and she sent me to a casting for Jamón Jamón [1992]. And I got the job. For both Javier and I, that was the movie that actually started both our careers.  PALTROW: You were 17 when you did that?  CRUZ: I think I was, but I was lying so much about my age that I can’t be sure.  PALTROW: Most actresses try to make themselves younger, but you were making yourself older.  CRUZ: I’ve spent most of my career trying to make myself older, for different reasons. Journalists have been asking me, since I was, like, 22, “Are you afraid of aging?” That is such a crazy question for a 22-year-old girl or, for that matter, for a 42-year-old. I combat that craziness by refusing to answer the question.  PALTROW: It’s amazing, Hollywood’s obsession with the aging of women. And how much scrutiny we get for being whatever age we are.  CRUZ: My mom worked very hard to raise us, as did my dad, without bullshit. I’ve always had a real sense of rootedness in family and reality. It’s not like I’m proud of the values I have, because I don’t feel like they’re up to me—they just come from the way I was raised. I’m rooted by the things I’ve seen in my mom, the things I admire in her. And in my father. When it comes to talking about aging as an actress, I feel like, “What the fuck? I’m not going to give you even two minutes to honor your question. It doesn’t deserve that.” Something changed when I gave birth to my daughter. I started thinking, “Come on, it’s 2017.

gossipcop-955765,"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle ‘Found Each Other to Change the World,’ Nacho Figueras Says  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s romance is one for the ages, according to their pal Nacho Figueras. The Argentine polo star, who appeared alongside the couple at the 2018 Sentebale ISPS Handa Polo Cup on Thursday, July 26, raved about the couple on Instagram and Twitter after the match, saying their love story serves a greater purpose.  “This girl really rocks. The more I know you, the more I am convinced that you both found each other to change the world,” he captioned a photo of himself presenting a trophy to the Duchess of Sussex. “Let’s push the envelope!! Let’s make the world a better place.”  Figueras, who is also a Ralph Lauren model, was on Harry’s team — the winning team — at Thursday’s match for Sentebale, an organization founded by the Duke of Sussex and Prince Seeiso of Lesotho. Sentebale aims to “become the leading organization in the provision of psychosocial support for children living with HIV in Southern Africa,” according to its website.  Thursday’s match raised more than £1 million for the charity. “@sentebale currently reaches nearly 4,000 young people a year with our unique programme of psychosocial support, so they can live long, happy, healthy lives,” Figueras captioned another photo.

The Argentine polo star, who appeared alongside the couple at the 2018 Sentebale ISPS Handa Polo Cup on Thursday, July 26, raved about the couple on Instagram and Twitter after the match, saying their love story serves a greater purpose.  “This girl really rocks. The more I know you, the more I am convinced that you both found each other to change the world,” he captioned a photo of himself presenting a trophy to the Duchess of Sussex. “Let’s push the envelope!! Let’s make the world a better place.”  Figueras, who is also a Ralph Lauren model, was on Harry’s team — the winning team — at Thursday’s match for Sentebale, an organization founded by the Duke of Sussex and Prince Seeiso of Lesotho.

Here’s how the Biebs is coping with his time apart from Sel.  Justin Bieber, 24, is going through a tough time as his relationship with Selena Gomez, 25, is on pause. She’s currently on vacation with friends in Sydney, Australia, where she appears to be carefree in this new video. However, a source reveals that the same can’t be said for Bieber. “Justin has Selena on the brain constantly. He is trying to drown it out by hanging with friends and doing stuff on his own time but he keeps thinking about her,” a source EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com. “He always wants to be around her, talk to her and be with her. She is like a drug for him, he just needs more and more and more.”  As the Biebs continues to struggle with their time apart, he’s got a few things up his sleeve for when she returns to LA. “He can’t wait until she is back because he wants to really wine and dine her upon her return and really kick start the relationship back up again,” the insider reveals. It’s unclear when Sel is scheduled to return to the West Coast. But, as seen on her Instagram, she is having the time of her life. She posted a video which showed her laughing on a boat, accompanied by a subliminal message, that she “chose” to take care of herself, “not to prove anything to anyone.” Was she trying to give us insight into her most recent split with Bieber?  Jelena fans went into panic mode after seeing Sel in the arms of another man on a boat on March 19. She was photographed hugging and goofing off in photos with Sydney native, Johnny Rays. While all signs point to a friendship between the two, the photos didn’t appear that way to some fans who claimed they looked too close for comfort.  While Sel has been vacationing Down Under, Bieber has been staying active. He’s been photographed playing hockey and soccer with friends. However, his emotions may be getting the best of him as he took a gnarly fall during a soccer game on March 19, and seemingly broke down on the sidelines of a hockey game on March 17.  As you may recall, Jelena reunited in October 2017, after her split with The Weeknd, 28. They seemed inseparable, having spent New Year’s together in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.

gossipcop-28284230,"Not so fast! Madonna was hit with a series of “uncomfortable questions” by a judge before she was granted permission to adopt her 4-year-old twin girls from Malawi, the presiding judge said in court documents obtained by The Associated Press on Wednesday, February 8.  “The petitioner is a professional performer and I guarded myself against the danger of her merely reciting a well-rehearsed speech by asking her some rather uncomfortable questions to which she gave very candid answers,” Judge Fiona Mwale said in her ruling, explaining her reasons for approving the adoption.  After pressing Madonna, 58, to explain her intentions in adding two more little ones to her brood of four, Judge Mwale said she was satisfied that the girls would be in good hands with the Material Girl.  “There is no doubt that the petitioner can offer the infants not only the best education money can buy, but also guidance with a high likelihood of ensuring that the two infants grow to be self-sufficient adults,” Judge Mwale said, adding that she is satisfied that Madonna “is motivated by her desire to offer a home, love, protection and guidance to the infants.”  In the court documents, Judge Mwale addressed prior controversies surrounding Madonna’s adoptions in Malawi. “In determining her motives, I questioned the petitioner at length about the impact of her decision which could be construed as robbing Malawi of its most precious resource, its children,” the judge wrote.  As previously reported, Madonna filed for adoption in High Court in Malawi on January 25 but tried to keep the process under wraps until a final decision was made. (The Queen of Pop issued a statement denying her adoption to Us Weekly that same day, claiming that she was in Malawi “to check on the children’s hospital in Blantyre.”) According to the AP, she has already raised $7.5 million for a pediatric surgery ward at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, which is set to open early next year.  Madonna previously adopted son David and daughter Mercy James, both 11, from Malawi in 2008 and 2009, respectively. She is also mom to daughter Lourdes, 20, whom she shares with ex Carlos Leon, and son Rocco, 16, whom she shares with ex-husband Guy Ritchie.  Madonna’s twin girls will retain their birth names as a part of an effort to preserve their identity as Malawian nationals, the court documents said, and their father was at the January 25 court hearing with Madonna. (The twins’ mother died within a week of childbirth due to health complications.)  On Wednesday, February 8, Madonna took to social media to share the happy news. “I can officially confirm I have completed the process of adopting twin sisters from Malawi and am overjoyed that they are now part of our family,” she captioned an image of herself walking between the two little girls. “I am deeply grateful to all those in Malawi who helped make this possible, and I ask the media please to respect our privacy during this transitional time. 🙏🏻 Thank you also to my friends, family and my very large team for all your support and Love!”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!

She played soccer until age 16 when she broke her hip in a Segway accident.[5]  Modeling career [ edit ]  Richie began modeling at age 14 with a feature in Teen Vogue[4] and at 15 she got her first fashion contract with Los Angeles-based swimwear company Mary Grace Swim.[6] The next year, Richie signed with London-based modeling agency Select Model Management.[7]  Richie has featured in advertising campaigns for a number of brands including DL1961,[8] Madonna's Material Girl line,[2] Chanel,[9] Dolce & Gabbana,[9] Adidas, Michael Kors,[11] and Tommy Hilfiger.[9] She has done photoshoots for Elle and Vanity Fair[5] and has recently appeared on the cover of Complex[5] and Billboard magazine's style issue.[3]","Sofia Richie, an American fashion model, has worked with many renowned brands such as Tommy Hilfiger, Michael Kors, and Chanel, to name a few. She is the daughter of singer Lionel Richie and adoptive sister to fashion designer Nicole Richie. Sofia Richie was born in Los Angeles to Lionel Richie and Diane Alexander. She has a close bond with her godfather, Michael Jackson, and has fond memories of visiting Neverland Ranch. Sofia shares her father's love for music and began singing and playing the piano at a young age. Although she initially pursued a music career, she later decided to focus on modeling instead. Sofia started her modeling journey at the age of 14 and signed with various agencies, landing contracts with brands like DL1961, Chanel, Dolce & Gabbana, and more. She has been featured in magazines like Elle, Vanity Fair, Complex, and Billboard."

gossipcop-880467,"Share Tweet Email Copy Link Copied  Jamie Lee Curtis says in a new interview that she'd happily reprise her iconic role as Laurie Strode in a sequel to 2018's Halloween revival, if director David Gordon Green returns. There's no question that the newest Halloween, which wipes the slate clean with all other sequels in the long-running franchise, is a rousing success. Strong critical reviews gave way to a massive debut at the box office, one of the highest ever in October.  Green's Halloween certainly benefited from a return to the same basic premise as John Carpenter's classic original, trading in decades of increasingly messy follow-ups for a direct line to the Michael Myers that terrified audiences in the first place. The director went back to basics for this one as he avoided the supernatural and went for a renewed focus on the psychological. Clearly, Curtis was happy with the job that Green did, as are theatergoers. And despite the film's commercial success, that's likely not on the legendary actress' radar as far as whether she'd do another Halloween. But the director is.  Related: Halloween's 5 Timelines Explained (And Which Movies You MUST See)  As she explained simply in a new interview with Empire Magazine Australia (via Bloody Disgusting), Curtis says she'd be in for another Halloween sequel if Green takes the helm once again. It's certainly possible, since the original plan from Blumhouse was to shoot two Halloween sequels back-to-back. Producers ultimately decided that making two films at once was too risky. But now, it sure looks like another film will follow, with or without Green behind the cameras. ""If David Gordon Green called me up and said let’s do another Halloween, I would do another Halloween,"" Curtis said.  Producer Malek Akkad expounded upon Blumhouse's decision to keep it to one sequel in a recent interview. Essentially, he found it too ambitious to shoot two Halloween films without knowing how the first one would be received. Well, the next Halloween is reportedly already in motion, but the latest report suggests that Green and co-writer Danny McBride wouldn't be on board for it. That could change, but if Jason Blum is determined to pull a Paranormal Activity and crank out the next sequel in time for Halloween 2019, he'll need a decision from the director pretty quickly.  It's also possible that money talks. Halloween is already becoming one of Blumhouse's highest-grossing films after just one weekend, and it's doing so on a typically tight Blumhouse budget. At over $90 million domestically already, the film has a good chance to ultimately blow by Paranormal Activity ($107.9 million) and Paranormal Activity 3 ($104 million) and settle in at No. 3 behind the studio's crown jewels, Get Out and Split. Green may not necessarily need the money, but it might be hard for the director to turn away from that kind of financial success, especially when he was originally planning to do at least two films anyway.  Still, based on Curtis' comment in her interview, she may not be interested in another appearance as Laurie Strode unless Green is back. It's hard to blame her; Green had established himself as a formidable cinematic storyteller with Stronger, and showed off his horror chops to thrilling effect with Halloween. He and Curtis certainly make a fine duo, but 2018's Halloween may ultimately be the only time they team up.

gossipcop-877012,"Flavor Flav needs money. So says a lawsuit filed in federal court Wednesday, in which Flav accuses Public Enemy co-founder Chuck D and two business managers of cheating him out of royalties and merchandising revenue.  Flav — real name, William Drayton — contends that his Public Enemy royalties have dwindled to almost nothing in recent years. In the last few months, he and his representatives have attempted to get a full accounting of the money owed to him, but have been thwarted.  Flavor Flav and Chuck D were the two core members of the group. Chuck D was seen as the serious musical talent while Flav played the goofy hype man. The suit hints at years of pent-up hard feelings over this perception of their relative importance. Flav contends that there have been many attempts “to minimize his role in the Public Enemy business” over the years, while managers continued to exploit “his fame and persona to market the brand.”  In addition to naming Chuck D as a defendant, the suit also goes after Gary Rinaldo, the group’s business manager since 2008, and Clifton “Greg” Johnson, who was until recently Flav’s longtime personal manager.  Related Chuck D Joins Universal Hip Hop Museum as Chairman of the Celebrity Board LeBron James and Channing Tatum Pitch 'Public Enemy' Lands at New Line  Flav alleges that he has not seen a dime in streaming or download revenue, and that the defendants have licensed Public Enemy’s image without his permission.  The suit states that Rinaldo “entered into merchandising deals for products as disparate as Public Enemy branded watches, dolls of Drayton and bicycles, all without consent of Drayton, all without advance notice or compensation to Drayton.” Flav also alleges that he was not consulted about a set of Public Enemy action figures, which were sculpted in Japan, and has received no payment from the sale of the toys.  This summer, Public Enemy made a new album, “Nothing is Quick in the Desert,” available as a free download for a period of just six days. Though Flavor Flav was listed as an executive producer on the album, he says he was completely blindsided by it.  The suit says that Flav was contacted this spring about the project, and agreed to come to California to record.  “Drayton was in need of money to support his family, and Defendants were aware of that fact,” the suit states.  Flav requested a $75,000 fee. After a day of recording, he was given just $7,500 and told that more money would be wired to him later. He says he went to his hotel to wait for the remaining amount, and when it did not arrive he went back home to Las Vegas. According to the suit, he did not believe that his recordings would be used because they were of poor quality, and was surprised when the album was released on June 29.  “He had never heard of the album, nor heard any of the final mixes,” the suit states.

""It's hard to take off that lawyer hat and put on the other one [to find love].""  Lindsay and Abasolo said they're not rushing to plan a wedding. Right now, ""we just want to bring our lives together,"" the future groom said.  But the two have agreed on one thing: a winter wedding.  “I’m from Texas ... obviously,"" Lindsay said explaining her preference,"" but we’re not rushing anything."""
gossipcop-902055,"Christmas is a time for goodwill, seasonal cheer, and forgiveness, so it seems fitting that the royal family is set to move past some recent rumors to once again celebrate Christmas en masse at the royal estate of Sandringham.  Despite talk of sibling rivalry, tearful duchesses, and diva-like behavior in the court of Kensington Palace, William and Kate Middleton and Harry and Meghan Markle will be together on Christmas Day, the Palace has confirmed. The news comes just after Kensington Palace attempted to snuff out reports of difficulty between the duchesses with a terse comment to The Sun over the weekend.  Although it is William and Kate’s turn to visit the Middletons this year (they usually alternate Christmas between their two families and spent Christmas with the Queen last year), royal sources say that they have decided to join the royal family for Christmas Day.  It is believed they will then head to Bucklebury, Kate’s parents’ hometown, to enjoy a second Christmas with her family.  Kate’s mother, Carole Middleton, revealed in her first-ever interview, published in The Daily Telegraph over the weekend, that she has prepared an extra-special Christmas this year to welcome the two newest family members, her grandsons Prince Louis and Arthur, son of Pippa Middleton.  There will be no fewer than 12 Christmas trees at Bucklebury Manor, the Middleton family’s home, with one just for Prince George to decorate, but the Cambridges will have to skip the Middletons’ traditional smoked salmon and Champagne brunch on Christmas morning because they will be with the Queen and the rest of the royal family at church in Norfolk. It will be the first time the Cambridges and the Sussexes, a.k.a the “Fab Four,” will have been pictured together since reports of a simmering feud rocked the Palace.  It was reported this weekend that courtiers have launched a “mole hunt” to try to uncover who has been leaking stories of tensions between Harry and William and Kate and Meghan. Reports of discord between the couples emerged after Kensington Palace announced last weekend that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex would be moving out of Kensington Palace in the new year and into Frogmore House in Windsor.  Since then it has been claimed that Kate and Meghan don’t get along and that the brothers have fallen out because William voiced concerns about how quickly Harry’s relationship with Meghan was moving.  The Queen, who dislikes any rumors of discord regarding her family, will no doubt be relieved that the family will be coming together on Christmas Day. After the family celebrates with a turkey dinner on Christmas Eve, the sight of the foursome at church on Christmas morning will, courtiers hope, put an end to the unhappy narrative that the couples have fallen out.

His voice as the ""robotic"" Vader, however, was dubbed over by James Earl Jones, who first made the voice famous in the original trilogy.[18] Stock footage of Christensen was used in the 2004 DVD-release edition of Return of the Jedi, where he was inserted to replace Sebastian Shaw as the ghost of the redeemed Anakin Skywalker.[19] This was one of the most controversial changes.[20][21] Lucas wanted Anakin's inner person to return to who he was before he turned to the dark side.[22] Christensen insisted this was done without his knowledge, an act that was confirmed by Lucasfilm itself in the featurette ""Return of the Jedi: What has changed?"" as seen on the official website to commemorate the 2006 DVDs.[23] His performance in both Episode II and III received generally mixed reviews by critics[24][25][26][27] (earning him the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actor in both films).[28][29][30] Christensen was named in both People magazine's 50 Most Beautiful People and Teen People's 25 Hottest Stars under 25.[31] For his performance in Episode III, he won the MTV Movie Award for Best Villain.[32] 2006–present Jumper in Rome in 2006 Christensen with then–girlfriend Rachel Bilson filmingin Rome in 2006 Between 2006 and 2007, he starred in Awake, with Jessica Alba, which tells the story of a man who remains awake but paralyzed during heart surgery,[6][33] and co-starred in Factory Girl, opposite Sienna Miller and Guy Pearce.[6][34] Christensen next co-starred with Samuel L.

gossipcop-3316804883,"Millions of people watched her get engaged to Chris Soules on national television last year, but when former Bachelor star Whitney Bischoff and her fiancé Ricky Angel were engaged on July 15, this proposal was decidedly more intimate.  “It was just perfect,” Bischoff tells PEOPLE. “I was completely shocked. Ricky got me good! I was so happy that I couldn’t quit smiling. My cheeks hurt!”  The 31-year-old fertility nurse met sales manager Angel on the dating app Bumble (“Ladies pick — finally it was my choice,” jokes Bischoff) last September; the couple moved in together in May.  “On our first date, we just clicked,” she says. “It was easy and that’s the way it should be.”  Still, Bischoff admits it was “nerve-wracking” to jump back into the dating scene after her painful split from Soules in 2015, nearly seven months after they were engaged. “I was still a little bit broken and trying to pick up the pieces. But from day one there was open communication with Ricky about what I had gone through.

Ricky got me good! I was so happy that I couldn’t quit smiling. My cheeks hurt!”  The 31-year-old fertility nurse met sales manager Angel on the dating app Bumble (“Ladies pick — finally it was my choice,” jokes Bischoff) last September; the couple moved in together in May.  “On our first date, we just clicked,” she says. “It was easy and that’s the way it should be.”  Still, Bischoff admits it was “nerve-wracking” to jump back into the dating scene after her painful split from Soules in 2015, nearly seven months after they were engaged. “I was still a little bit broken and trying to pick up the pieces.

However, when Bischoff recently became engaged to her current fiancé Ricky Angel on July 15, the proposal was much more private. Bischoff describes the moment as ""perfect"" and admits to being completely surprised by the proposal. The couple met on the dating app Bumble in September of last year and moved in together in May. Bischoff acknowledges that reentering the dating scene after her breakup with Soules in 2015 was nerve-wracking, but she found comfort in the open communication with Angel. She wishes Soules the best and hopes he finds happiness with someone else. While Bischoff still watches The Bachelor, she has moved on from her own reality show experience since meeting Angel. She is currently focused on planning her wedding with him, which is expected to take place next fall. Bischoff remains positive about her past and believes that everything happens for a reason."

And, like many natural beauty devotees, Kourtney is no stranger to its beauty benefits. On top of using the natural oil in her hair, the reality star likes to moisturize her body with it, too. According to her app, Kourtney applies coconut oil to her body skin “right out of the shower” and let it sit for 10 minutes.  In addition, the reality star uses coconut oil in some homemade beauty recipes, too. One of Kourtney’s go-to’s? A DIY lip scrub made with coconut oil, manuka honey, and sugar. The natural concoction gently sloughs off dry skin and nourishes for a silky soft, smooth, lipstick-ready pout.  Manuka honey  Another all-natural ingredient Kourtney Kardashian swears by for skin care? Manuka honey. The reality star is a big fan of Manuka Doctor skin care products and also swears by the all-natural superfood honey for home skin treatments.

You can also add it to homemade beauty product or as a spot treatment on pimples. In addition to being anti-aging and hydrating, manuka honey also boasts anti-bacterial properties that can help combat breakouts and keep the complexion clear.  good morning A post shared by Kourtney Kardashian (@kourtneykardash) on Oct 7, 2017 at 10:57am PDT  Natural deodorant  Like other celebrities and wellness aficionados, Kourtney no longer uses chemical-ridden deodorants and switched to a natural deodorant. “Changing over to an all-natural deodorant seemed like an important thing to do when I heard that when people are diagnosed with breast cancer, they are told to immediately discontinue using conventional antiperspirants and deodorants,” the reality star shared in a blog post. “Although research connecting the parabens and aluminum from these products directly with breast cancer is inconclusive, I like to play it safe,” she concluded.  So, what natural deodorant does Kourtney swear by? Schmidt’s Natural Ylang Ylang + Calendula deodorant. At $8.99 a pop, the natural deodorant is more affordable than other other natural brands. In addition, it features an award-winning formula made with essential oils and free of aluminum, parabens, propylene glycol, and phthalates.

I went out with him on two dates.”  Charles Sykes/Bravo/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty; Robin Marchant/Getty  And as for what Frankel thought of Rodriguez’s lip-locking skills? “I honestly don’t remember,” she admitted.  The pair was rumored to have dated in early 2009 after his divorce from Cynthia Scurtis, whom he was married to for five years and has two daughters with: Natasha, 12, and Ella, 9.  Fast forward to the present, J-Rod is officially a couple.  Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images For Entertainment Weekl  In March, a source confirmed to PEOPLE that Lopez and Rodriguez had “been dating for a few weeks.” The athlete confirmed their relationship status during an appearance on The View, and the pair most recently made their red carpet debut as a couple at the 2017 Met Gala.  FROM PEN: Learn How To Make XOXO Pancakes for Your Loved One  Lopez — who is mother to 9-year-old twins Max and Emme — and Rodriguez have gone on tropical vacations together, dined at a slew of upscale restaurants and recently celebrated Easter as one big family with their kids.  Also on Wednesday, Frankel cleared up more romance rumors — this time with Eric Stonestreet, whom she was romantically linked to in July 2015.  “We met and decided we make much better friends,” said Stonestreet, who was also a guest on WWHL. “But she’s a wonderful kisser,” he joked."

It does, however, highlight the problems with unpredictable pricing, scalpers, and Ticketmaster in general.  The company’s “Verified Fan” program, which they would like you to believe is all about rewarding music lovers, appears to be nothing but a cash grab that takes advantage of Swift-obsessed teens with easy access to their parents’ credit card numbers. People willing to drop $50 on merch, the Post reports, could “improve [their] position in line to purchase tickets.” And, once accessible, the tickets are often too expensive for many fans.  “I paid $150 for my ticket with amazing seats for the 1989 tour,” one fan wrote. “Now for the same seats I have to pay about $500.”  Advertisement  In related news, tickets to Katy Perry’s Friday show in New Orleans are currently starting at $23.",1,en,"Sky high prices are reportedly keeping fans from buying tickets to Taylor Swift’s upcoming Reputation tour, per a story by the New York Post.

While the Post's headline calling the tour a disaster may be exaggerated, it does highlight issues with pricing, scalpers, and Ticketmaster in general.

gossipcop-888650,"AMC's zombie drama returned last Sunday with the season 9 premiere---an episode which marked an uptick in overall quality for The Walking Dead, but still made some old, avoidable foibles that almost look like bad habits at this point. New showrunner Angela Kang has been a writer on the show since Season 2, and it appears that even with improved dialogue and cinematography, she's been unable to shed some of the show's most annoying proclivities. Old habits die hard, it seems. But, like Gregory and a few other characters, they really do need to die. Let's take a look at three big mistakes the show made in its Season 9 premiere, and how each could have been easily avoided with a little more quality control and a little bit more courage. With some very small changes, this could have been a much better episode. Spoilers through Season 9 of 'The Walking Dead' follow. 1. The museum scene. Things got off to something of a bad start when our heroes went to D.C. I'm going to list this as a two-part problem. My first problem with this sequence is a creative disagreement with the show's producers and writers. My second is pretty much just the objective truth. First: An excursion to Washington D.C. to find seeds and other tools should have been a much more interesting, extended story. I think you could easily fit in an episode or two with a small group of scavengers going to D.C. and getting into various pickles there. That it was just one not very good scene at a museum really diminished something I was looking forward to, stripping of it of almost all its potential as an interesting little adventure (which the show has so few of these days.) Second: The museum scene was just bad. There was very little explanation as to why they needed all these heavy objects---surely there were more modern versions of things like carts and ploughs which they could find on farms or in hardware stores. Worse, the entire sequence with the glass floor was embarrassingly bad. The floor itself would not have cracked so easily. That kind of glass is made to withstand a great deal more impact. But even if they'd had it broken to begin with, making it more precarious from the get-go, there was no reason they couldn't have found another way around it. Passing items over the railing would have worked. Ezekiel could have avoided walking the entire length of the breaking glass by simply turning to one side or the other once exiting the stairs. This is a classic example of The Walking Dead's writers treating its viewers with contempt. We aren't that stupid. And neither are these characters. These hardened survivors of the apocalypse should know better---and would know better if they weren't continually written into these same corners over and over and over again. This entire sequence was insulting to our intelligence and had no business being in a premiere cable TV show. 2. The death scene. The second big problem of the night came shortly after the first. Our group, comprised largely of characters we know and then also one other guy named Ken, is bringing the museum loot back to Alexandria and Hilltop when a small mob of zombies shuffles up behind them. This leads to much fear and commotion, despite this being a much smaller zombie mob than we've seen the same survivors deal with easily in the past. One thing leads to another and they decide to all run away and, bafflingly, abandon the horses. In an apocalypse where cars are no longer an option, horses must be one of the most prized---and hard to come by---resources out there. But a few zombies can scare Rick and his band of hardened survivors away regardless. Utterly unconvincing. So when Ken (I think that was his name) runs back to save the horses we know right away he's going to die. For reasons the show cannot provide, a zombie manages to sneak up on him and nobody can get to him in time to save him. Maybe that looked okay on paper, but it didn't work on TV and left us with that bad, unconvincing taste in our mout",0,en,0,"AMC's zombie drama returned last Sunday with the season 9 premiere---an episode which marked an uptick in overall quality for The Walking Dead, but still made some old, avoidable foibles that almost look like bad habits at this point.

The Fix: Now, you can fix #1 and #2 in one fell swoop pretty easily (but it won't fix #3.) Simply have the glass in the museum already breaking when they get there. Have them do everything in their power to avoid standing on it (like actual people with a self-preservation motive would do) but have something go wrong. Maybe there's one last item (like the cart) that they can't get around the glass and they lose control and instead of Ezekiel falling through the glass, Ken falls through the glass and is torn apart by zombies in the most gruesome manner possible. Now we can avoid the bad parts of the museum scene and cut the other scene entirely and we get a more shocking, gory death. Everybody wins! There's just one problem . . . . 3. Using a character we don't know as a catalyst for an important event. Don't do that. Every single significant death in a show needs to have a reason or serve some higher purpose, even if it just to shock audiences. Ken's death in the Season 9 premiere served a purpose, but it didn't connect with us emotionally. It was a catalyst for Gregory's final, fatal betrayal of Maggie. It led him to make a very stupid power play, the straw that broke the Maggie's back, as it were, when he got the blacksmith drunk and convinced him to kill Maggie. The problem? There's no payoff. No emotional weight. Because Ken was not an established character at all. He was introduced just to die. His parents were introduced just so that the father could become Gregory's tool in his latest horrible scheme. This is something we saw happen from time to time"

gossipcop-6225895099,"Chris Soules, former star of ABC’s “The Bachelor,” after his arrest. (Buchanan County Sheriff via AP) Iowa farmer Chris Soules, a former star on ABC’s “The Bachelor” who charmed reality TV viewers with his small-town life, was arrested this week after police said he fled a crash that killed a fellow farmer. Soules, 35, was charged with leaving the scene of a fatal crash, a class D felony, and could face up to five years in prison if he is convicted. The case has garnered the attention of Soules’s “Bachelor” fans as well as residents of Arlington, Iowa, where he lives, who had come to appreciate the reality TV star’s work as an unofficial Iowa ambassador and farm industry advocate. “This story is going to spread like wildfire around here and probably all over because of who he is,” Mary Jo Brown, Arlington’s city clerk, told the Des Moines Register. “Sometimes fame isn’t your friend.” Soules, who also appeared in “Dancing with the Stars” and “Worst Chefs in America,” called 911 at 8:20 p.m. Monday evening to report that he had rear-ended a tractor on a rural road north of the tiny town of Aurora, about six miles away from his home. The tractor veered into a ditch after being struck by his 2008 Chevrolet Silverado, Soules said. The tractor driver — later identified as 66-year-old Kenneth Mosher, a Vietnam War veteran — was unconscious and not breathing, Soules told the 911 operator, according to audio obtained by local media. The man had a pulse, but there was blood around his mouth, Soules said. Soules identified himself on the call, which lasted nearly six minutes, and sounded frantic. Between heavy breathing, he answered the dispatcher’s questions and took instructions. Soules told the 911 operator he did not know how to perform CPR and could be heard asking unidentified people at the scene if they could perform the lifesaving measure. The call ended abruptly after the operator told Soules law enforcement and medical first responders were on the way. “Can I, can I call you back really quick?” Soules asked the dispatcher. “Yeah, you can call me back,” she says. “Thank you,” Soules responds. Soules left the crash site after emergency responders arrived, but before deputies with the Buchanan County Sheriff’s Office were on the scene, according to authorities. Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Scott Bright told the Des Moines Register that Soules fled the scene on foot and later got into a truck. In police audio obtained by local media, a deputy told a dispatcher that Soules “took off” in a red truck. Authorities are trying to identify who picked up Soules in the truck, Buchanan County Sheriff Bill Wolfgram told the Associated Press. That person could face charges, he said. Alcohol was found at the scene and investigators are trying to determine whose it was and whether it or speed were factors in the crash. Soules was arrested about five hours after the incident and booked into the Buchanan County Jail, the Associated Press reported. He posted a $10,000 bond Tuesday morning and was released on the condition that he surrender his passport and wear an electronic monitor. During his first appearance in court, the Buchanan County assistant attorney told the judge that Soules refused to cooperate with law enforcement after they located him at his home.

In 2011, he was charged three times with underage alcohol possession and pleaded guilty and paid a fine for an open container violation, reported the Des Moines Register. The following year, he received three citations for fighting and noise, unlawful use of a license and leaving the scene, which was amended down to defective brakes, court documents showed. Then in 2005, Soules was charged with driving while intoxicated and received one year of probation. A statement from Soules’s publicist earlier this week said he was “devastated” to learn that Mosher had died from the crash and that his “thoughts and prayers” were with the man’s family. Mosher, a lifelong resident of Aurora — population 200 — lived on his family farm near the crash site, reported the Argus Leader. He was married to his high school sweetheart, Nancy, and the couple had two sons and three grandchildren, according to Mosher’s obituary. An Army veteran, Mosher served six years, including a tour in Vietnam. He farmed his entire life and was a member of the Aurora American Legion and the Iowa Corn Growers Association. “Kenny loved playing golf, farming and spending his winters in Florida biking and visiting his mother,” Mosher’s obituary said. “His family was most important to him, especially his grandchildren.” In northeast Iowa, where Mosher and Soules both farmed, community members told local media they were heartbroken for the families of both men.

He believes that he has learned from his previous two marriages and that he is a firm believer in marriage counseling to resolve any problems that may arise. Brolin also understands the importance of not interrupting Streisand during busy times, respecting her focus and prioritizing her needs. Streisand, on the other hand, makes him feel special by eagerly welcoming him home and planning surprises for him."

Despite looking youthful, her loved ones are tired of her constantly showcasing her perfection. Moreover, Heidi's attempts to appear normal, such as pretending to eat junk food on camera, are also annoying to people. Interestingly, she hasn't consumed a burger in years. Despite spending time in Italy recently, it remains unclear how she managed to avoid pasta and pizza. It seems that all Heidi talks about is her workouts and minimal food intake, which primarily consists of nuts and steamed kale. Overall, it doesn't sound enjoyable."

gossipcop-858931,"The Leftovers has closed the book on its final chapter. The HBO drama from Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta aired its finale Sunday night, and it did so by offering more closure than most viewers had been trained to anticipate — not only for all the major characters but even for the show's biggest mystery. (Note: spoilers abound below, so proceed with caution if you haven’t yet watched ""The Book of Nora."") Lindelof had long tempered expectations about the finale, telling The Hollywood Reporter last year when he was writing the final script that The Leftovers is in no way a mystery-solving show. ""If the takeaway from Lost was that there was a disgruntled portion of the fan base that said, 'You did not give satisfactory answers to the mysteries,' then I feel somewhat liberated with The Leftovers because that’s off the table,"" he said at the time. But in an emotional monologue that concludes the third and final season of the thought-provoking drama, Carrie Coon's character Nora Durst actually provides one possible answer to what happened to the 2 percent of the population that suddenly departed years ago. Whether or not she's telling the truth is up for debate. Seated across from an aged Kevin (Justin Theroux), Nora explains that years earlier she got into a machine that transported her to a parallel earth where the departed now live. It was the closure she'd always longed for — except that when she found her three children and husband, it was apparent that they were happy and had moved on with their lives. Realizing there was no place for her in their world, she had the creator of the machine send her back home. ""I knew that if I told you what happened that you would never believe me,"" Nora tells Kevin as she finishes her poignant tale. ""I believe you,"" Kevin assures her, tears streaming down his face. ""You do?"" she asks incredulously. ""Why wouldn't I believe you? You're here,"" he responds before reaching out to grab his former wife's hand. ""I'm here,"" Nora echoes, her mouth slowing turning upward into a smile. And with that, The Leftovers concluded its story, leaving the credibility of Nora's account open to interpretation. ""I definitely feel like there are going to be people out there who watch the show who don’t believe her story,"" says Lindelof, ""and then for a lot of people, it won’t even occur to them to disbelieve it."" Ahead of the finale's debut, THR chatted with Lindelof about why not revealing the fates of certain characters would be a ""travesty,"" the questions he doesn't want to have to answer about the finale and whether or not he personally believes Nora (hint: he really wants to). Now that people have gotten a chance to watch the finale, what's the most surprising question you're getting about it? I can’t explain why it is surprising to me — I mean, I could explain it but I’m not going to — is why didn't we show the story that Nora is telling as she’s telling it? Was that ever a consideration in the writers room? It was something that was discussed very early on when we first were talking about the ending of the series, but once the storytelling process began and scripts started getting written, we landed on the idea of this season, if not the series, being about people telling stories. And, more important, people telling stories that would either give themselves a degree of comfort or that they believed would give comfort to others. That tradition goes all the way back to season one with Matt at the pulpit, and in season two, with Tom [Chris Zylka] speaking in front of the ex-guilty members like AA meetings, saying that he can give magic hugs. So, there’s always been a tradition on the show of characters delivering monologues that are fantastical or believable or unbelievable stories, with themselves at the center of those stories.

They’re told in the first person, and it was sort of like, “Oh, yeah, how could we not end the series with Carrie Coon doing that?"" When did you know that this is how you wanted to end the show? Very early on. The holdover writers from season two got together in January, and all we talked about was, “What’s the last scene of the finale, and when and where does the finale take place? And what are the things we want to resolve definitively, and what are the things that we’re OK not resolving definitively, etc.” They were both esoteric, enthymematic conversations and then they became much more directed toward the scene we ended up with and we explored different permutations. It was always going to be that Nora tells the story of going through, but there were a couple different permutations of who she was telling that story to — and then it became very obvious to us that it had to be Kevin. That was locked in before we even started breaking the season premiere. Who were the others that you considered for her telling the story to? Erika Murphy was a contender, and then a grown-up version of Lily who would be maybe a 19- or 20-year-old young woman at the time that this would be taking place. Those were really the only other two contenders, other than Kevin. And how did you land on it being Kevin? Well, it isn’t to say that Kevin isn’t an incredibly important character in The Leftovers — of course he is — but I think the idea is that the third and final season was just as much about Nora’s journey as it was about Kevin’s. His journey would resolve in the penultimate episode and then her journey would resolve in the finale. And that’s inevitable for us because she just lost so much more. He’s been suffering in this kind of existential way. He feels like he’s a coward and he feels like he"

gossipcop-904068,"Multiple women have accused Oscar-winning movie director Paul Haggis of sexual assault. Last month, publicist Haleigh Breest filed a civil suit alleging that the filmmaker, who picked up Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay Academy Awards for 2004’s Crash, of rape. On Friday, three other women came forward to The Associated Press with accusations of sexual misconduct.  Haggis denied the claims in Breest’s suit, which was filed in mid-December, and filed a countersuit, claiming the publicist and her lawyer had attempted to extort $9 million from him in exchange for withholding her suit. Breest claimed that Haggis assaulted her in 2013 after he offered her a ride home after an event, but instead took her to his Manhattan apartment; there, she said, he forced her to perform oral sex on him, fondled her, asked if she enjoyed anal sex and raped her. Haggis’ lawyer, Christine Lepera – who represented producer Dr. Luke in the wake of pop-star Kesha accusing him of sexual assault – said, “He didn’t rape anybody,” in a statement.  “Mr. Haggis denies these anonymous claims in whole. In a society where one of a person’s fundamental rights is the ability to confront an accuser, that right has now been eviscerated when it comes to anyone being charged in the press with any sort of sexual misconduct,” a rep for Haggis said in a statement to Rolling Stone. “Notably, no one has reached out to anyone on Mr. Haggis’ team other than the press to report this. He views the fact that these reports appear to be spearheaded from the law firm representing Ms. Breest, as a further tactic to try to harm him and continue their effort to obtain money … We reiterate our claim against Ms. Breest, and note again that we initiated the legal proceedings, not Ms. Breest.”  The new accusers said they felt empowered to come forward after learning of Breest’s story and seeing women report stories of powerful men engaging in sexual misconduct as part of the #MeToo movement. The women, who all chose to remain anonymous out of fear of retribution, claimed to have stories similar to Breest’s: they were all in their 20s or early 30s and they all said Haggis allegedly attempted to set up private meetings with them to discuss business but subsequently tried to kiss them. Two said that Haggis allegedly became more antagonistic when they resisted him.  A lawyer for Breest did not immediately reply to Rolling Stone‘s request for comment but told The AP that Haggis’ countersuit was “a preposterous and transparent PR stunt that will not succeed” and “a further act of aggression.”  One of the new accusers said she was 28 when the alleged attack took place in 1996. She claims she was working on a television show that Haggis produced when he asked her to review some photos from the show. When they met in a back office, she claimed he tried to kiss her. “He said, ‘Do you really want to continue working?'” she claimed. He then allegedly forced her to perform oral sex on him and pushed her onto the floor and raped her.  Another new accuser said she was in her 30s in the late 2000s when she set up a meeting with Haggis to pitch him on a TV show. She said that Haggis told her that he and his wife had an understanding about extramarital sex and came around a table attempting to kiss her. She ran to her car as Haggis allegedly pursued her, though she was able to drive away.  The last new accuser said she was in her late 20s in 2015 when Haggis allegedly held down her arms, kissed her and followed her into a taxi in Canada. When the cab took her to her apartment, she said Haggis allegedly tossed money at the driver, pursued her and kissed her again before she could get inside and close the door. She said that he then waved at her from outside her residence and claimed that he sent aggressive text messages over the next 24 hours until she blocked him.

During the lengthy interview on her new movie Mother!, the conversation turned political about halfway through. After discussing the alleged pay gap between men and women, the interviewer asked Lawrence about climate change and the political climate in America.  “I mean when the director was asked about the film, why it was so dark, he said, ‘It’s a mad time to be alive.’ And there is certainly an end of days feeling about it. For many people, in America who would say, [grimaces] perhaps it’s truer there at the moment than anywhere else,” the Channel 4 reporter prompted Lawrence to comment.  “It’s scary,” she responded. “You know, it’s this new language that’s forming, I don’t even recognize it. It’s also scary to know, that climate change is due to human activity, and we continue to ignore it, and the only voice that we really have is through voting,” Lawrence stated.  “And you have voted very recently, as a country” the interviewer acknowledged.  “And we voted, and it was really startling,” Lawrence added. She then insinuated that the hurricanes were “Mother Nature’s rage and wrath” at America for Trump.  “You know you’re watching these hurricanes now, and it’s really hard especially while promoting this movie, not to feel mother nature’s rage and wrath,” she stated.  “It’s not just about climate change though is it, in America? It seems to be a time of huge division,” the reporter added.  “Yeah, it’s really polarizing and upsetting. You know I’ve heard things and seen things on T.V. in my own country that devastate me and make me sick, and it’s just really confusing,” Lawrence stated.  “Do you find President Trump confusing?” the reporter pressed further.  “I don’t find him confusing. I think I know exactly what he is,” Lawrence said solemnly before smirking.  Wrapping up the interview, the reporter asked Lawrence how she felt about the future.

Good luck with that","According to a post from a guest on June 14, 2009 at 3:22 pm, things took a turn for the worse after Jen attended the Academy Awards show and smiled at Brad Pitt, causing Angelina Jolie to distance Brad from Jen. Angelina's constant traveling was an attempt to keep Brad away from anyone she perceived as a friend. She doesn't want anyone else to have a relationship with Brad, including his own family. The writer believes that Angelina's actions would eventually backfire and questions why it took Brad so long to realize her manipulative behavior. The writer suggests that Angelina suffers from a mental illness and doesn't have their children in school for similar reasons. They think she believed her relationship with Brad would last because she considers herself attractive and thinks men should do as she says. The treatment of her surrogate, Holly, made Brad see Angelina's true nature. The writer also points out that Angelina still talks to her exes, despite expecting Brad not to communicate with Jen. Brad's friends being women bothers Angelina, and she broke her promise to stay home and be a mother by taking on a salt role. It is mentioned how little time Angelina spends bonding with their twin babies. The writer implies that the only reason Brad hasn't finalized a separation is because of the kids. Lastly, the writer warns Angelina to be careful, as it seems like their six children will end up without both parents in one place."

WATCH: De Niro’s past criticism of Donald Trump  “I agree,” Kushner said when asked about the De Niro moment, dropping an F-bomb of his own in relation to the president.  “I can’t believe De Niro did that,” Kushner said. “Good for him. I mean, it’s Robert De Niro. Who’s gonna argue with him?”  Kushner went even further, calling Trump’s presidency “the Hitler mistake” that put a “borderline psychotic narcissist in the White House.”"

There comes a time in every couple's relationship when the question of moving in together becomes impossible to ignore. And when those two lovebirds have been stepping out for 15 months — even though they live 3,500 miles apart; he in the UK, she in Canada — it's not so much a case of 'if' as of 'when' they will settle down. So it comes as no surprise that Prince Harry, 33, and his actress girlfriend Meghan Markle, 36, are said to be house-hunting. £7.25million - North Aston Manor, Oxfordshire: This eight bedroom property, overlooking the stunning Cherwell Valley, has seven reception rooms, a spa, swimming pool and 18.2 acres with equestrian facilities. It's nine miles from Soho Farmhouse and swanky shopping centre Bicester Village, should Meghan fancy snapping up some designer bargains Prince Harry and actress girlfriend Meghan Markle were pictured together at the Invictus Games in Toronto last month Royal sources have exclusively told the Daily Mail that the royal couple are looking in Oxfordshire and are particularly interested in high-end properties tucked away in the rolling Cotswold hills. A good friend of Harry's says the Prince, whose father's residence, Highgrove House, is in the south Cotswolds, has a long-standing affection for the area, while Meghan is said to be entranced by its rustic charm. 'He is searching for a new home in the area,' the friend reveals. 'Before Meghan, he was vaguely looking in Norfolk, but didn't find what he wanted. Now, with her input, he's renewed his search.' £2million - The Old Rectory, Lower Brailes, Oxfordshire: A stunning wood-panelled property dating from the 14th century, this boasts eight bedrooms, a sun-drenched terrace and its own private lake, complete with duck house. There’s a three-bedroom coach house for guests and it’s set at the end of a no-through road. Certainly, the lush green countryside encompassing swathes of Warwickshire, Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire is a huge draw for London-dwellers eager to snap up rural boltholes. Just an hour or so from the capital, it's home (or at least a weekend retreat) to A-listers, politicians and media executives: the Camerons, Beckhams, Kate Moss, Lily Allen and Stella McCartney all have million-pound properties in the area. 'It's like a magnet,' says Sophie Gannon, of Savills Estate Agents in Banbury, Oxfordshire. 'If you get one person, you get them all.' However, Harry isn't following the crowd but listening to his heart. The Cotswolds, and specifically Highgrove, which was bought by his father's private estate in 1980, is where the Prince spent much of his childhood. It was Charles and Diana's weekend home, with 15-acre grounds and, later on, a teenage haven in the cellars of the main house, which Harry nicknamed 'Club H'. £2.95million - Fanthill, Banbury, Oxfordshire: Accessed through electric gates, up a winding driveway, this eight-bedroom house sits among 20 acres of land, so ticks all Harry’s boxes when it comes to privacy. There’s a heated outdoor pool, miniature golf course and a carp lake, where the young lovebirds could row off the private pier A local who knows the family says: 'It's not surprising that Harry would like to live where he feels at home. 'He's lived in the Cotswolds all his life and often returns to visit his father. After his mother died, it became a place of sanctuary. 'When the boys entered their teens, Charles bought several homes in the area, thinking they might want one in the future.'

Cousin Zara, her rugby-player husband Mike Tindall and their daughter Mia, three, live six miles from Highgrove in a cottage at Gatcombe Park, Princess Anne's country estate. The Beckham brood, of whom the Prince is very fond, have been renovating a £5 million plot on the 4,000-acre Great Tew Estate in Chipping Norton since 2015. Palace insiders say it's this tight-knit circle of friends that has prompted the couple to focus their search on the Cotswolds rather than Norfolk, where William and Kate rule the roost at Anmer Hall, a grand Georgian pile boasting a swimming pool and tennis court. 'They don't want to be second-runners to Kate and William,' one source says. Locals have spotted the Prince — without his girlfriend — discreetly checking out several Cotswolds hotspots in recent months. The blacked-out Range Rovers driven by royal protection officers have been spotted navigating the country lanes around Cirencester and Stow-on-the-Wold, while Harry has apparently been sipping pints of bitter in low-key village pubs. £7.75million - Luckington Court, Chippenham, Wiltshire: This 11th-century house with original Tudor features is set in 157 acres of woodland and pasture, surrounded by a secure fence. There are eight bedrooms, four reception rooms, two kitchens, a music room, study and plenty of space for staff — a must for any royal retreat 'I'm not surprised he's moving here — he's in the local quite often,' says one resident. 'You'd see his security men sitting outside and you'd know he'd be in there.' Of course, there are practical reasons for moving to the Cotswolds. Harry's royal duties require him to be close to London and Toronto-based Meghan, whose time on the U.S. TV series Suits is coming to an end, wouldn't cope well with","Wills and Kate's outdated home in Norfolk is being forgotten as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle express their desire to live in the Cotswolds. The local estate agents are excited about the prospect. After being together for 15 months, it is inevitable that the couple will eventually move in together. Prince Harry, with Meghan's input, is now house-hunting in Oxfordshire and has a particular interest in high-end properties in the Cotswold hills. He has always had an affinity for the area due to his childhood spent there. They are specifically looking for properties that offer privacy and are drawn to the rustic charm of the Cotswolds. The Cotswolds is also popular among other celebrities and influential figures, making it a desirable location. Harry is not simply relying on his father's property and wants to invest in his own place. The couple's close friends and relatives already live in the Cotswolds, which has influenced their decision. They prefer this area over Norfolk, where William and Kate currently reside. Over the past few months, Harry has been seen exploring various locations in the Cotswolds without Meghan. Moving to the Cotswolds makes sense for practical reasons as well, given Harry's royal responsibilities and Meghan's career."
gossipcop-914729,"Teen Mom’s Briana DeJesus Shows Off Body Transformation After Plastic Surgery  After pregnancy, many moms are expected to bounce back to their pre-baby bodies.  While some women are able to lose pregnancy weight and regain their figures through diet and exercise, most women experience physical changes that may require additional help.  Fortunately, plastic surgeons are able to perform a mommy makeover to address sagging breasts, loose abdominal muscles and skin, and excess fat in the abdomen, flanks, hips, and thighs.  For most patients, a mommy makeover is something that they want to do to look and feel better about themselves.  Women may have friends that have had this procedure or know of celebrities or social media stars that have had a surgical body transformation. Such is the case with Teen Mom’s star Briana DeJesus, who recently underwent a Mommy Makeover procedure.  What Is a Mommy Makeover?  A mommy makeover includes several plastic surgeries, which may be performed at once, to help women reshape and contour their bodies after they have given birth.  Many patients will be treated with a breast lift, breast augmentation, tummy tuck, liposuction, and other body contouring treatments.  Who’s a Good Candidate?  Most plastic surgeons recommend that women have a mommy makeover once they are finished having children.  Many female patients may begin considering this series of surgeries anytime during their child-bearing years, but may delay treatment until after their last pregnancy.  Additionally, women that are breast-feeding will often wait until they have transitioned their child to a bottle or solid foods, before undergoing any type of surgery.  What Surgeries Are Involved?  A breast lift can tighten breast issue, remove excess skin, and resize or reposition the breast and areola for a perkier appearance. Women, especially those that breast feed, may also have a breast augmentation to address volume loss.  An abdominoplasty or tummy tuck tightens muscles, eliminates saggy skin, and creates a new belly button to restore feminine curves and a streamlined silhouette.  Additionally, liposuction may be perfumed on one or more areas of the body to target excess fat, and a Brazilian butt lift can boost a women’s less than pert backside.  For DeJesus, her doctor combined a tummy tuck with a breast lift.  “I did a tummy tuck, a breast lift with an implant exchange because she did have implants from before—she wanted to be smaller, higher and perkier—so we changed her implants out for smaller ones,” said Dr. Miami, via E! News. “And we also did some contouring and reshaping of her booty, of her shape overall. We did that, I think it was a week ago Monday.”  Recovery  Depending on the number of procedures, women may have one to four weeks of downtime following a mommy makeover. They can expect to be evaluated by their surgeon several times during this period.  Patients will receive detailed post-operative instructions from their treating physician including exercise and other physical restrictions. They will continue to be under the care of their plastic surgeon for routine follow-ups over the next 12-18 months.  Additionally, it’s important for patients to have physical and emotional support from their significant other, family, and friends during the recovery process.

I love you!”  Jenn Glasser/https://www.facebook.com/G7Studio/  For the cap and gown photos, which were captured by her friend, Jenn Glasser, the MTV star wore a simple black dress with matching black sandals, black and white beaded bracelets, and a cream, black and gold statement necklace.

Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “Guess what today is!” she wrote, adding a series of emojis (including the graduation cap) and the hashtag “#DSU.”  “We did it!” she added on Twitter — writing later, “there’s beauty in the struggle.”  On Sunday, Lowry took to her blog to share pictures from her recent graduation photo shoot with her two sons — and her baby bump!  “Between teen motherhood, financial hurdles in the beginning, then moving to a new state, marriage, babies and divorce… and then of course just wanting to give up, I (barely) held on,” she wrote of her struggle to get her degree.  “This has been an extremely long and emotional road for me and for my family,” she added. “There are a select few people around me that have helped make this possible for me, they know who they are and I’m so thankful for them. I love you!”  Jenn Glasser/https://www.facebook.com/G7Studio/  For the cap and gown photos, which were captured by her friend, Jenn Glasser, the MTV star wore a simple black dress with matching black sandals, black and white beaded bracelets, and a cream, black and gold statement necklace.  In college graduation tradition, Lowry personalized her cap with fake, stick-on diamonds and gold sticker letters that read, “mom X3 + a degree.”  She presumably wore that cap on Saturday — though her Instagram post didn’t show it.

The MTV star revealed in a blog post in February that she is pregnant with her third child — confirming on May 2 that the baby’s father is her friend Chris Lopez.  Fans began to suspect that Lopez was the father after Lowry uploaded a photo of herself cradling her baby bump on April 26 with the caption: “Happy bump day from Baby Lo & me.”  I bought baby bows today… JUSTTTTT in case we have a girl 😂🤰🏼🎀 — Kail Lowry (@KailLowry) May 12, 2017  While the baby’s father has been confirmed, the sex of the baby appears to be even unknown for Lowry. She tweeted on Thursday, “I bought baby bows today… JUSTTTTT in case we have a girl.”  In February, Lowry admitted that she was trepidatious about the pregnancy initially.  “This is the baby I thought I wasn’t sure if I could have. I know this isn’t an ideal situation but I know everything will be okay,” she wrote. “And like I say in my book — with a little bit of hustle and heart, I can and I will survive anything. Having another child is something I am so happy about and I just can’t wait. My boys are so excited, those who love me are so excited, and I hope that everyone can just be happy for me during this time.”"

And while a lot of it may be down to great genes, Lopez has revealed in a new interview some of her beauty secrets and yep, they’re as diva as you might expect.  Lopez credits her glow to positive affirmations, revealing she says one in particular to herself every day to keep her radiant, youthful look intact.  So what is this magic phrase?  “I am youthful and timeless at every age,” Lopez says every single day—but it’s not enough to just say the mantra daily, because Lopez also has a handful of pillows with these words and more mantras embroidered into them all over her home. “I tell myself that every day, a few times a day. It sounds like clichéd bullshit, but it’s not: Age is all in your mind. Look at Jane Fonda.”  Lopez continues, “The affirmations are everywhere. I forget that they’re all here.

The book asserts there is a correlation between depression and anxiety and shorter telomeres and that “when pessimists develop an aging-related illness, like cancer or heart disease, the illness tends to progress faster.”  And really there's only so far a little highlight can go, step one is all about a positive attitude.

She believes that her positive affirmations play a significant role in maintaining her radiant appearance. Every day, she repeats the mantra, ""I am youthful and timeless at every age,"" and even has pillows embroidered with similar affirmations throughout her home. While some may dismiss her positivity, scientific research suggests that negative thoughts can contribute to the aging process. Dr. Blackburn, a Nobel Prize winner, and Dr. Epel, an anti-aging psychologist, have explored the connection between telomeres, stress, sleep, diet, and overall health in their book, ""The Telomere Effect: A Revolutionary Approach to Living Younger, Healthier, Longer."" They argue that pessimism can accelerate the progression of aging-related illnesses. Therefore, maintaining a positive attitude is crucial for maintaining a youthful glow. Additionally, choosing a high-quality pillowcase and adopting a new mantra can also enhance one's well-being.

Ever since 2017’s awards season rolled around, the 22-year-old actor -- who stole our hearts by being dangerously charming in Call Me By Your Name and the ultimate face of fuccboi existentialism in Lady Bird -- has been that Hot Young Thing. It seems like everybody, whether they’re 15 or 50, gay or straight, man, woman or non-binary, is professing to be the New York native’s greatest admirer. The natural byproduct of a young actor being thrust suddenly into the spotlight nowadays, is that the fashion world fawns over them. When it comes time to suit up for awards ceremonies or to head out on the road for a massive promo tour, the fashion cognoscenti try and predict who will be gunning for gold, and reach out to forge relationships with the next generation of acting talent. He’s yet to be a campaign boy (Lucas Hedges and Charlie Plummer, for example, were the final faces of Kris van Assche’s Dior Homme), but Timothée’s already delivered some stellar red carpet looks thanks to a loyal link-up with menswear master Haider Ackermann. It’s a far cry from those high school days rocking snapbacks for his now infamous rap persona. But with each passing year, from cocky high school drama kid, to dressing modestly at schmoozy film events, to flat-out dominating the red carpets last awards season, Timothée has always proved that he’s a man of growth. These, in our humble opinion, are a selection of his most important looks; the ones that have acted as bookmarks in his style story from the very beginning. 2013: Lil Timmy Tim Okay, we don’t know about you, but we feel it’s unfair for anybody to judge the fashion choices of a kid, purely because we’ve all dressed like an absolute dickhead at some point in your lives. But Timothée Chalamet ain’t no normal kid -- he’s got a bloody Academy Award nomination! -- so we’ll start our journey at his first (and so far only) foray into the music world, with his now prolific Lil Timmy Tim act. At 17 years old, his fashion sense was clearly still in its formative stages. As he jumped on stage at LaGuardia High School’s Rising Stars of 2012 event, Dougy-ing like no white boy had ever Dougied before, Lil Timmy Tim decided to don a pair of MC Hammer-worthy white adidas sweats and a pastel-pink T-shirt. We’d call this the ultimate ‘ask for your number and never actually call you’ outfit, and as he strips the tee off to reveal a DIY vest bearing Nicki Minaj’s face on the back and his digits scrawled in Sharpie on the front, our worst fears are confirmed. In hindsight, this is a troubling but necessary step in Timothée’s fashion journey. We low-key love him for it anyway. 2014: Timmy’s first TIFF At this point in Timothée’s impending rise to fame, a full three years before Call Me By Your Name premiered, the then 18-year-old had shed the Lil Timmy Tim persona in favor of something a little less ostentatious. At the Toronto Film Festival premiere of his 2014 movie Men, Women and Children he left the sweatpants at home and opted for a modest, if crowd-pleasing, grey and white striped roll-neck. But if you thought he was going all conservative on us, think again! He kept it young by pairing it with some frayed black denim and camo-print desert boots.

The billowy shirts; arse cheek-scraping short shorts; classic wayfarer sunglasses; jewelry bearing the Star of David -- all elements of Call Me By Your Name’s flawless wardrobe design that imbued Guadagnino’s queer love story with a stunning sense of sex, electricity, and romanticism. As soon as Elio’s outfits reached the public, inspiring thinkpieces a plenty, the world went gaga for his 1980s wardrobe. That vintage shirt from the final scene (you know, the one covered with faces on it) soon became the most sought-after piece for every London fashion queer’s wardrobe.

Of course, Timothée tried to pocket some of the film’s most coveted pieces, including an endless array of Lacoste polo shirts that belonged to the film’s producer, but wasn’t so lucky.

From “cool pants” to clover emojis, there’s a lot of backstory that needs explaining in order to completely understand everything that went down among Kanye West and Wiz Khalifa and Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna. To keep you informed, Us Weekly has broken it down with a comprehensive timeline of events. Kanye West Dates Amber Rose In 2008, the Grammy-winning rapper started a relationship with unknown model Rose after spotting her in Ludacris’ “What Them Girls Like” music video.

gossipcop-9639077061,"Ivanka Trump is becoming one of the most powerful first children in American History – despite not having an official job in the Trump administration. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) Ivanka Trump’s products weren’t always the hottest items online. In January, for instance, the first daughter’s fashion line ranked No. 550 based on the number of orders from Lyst, the biggest fashion e-commerce website in the world, according to Forbes. That changed dramatically the following month. Sales of Trump’s products skyrocketed in early February, making her Lyst’s 11th most popular brand. The biggest spike, according to Lyst, came on Feb. 9, when sales jumped by 219 percent from the day before. Yes, Feb. 9 — the same day that White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted Trump’s clothing and jewelry line on “Fox & Friends.” “Go buy Ivanka’s stuff is what I would tell you,” Conway said. “I’m going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody.” And viewers did, apparently. Sales of Ivanka Trump’s branded products skyrocketed on Feb. 9, the same day White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted the line on Fox News. (Lyst) Abigail Klem, president of the Ivanka Trump brand, said in a statement that “the beginning of February” shows “the best performing weeks in the history of the brand.” “For several different retailers, Ivanka Trump was a top performer online, and in some of the categories it was the best performance ever,” Klem said. Sarah Tanner, Lyst’s spokeswoman, said increases in sales are usually tied to current events. For instance, interest in pantsuits went up by 460 percent last year because of Hillary Clinton’s affinity for the style, she said. Sales of the first daughter’s products went up by 86 percent in November when her father won the presidential election, according to the company.

(Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) Ivanka Trump’s products weren’t always the hottest items online. In January, for instance, the first daughter’s fashion line ranked No. 550 based on the number of orders from Lyst, the biggest fashion e-commerce website in the world, according to Forbes. That changed dramatically the following month. Sales of Trump’s products skyrocketed in early February, making her Lyst’s 11th most popular brand. The biggest spike, according to Lyst, came on Feb. 9, when sales jumped by 219 percent from the day before. Yes, Feb. 9 — the same day that White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted Trump’s clothing and jewelry line on “Fox & Friends.” “Go buy Ivanka’s stuff is what I would tell you,” Conway said. “I’m going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody.” And viewers did, apparently. Sales of Ivanka Trump’s branded products skyrocketed on Feb. 9, the same day White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted the line on Fox News. (Lyst) Abigail Klem, president of the Ivanka Trump brand, said in a statement that “the beginning of February” shows “the best performing weeks in the history of the brand.” “For several different retailers, Ivanka Trump was a top performer online, and in some of the categories it was the best performance ever,” Klem said. Sarah Tanner, Lyst’s spokeswoman, said increases in sales are usually tied to current events. For instance, interest in pantsuits went up by 460 percent last year because of Hillary Clinton’s affinity for the style, she said. Sales of the first daughter’s products went up by 86 percent in November when her father won the presidential election, according to the company.

Bar — partly because of her on-air endorsement of Trump’s products. According to Lyst, February drew unusually large numbers of orders across many Ivanka Trump-branded products, including dresses, shoes, pants, coats, knitwear and tops. Heels were the bestsellers, followed by dresses. “We’ve never seen such a large uptick,” Tanner said. “Typically, she’s not in our top 100 sellers.” Comparing February’s numbers with last year’s average number of orders of Ivanka Trump products shows a difference of 557 percent. (Tanner said company policy prohibits her from sharing the actual numbers of online sales.) The excitement of the brand, however, may be slumping. The company’s numbers show sales were gradually tapering off toward the end of February. March does not appear to be as remarkable, but sales are still on track to be about 8 percent better than they were in January, according to Lyst.

Some retailers have partially or completely distanced themselves from the Trump brand. Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus and Belk have stopped selling Trump’s branded line of clothing, shoes and jewelry. T.J. Maxx and Marshalls have instructed employees to stop promoting Trump products in stores and to move Trump clothing into general merchandise racks. Sears Holdings and subsidiary Kmart discontinued online sales of 31 items from the Trump Home collection last month, though their websites still contain items sold by third-party sellers.","Ivanka Trump, despite not having an official position in her father's administration, has become one of the most influential first children in American history. Her fashion line, although initially lacking popularity, experienced a dramatic increase in sales in February. This surge in sales can be attributed to White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoting Trump's products on a televised interview. However, Conway's endorsement has been criticized for violating ethics rules. Concerns about her comments led to a complaint filed by law professors against Conway. Although sales for Ivanka Trump's brand have tapered off since February, they are still expected to be higher than January's sales. The brand has also managed to withstand the effects of a boycott campaign against Trump-branded products. Several retailers have distanced themselves from the brand, but others continue to stock the products."

But Daniel Craig may now be regretting his words, as he has confirmed he will, for one final time, play James Bond.  Speaking on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on US TV on Tuesday night, the actor finally put an end to the long-running saga of will he/won’t he play the character for a fifth time.  “I have been quite cagey about it. I have been doing interviews all day and people have been asking me and I think I’ve been rather coy. But kind of felt like if I was going to speak the truth I should speak truth to you.”  Asked by Colbert directly whether he could deliver some “good news” about returning as Bond, Craig finally replied: “Yes.”  He revealed he had known for a “couple of months”, adding: “We’ve been discussing it, we’ve just been trying to figure things out. I always wanted to, I needed a break.”  However, he was keen to reiterate it would indeed be his last outing as the lothario spy. “I think this is it. I just want to go out on a high note and I can’t wait,” he said.  It is not surprising news, as his return was first reported in July. However, Craig’s renewed enthusiasm for the role marks a change of mind after comments he made in 2015, following the release of Spectre.  Edan Clay (@EdanClay) Thank f*cking GAWD!

Hurry the f*ck up!!! pic.twitter.com/tx8MqPhpnR  The film garnered rave reviews but Craig, clearly frustrated with the promotional commitments that accompanied playing Bond, said he would rather “slit my wrists” than reprise the role.  “I’m over it at the moment. We’re done. All I want to do is move on,” he said, adding: “If I did another Bond movie, it would only be for the money.”  But explaining his heated comments, Craig told Colbert that they had been made in the moment, two days after Spectre had finished shooting when he was exhausted. “Instead of saying something with style and grace, I said something really stupid,” he said.  It is the source of much speculation of how much the film studios will have promised Craig to tempt him back. He was rumoured to have been paid $65m (£48.66m) for Spectre, and in 2016 it was reported he had been offered $150m to shoot two more Bond films, almost back to back.

gossipcop-780888,"Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge wasn’t always a royal, but even before her marriage to Prince William, Kate Middleton had an impressive net worth.  Middleton had a comfortable upbringing before she became the first commoner to join the royal family after she married William in 2011. But Middleton’s net worth ballooned once she became a duchess.  Here’s everything we know about Middleton’s net worth:  What is Kate Middleton’s net worth?  The 36 year-old mother of three — who gave birth to a second baby boy in April — is worth at least £5 million, or $7 million, according to global wealth-tracking firm Wealth-X, though some estimates put her net worth as high as £7.3 million, or $10 million. Middleton’s wealth is mostly in cash because she doesn’t have a personal portfolio of property or artwork.  That being said, Middleton’s net worth is a lot less than her prince — Wealth-X estimates Prince William’s net worth is at least $30 million, though some reports put his fortune closer to $40 million. According to Wealth-X, $19 million of Prince William’s wealth is in cash.

Chris Jackson—Getty Images  What do we know about Kate Middleton’s money?  Most of Middleton’s net worth stems from Party Pieces, an online party supplies business started by her parents. The company is estimated to be worth around £30 million, or $50 million, thanks in no small part to the exposure it gets from being associated with the royals, according to royal expert Marlene Koenig.  Prior to her life as a full-time duchess, Middleton worked for the family business and was a part-time accessories buyer for a retailer called Jigsaw.  Growing up, Kate and her two siblings, Pippa and James Middleton, attended expensive privates schools from a young age, with years of tuition for just one child estimated to be at least £250,000, or $350,000. Kate met Prince William while in college in Scotland at the prestigious University of St. Andrew’s. She graduated in 2005 with a degree in Art History.  How did Kate Middleton’s net worth change after marrying Prince William?  Joining the royal family meant that Middleton was marrying into an incredible $88 billion fortune amassed over generations.  Before Will and Kate became the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and moved into a 20-room apartment in Kensington Palace, Kate lived in an apartment purchased by her parents in the Chelsea neighborhood of London believed to be worth £1 million, or $1.4 million.

Chris Jackson—Getty Images  But once Kate officially became a royal she didn’t need to spend much of her own money anymore. Most of her living costs are covered by the private estate Prince Charles manages, the Duchy of Cornwall. The revenue from the Duchy of Cornwall pays for the most of Prince Charles and his family’s royal expenses: things like official travel, wardrobe, housing and staff costs. When Meghan Markle marries Prince Harry on May 19, she too, will get to keep most of her own money — her net worth is believed to be about $5 million — as the Duchy of Cornwall will also absorb the majority of her living costs associated with royal responsibilities.  What is the ‘Kate effect’?  As the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate sets fashion trends all over the world. While she herself does not retain any income from the flurry of economic activity set off by the designer clothes she wears for public appearances, she has triggered what is known as “the Kate Effect,” ",0,en,0,"Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge wasn’t always a royal, but even before her marriage to Prince William, Kate Middleton had an impressive net worth.  Middleton had a comfortable upbringing before she became the first commoner to join the royal family after she married William in 2011. But Middleton’s net worth ballooned once she became a duchess.  Here’s everything we know about Middleton’s net worth:  What is Kate Middleton’s net worth?  The 36 year-old mother of three — who gave birth to a second baby boy in April — is worth at least £5 million, or $7 million, according to global wealth-tracking firm Wealth-X, though some estimates put her net worth as high as £7.3 million, or $10 million. Middleton’s wealth is mostly in cash because she doesn’t have a personal portfolio of property or artwork.  That being said, Middleton’s net worth is a lot less than her prince — Wealth-X estimates Prince William’s net worth is at least $30 million, though some reports put his fortune closer to $40 million. According to Wealth-X, $19 million of Prince William’s wealth is in cash. The wealth tracking firm also noted that William has an expensive helicopter fit for a royal — an Augusta A109S Grand helicopter which is valued at $11 million.

Josh neglected to invite Drake to his wedding and Drake called him out on Twitter, forcing fans to face the possibility that their fave TV brothers weren't nearly as friendly IRL. But, as it turns out, the reason why Drake lashed out against Josh online was not because they weren't friendly, it's because they're like actual brothers.

While it is understandable that security is a concern in South Africa, this particular provision may be perceived as excessive."

She claimed Kelly recorded the act on his iPad without her consent.  Rodgers said after the incident, Kelly asked how old she was.  “I told him and he’s like, ‘You know, if you’re really, you know, 16, that you can tell daddy, right?’ And he was like, ‘You know, you just look about 14, 15 or 16,’” she said.  Rodgers said in the suit that she was in a relationship with Kelly for a year, in which he “routinely engaged in intimidation, mental, verbal and sexual abuse, during and after sexual contact.” The suit alleges Kelly’s actions were “designed to humiliate, embarrass, intimate and shame her.”  The suit is seeking unspecified damages, alleging sexual battery, false imprisonment and failure to disclose a sexually transmitted disease. CBS News reported that Rodgers previously filed a criminal complaint with the Dallas Police Department in April.  In the past, Kelly has routinely denied allegations of sexual abuse. In response to the April criminal complaint, Kelly’s representative said the musician “categorically denies all claims and allegations.”"

DiCaprio will play an aging, out-of-work actor in the film. Margot Robbie, meanwhile, is being eyed for the role of Sharon Tate.

gossipcop-911679,"EXCLUSIVE: In a very competitive situation, Netflix has landed The Politician, a new hourlong comedy series from longtime collaborators Brad Falchuk, Ian Brennan and Ryan Murphy, I have learned. The project, starring Tony winner Ben Platt (Dear Evan Hansen), with Oscar winners Barbra Streisand and Gwyneth Paltrow in negotiations to co-star, has received a two-season straight-to-series order, I hear.  The deal, believed to be the biggest TV package sale of the year, came after a weeklong bidding war among top streaming players, including Amazon and Hulu, sources said. It gives prolific creator-producer Murphy two series on Netflix, along with the upcoming Ratched.  RESX/Shutterstock  As he does on all of his shows, Murphy will direct the pilot for The Politician, described as a one-hour comedy with social commentary. If Streisand and Paltrow’s deals close, Streisand will be part of the production team as well as directing, with Paltrow also expected to produce. It would be the first major TV series role for both feature actress.  Details about the plot and characters in The Politician are being kept under wraps, but according to a source close to the project, it revolves around the politician aspirations of Platt’s Payton, a wealthy Santa Barbarian, and every season will revolve around a different political race his character is involved in.  Rex/Shutterstock  I hear that Platt will have musical numbers in several episodes of the show. That, along with the potential involvement of Paltrow and Streisand, helped drive interest in the project, sparking a heated bidding and leading to the big Netflix deal.  Frequent collaborators Falchuk and Murphy had been quietly working on the script for The Politician for the past year. The two brought in their Glee co-creator Brennan, with the three expected to share co-creator credit. Platt also was attached early on and is heavily involved in the casting of the series, which eyes a potential late summer production start.  The project hails from Fox 21 TV Studios under Murphy’s overall deal at 20th Century Fox TV. Its packaging was guided by Fox TV Group chairman Dana Walden, a longtime Murphy collaborator who oversees the studio.  Paltrow previously worked on Falchuk, Murphy and Brennan’s Glee. The actress, who is engaged to Falchuk, won an Emmy for her guest-starring role on Fox’s high school musical dramedy.  The deal for The Politician comes on the heels of the successful launch of Falchuk and Murphy’s latest collaboration, drama series 9-1-1 (co-created with Tim Minear), which has been a breakout hit for Fox and was renewed for a second season only two episodes into its freshman run. The Politician marks Murphy and Falchuk’s fourth television series as co-creators, joining 9-1-1 as well as FX’s American Horror Story and the upcoming Pose (co-created by Steven Canals). Murphy is also the mastermind behind FX’s American Crime Story and Feud as well as Netflix’s upcoming Ratched starring Emmy winner Sarah Paulson (AHS franchise, People v. O.J. Simpson) as a younger version of the diabolical Nurse Ratched from One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest.  Netflix  Netflix has emerged as the streaming home of Murphy by snagging both of his series to hit the premium space in the past five months. The latest development is sure to further fuel speculation about the future of Murphy, one of the top creator-producers working in television today who has pulled off the rare feat of launching commercial and award-winning hits on both broadcast and cable. Netflix has been widely rumored to be among a slew of suitors for Murphy, whose current deal with 20th Century Fox TV expires later this year.  “I haven’t made a decision of where I’m going to go, I’m going to sit back and wait,” Murphy said at TCA last month when asked whether he would stay at the studio, which is in the process of being acquired by Disney.

Photographs of the pair strolling out of a restaurant late Sunday night sparked speculation, but a rep for the “Avengers” actress tells us that there’s no romance happening.  “Simply put, they are friends as well as neighbors [in the Hamptons],” says ScarJo’s rep.  Flay, who in 2015 had a publicly contentious split from his wife of 10 years, Stephanie March, was last linked to “Masters of Sex” actress Heléne Yorke.

Jennifer Holliday is backing out of performing at Trump's inauguration celebration after receiving backlash from her fans. Kareem Quow for KQ Photography  Holliday, best known for her Tony-winning role in Broadway's ""Dreamgirls,"" faced pressure from her gay, lesbian and black fans when it was announced she would sing at a Thursday concert at Washington's Lincoln Memorial.  Holliday said in a statement Saturday that she apologized for her lapse of judgment, for being uneducated on the issues and causing heartbreak for her fans.  Several prominent entertainers have declined to perform at Trump inaugural festivities. Country star Toby Keith and actor Jon Voigt are in the lineup for Thursday's concert.  Holliday's reversal was first reported by The Wrap; the publication obtained a letter Holliday wrote to her fans. Her representative, Bill Carpenter, confirmed the details in the letter to The Associated Press.  ""My only choice must now be to stand with the LGBT Community and to state unequivocally that I WILL NOT PERFORM FOR THE WELCOME CONCERT OR FOR ANY OF THE INAUGURATION FESTIVITIES!"" she wrote.  ""Please know that I HEAR YOU and I feel your pain. The LGBT Community was mostly responsible for birthing my career and I am deeply indebted to you,"" she added.

The performer, who most recently starred on Broadway in ""The Color Purple,"" said she was hurt by the angry backlash, which included calls to boycott her music. Others called her ""Uncle Tom"" and there was even a suggestion that she take her own life.  ""It just really made my heart drop to my feet,"" Holliday said.

Nicole Kidman was among the best dressed of the night in a red halter Calvin Klein Calvin Klein by Appointment gown with a pleated bust. “Handmaid’s” Yvonne Strahovski also worked the red hot shade in a custom Julien MacDonald silk number, as did Sarah Hyland in a fiery cutout Zac Posen, Heidi Klum in plunging Peter Dundas, and Issa Rae in an asymmetrical Vera Wang. (""The Handmaid's Tale"" author Margaret Atwood was also notably in red.) “A red dress is fiery, it’s sexy, it’s a universal power color,” celebrity stylist Robert Verdi told Moneyish. “And it also says ‘resistance’ in my opinion, so it makes a strong statement.” Viola Davis wore Zac Posen.

While public debate rages about Donald Trump’s health, Melania has told friends and associates that the once robust and high energy man she knew and loved has been replaced with a “slower, damaged version”.  “By 8pm he is slurring,” she said. “This is not the man I know.”  Fearing that the sedatives are being pumped into the body of the POTUS via Coca-Cola that he orders by pressing a button he had installed on the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, Melania has insisted he stop drinking from the tap and instead revert to drinking from cans she brings herself.  “Donald’s heath improved out of sight when he stopped drinking from the tap,” Melania said.  However the First Lady fears the active campaign to poison the president is “a high level operation” and “not the work of a solitary loon.”  Melania is popular in the White House—as she is with the rest of the country—and she has befriended senior intelligence agency staff who remain loyal to president. They have educated her about Ronald Regan’s poisoning by the Deep State after his assassination attempt in 1981. They have also warned her that George W. Bush was reduced to a “brain damaged” state after years of steady poisoning.  But the advantage Trump may hold over his GOP predecessors in the Oval Office is that he has a wife who is wise to the ruse and is insisting he watch his food and drink intake closely for signs of adulteration.

She believes that someone is smuggling heavy sedatives into his drinks, causing him to appear slower and less energetic. Melania suspects that the sedatives may be hidden in the Coca-Cola ordered by the President, prompting her to bring cans of the drink herself for him to consume. She views this operation as being highly organized and not the work of an individual acting alone. Melania has been informed by senior intelligence agency staff about previous instances of poisoning of presidents, such as Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush.

Raised in SoHo and on the Lower East Side by a father descended from Spanish nobility and a mother who is a policy analyst on women’s issues in Third World countries, de la Huerta had been acting and modeling since her teens, and now seemed to be breaking through. The year before she had co-starred in Gaspar Noé’s Enter the Void, which had recently opened in the U.S. And her recurring role on HBO’s just-premiered Prohibition-period gangster drama, Boardwalk Empire, as mistress to Steve Buscemi’s Enoch “Nucky” Thompson, had earned her critical praise.  One night that November, de la Huerta ran into Harvey Weinstein at the Top of the Standard bar at the Standard, High Line hotel in Manhattan. She had first met Weinstein while making the movie Cider House Rules when she was 14. De la Huerta had communicated with the producer over the years after their first meeting. At around age 21, she said, Weinstein sent her some science-fiction books and suggested she might be right for a role in one of his projects. When they met at the hotel in 2010 de la Huerta was 26 and Weinstein was at the height of his powers as an Oscar-winning producer. The Weinstein Company was about to enter a streak that would see it win best picture at the Academy Awards two years in a row, first for The King’s Speech in 2011 and then The Artist in 2012. Weinstein offered de la Huerta a ride home to Tribeca. In de la Huerta’s account of the night, Weinstein arrived at her apartment demanding to come inside and have a drink. “Things got very uncomfortable very fast,” the actress, now 33, told Vanity Fair in a phone interview on Wednesday.  “Immediately when we got inside the house, he started to kiss me and I kind of brushed [him] away,” de la Huerta said. “Then he pushed me onto the bed and his pants were down and he lifted up my skirt. I felt afraid. . . . It wasn’t consensual . . . It happened very quickly. . . . He stuck himself inside me. . . . When he was done he said he’d be calling me. I kind of just laid on the bed in shock.”  De la Huerta described a second assault that allegedly happened in late December 2010, when Weinstein showed up in her building lobby after she came home from a photo shoot. The actress said she had been drinking, and was frightened by Weinstein, who had been repeatedly calling her, despite her asking him to leave her alone. “He hushed me and said, ‘Let’s talk about this in your apartment,’” de la Huerta said. “I was in no state. I was so terrified of him. . . . I did say no, and when he was on top of me I said, ‘I don’t want to do this.’ He kept humping me and it was disgusting. He’s like a pig. . . .

Born Kate Garry Hudson on April 19, 1979, in Los Angeles, California, US, she came to prominence in 2001 with her incredible turn in Almost Famous. This role not only made her famous, but it also fetched her a Golden Globe and several nominations, including a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Being a daughter of American actress Goldie Hawn, Hudson bears more than a passing resemblance to her famous mother in both looks and onscreen vivacity. She got the chance to showcase her talent in 1996, when she made her TV debut on Fox's TV series Party of Five (1994-2000). Although she only appeared in one episode titled ""Spring Breaks: Part 1"", this initial experience was enough to uphold her determination to develop a professional acting career in Hollywood. However, it was in 1999 that she started to attract public attention when critics lauded her brilliant portrayal of Cindy in ""200 Cigarettes"", even though the movie itself was a commercial disappointment. Onwards, her career experienced a significant advancement, especially after she managed to obtain a supporting role in ""Gossip"" and ""Dr T and the Women"" which both came up in 2000. While her accolade-worthy performance in Cameron Crowe's Almost Famous indicated that she was set to follow her mother in taking the film industry by storm. In the midst of a whirlwind schedule of fashion shoots and awards shows, she made an appearance in the romantic war drama The Four Feathers in 2002. Turning out to be a box-office failure, Hudson fired back with the surefire hit as she starred opposite quirky heartthrob Matthew McConaughey in the romantic comedy How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003).

gossipcop-913462,"May we never forget the bizarre story that set Bachelor Nation ablaze: The Bachelor's Bekah M. was reported missing, yes, full on listed as a missing person in Humboldt County, California, even while people were watching her on the show. Though she has commented on it via Twitter in the past, as it turns out, why Bekah M. was reported missing is a totally relatable story. While appearing on Jimmy Kimmel Live, Kimmel interviewed Bekah M., or Bekah Martinez, over a video call. After he asked if she got her pink fringed earrings from the marijuana farm — the North Coast Journal reported that the former Bachelor contestant had gone to Humboldt to work on a marijuana farm — Martinez got a chance to explain the whole story.  TheNorth Coast Journal listed her as a missing person in Humboldt County, California on Feb. 1. (The Northern California newspaper reported Bekah M. as being one of the ""Humboldt 35,"" which included a list of 34 other missing persons. The list is now down to 33, according to the Journal, thanks to Bekah M. being accounted for.) ""First of all,"" she told Kimmel. ""A lot of people thought I lied to my mother saying I was on a farm when I was actually on the Bachelor but no, I had already been eliminated from the show.""  ABC/YouTube  According to the missing persons report, Martinez left for Northern California on Nov. 12, and her mother reported that she'd been missing on Nov. 18 after not heard from her daughter. Since The Bachelor began filming on Sept. 20, and now everyone knows that Martinez was eliminated after the seventh week, that means that she left the show sometime in early Nov. 2017. The fact that she then went away to have a fun week with her friends makes sense, but it also led to some of the confusion as to why she'd gone MIA since many people suspected that Bekah M. was chosen by Arie Luyendyk, Jr. on The Bachelor.  After all, since Bachelor contestants have strict rules about phone usage, it made sense that Bekah M. would not call her mom for a few days in a row. And, since Nov. 18 would likely be when The Bachelor was wrapping up, it made fans think that she had made it to the final two — or that she was the one Luyendyk picked.  But, as it turns out, Bekah M. had been eliminated and she simply went away. ""I just decided to go up to the mountains with friends for a couple weeks and I was there for six or seven days without phone service,"" she told Kimmel. ""I thought that I was going to have phone service, and I told my mother that I would. I just had this weird feeling on the six or seventh day and I was like 'I need to go home now' so I got in my car, drove to where I had service, called my parents, and then come to find out only 12 hours before, my mother had called the Humboldt Sheriff's Department saying that I was missing.""  As for why the North Coast Journal reported that Martinez was on a marijuana farm when she'd just told Kimmel she wanted to go to the mountains, well, you'd have to know a bit about the local geography. ""I was on a marijuana farm?"" she said before laughing and then explaining, "" It's Humboldt County."" In case you're not from California, you should probably know that Humboldt County is densely populated with marijuana farms. Her simple explanation makes sense, and she also clarified to Kimmel that she's still a nanny in Los Angeles and not a weed farmer.  Besides the much-needed clarification, one of the best revelations to come from Bekah M.'s appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live was the fact that the Bachelor contestant remained close with Kendall. It even sounds like she has stayed close with most of the contestants from Arie's Bachelor season, except Tia, who played a big part in Martinez's elimination. Hopefully, this means that the young Bachelor contestant will come back for Bachelor in Paradise. Because Bachelor Nation needs Bekah M. — as long as she remembers to call her mother and not send the whole country into panic again.",0,en,0,"May we never forget the bizarre story that set Bachelor Nation ablaze: The Bachelor's Bekah M. was reported missing, yes, full on listed as a missing person in Humboldt County, California, even while people were watching her on the show.

After he asked if she got her pink fringed earrings from the marijuana farm — the North Coast Journal reported that the former Bachelor contestant had gone to Humboldt to work on a marijuana farm — Martinez got a chance to explain the whole story.  TheNorth Coast Journal listed her as a missing person in Humboldt County, California on Feb. 1. (The Northern California newspaper reported Bekah M. as being one of the ""Humboldt 35,"" which included a list of 34 other missing persons. The list is now down to 33, according to the Journal, thanks to Bekah M. being accounted for.) ""First of all,"" she told Kimmel. ""A lot of people thought I lied to my mother saying I was on a farm when I was actually on the Bachelor but no, I had already been eliminated from the show.""  ABC/YouTube  According to the missing persons report, Martinez left for Northern California on Nov. 12, and her mother reported that she'd been missing on Nov. 18 after not heard from her daughter. Since The Bachelor began filming on Sept. 20, and now everyone knows that Martinez was eliminated after the seventh week, that means that she left the show sometime in early Nov. 2017. The fact that she then went away to have a fun week with her friends makes sense, but it also led to some of the confusion as to why she'd gone MIA since many people suspected that Bekah M. was chosen by Arie Luyendyk, Jr. on The Bachelor.  After all, since Bachelor contestants have strict rules about phone usage, it made sense that Bekah M. would not call her mom for a few days in a row. And, since Nov. 18 would likely be when The Bachelor was wrapping up, it made fans think that she had made it to the final two — or that she was the one Luyendyk picked.  But, as it turns out, Bekah M. had been eliminated and she simply went away. ""I just decided to go up to the mountains with friends for a couple weeks and I was there for six or seven days without phone service,"" she told Kimmel. ""I thought that I was going to have phone service, and I told my mother that I would. I just had this weird feeling on the six or seventh day and I was like 'I need to go home now' so I got in my car, drove to where I had service, called my parents, and then come to find out only 12 hours before, my mother had called the Humboldt Sheriff's Department saying that I was missing.""  As for why the North Coast Journal reported that Martinez was on a marijuana farm when she'd just told Kimmel she wanted to go to the mountains, well, you'd have to know a bit about the local geography. ""I was on a marijuana farm?"" she said before laughing and then explaining, "" It's Humboldt County."" In case you're not from California, you should probably know that Humboldt County is densely populated with marijuana farms. Her simple explanation makes sense, and she also clarified to Kimmel that she's still a nanny in Los Angeles and not a weed farmer.  Besides the much-needed clarification, one of the best revelations to come from Bekah M.'s appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live was the fact that the Bachelor contestant remained close with Kendall. It even sounds like she has stayed close with most of the contestants from Arie's Bachelor season, except Tia, who played a big part in Martinez's elimination. Hopefully, this means that the young Bachelor contestant will come back for Bachelor in Paradise. Because Bachelor Nation needs Bekah M. — as long as she remembers to call her mother and not send the whole country into panic again."

gossipcop-6048462622,"Some reports suggest Ben Affleck and girlfriend Lindsay Shookus' relationship may have been going on even while they were still married to their respective spouses. A source tells ET that Affleck first saw Shookus while he was still married to Jennifer Garner, and Shookus was married to Kevin Miller -- a fellow Saturday Night Live producer. According to the source, Affleck and Shookus were seeing one another as far back as late 2014, months before news broke that he had an alleged fling with his children's nanny, Christine Ouzounian. Affleck's reported dalliance with the nanny happened in the summer of 2015, and was short-lived, our source says. However, a source close to 44-year-old Affleck disputes that the actor and Shookus got together while both were married, although the two were friendly. The source says the two got romantic after his separation from Garner in 2015.

Affleck last appeared on SNL in May 2013. Interestingly enough, Garner made an appearance during Affleck's monologue at the time, to celebrate the actor hosting the show for the fifth time. The two joked about Affleck's Best Picture acceptance speech for Argo at the Oscars, in which he said that his and Garner's marriage took ""work."" Affleck publicly thanked Garner for all her support onstage, and the two sweetly shared a kiss. One month later, eyewitnesses reportedly spotted Affleck and Shookus looking flirty at The Heat premiere after-party in NYC. ""He definitely looked interested in her,"" a partygoer told People at the time. The two later left together with other friends and headed to the nearby Mandarin Oriental hotel bar. Over the years, their relationship allegedly continued, though a source close to Affleck says the two did not get romantic until after his separation from Garner in 2015. Affleck and Shookus ""full-on had an affair,"" claims a source cited by People. ""They would fly back and forth, but he would mostly visit her in New York. They didn't hide.""

WATCH: 6 Things We Know About Ben Affleck's New Girlfriend Lindsay Shookus Let's take a look back at Affleck and Shookus' alleged relationship timeline. 2013: According to People, Affleck and Shookus started seeing one another in 2013, two years before Affleck and 45-year-old Garner announced their separation. Affleck last appeared on SNL in May 2013. Interestingly enough, Garner made an appearance during Affleck's monologue at the time, to celebrate the actor hosting the show for the fifth time. The two joked about Affleck's Best Picture acceptance speech for Argo at the Oscars, in which he said that his and Garner's marriage took ""work."" Affleck publicly thanked Garner for all her support onstage, and the two sweetly shared a kiss. One month later, eyewitnesses reportedly spotted Affleck and Shookus looking flirty at The Heat premiere after-party in NYC. ""He definitely looked interested in her,"" a partygoer told People at the time. The two later left together with other friends and headed to the nearby Mandarin Oriental hotel bar. Over the years, their relationship allegedly continued, though a source close to Affleck says the two did not get romantic until after his separation from Garner in 2015. Affleck and Shookus ""full-on had an affair,"" claims a source cited by People. ""They would fly back and forth, but he would mostly visit her in New York. They didn't hide."" ""Both of them were married at the time. They were having secret rendezvous every time he came in to New York City and other places, too,"" claims a second source the magazine quotes. ""Both of them were cheating on their spouses so they were very careful about it,"" the source alleges. X17online.com According to Us Weekly, the romance began just a few months after Shookus became a mom to her daughter with Miller. ""[Affleck and Shookus] were sleeping together, sending each other cute texts and meeting up whenever they could,"" an insider close to Garner and Affleck reportedly claims to the outlet. 2015: According to Us Weekly, Garner and Miller found out about the Affleck and Shookus' alleged relationship at the same time in 2015. ""They were devastated when they found out about the affair,"" a source claims according to the magazine. However, a source close to Affleck tells Us Weekly, ""Lindsay was not what led to the end of their marriage. They had a ton of other problems."" June 2015 -- Affleck and Garner separate Affleck and Garner announced their split on June 30, 2015. ""After much thought and careful consideration, we have made the difficult decision to divorce,"" the two said in their joint statement to ET. ""We go forward with love and friendship for one another and a commitment to co-parenting our children whose privacy we ask to be respected during this difficult time. This will be our only comment on this private, family matter. Thank you for understanding."" July 2015 -- The nanny scandal Us Weekly broke the story on July 29, claiming that Affleck had secretly been dating Ouzounian, and that the two frequently texted and emailed after she was let go as his children's nanny. Earlier that month, Ouzounian tipped off the paparazzi, telling them she'd be at the L.A.-area rental house that Affleck was staying in at the time, a source later told ET. The former nanny was seen smiling wide as she handed Affleck a bottle of champagne during their late-night meetup. She also arrived at Affleck's in his Lexus, which she had also been seen driving earlier in the day while running errands. Affleck's rep slammed the reports, telling ET that ""all allegations of a romantic relationship are baseless and untrue"" and that they are considering legal options. ""The story is complete garbage and full of lies,"" his rep stated. April 2017 -- Garner and Affleck officially file for divorce Affleck and Garner legally filed for divorce in April 2017, after a two-year separation. Still, the pair have made it clear that their three children -- Violet, Seraphina and Samuel -- remain their priority. Just one month earlier, Affleck thanked Garner for her support after announcing that he had just completed treatment for alcohol addiction. ""I'm lucky to have the love of my family and friends, including my co-parent, Jen, who has supported me and cared for our kids as I've done the work I set out to do,"" he wrote in his statement on Facebook. July 2017 -- Affleck steps out with Shookus Affleck was photographed with Shookus for the first time on July 6, when the two had dinner at Giorgio Baldi restaurant in Los Angeles. A source tells ET that Affleck's new relationship works ""really well,"" because Shookus ""has had experience with the Hollywood world."" ""[She] knows what is expected of Ben, and how much of their relationship they can share publicly,"" the source explains. ""It puts Ben at ease knowing that Lindsay understands who he is. They have kept their relationship very low key and private."" Another source also tells ET that much like Affleck and Garner, Shookus and her ex -- whom she married in 2010 -- are also ""extremely amicable."" ""They live separately but","There are reports suggesting that Ben Affleck and his girlfriend Lindsay Shookus may have been in a relationship even before they separated from their spouses. According to a source, Affleck first saw Shookus while he was married to Jennifer Garner and Shookus was married to Kevin Miller. The source claims that Affleck and Shookus were seeing each other as far back as late 2014, months before Affleck allegedly had a fling with his children's nanny in 2015. However, another source close to Affleck denies these claims and says that Affleck and Shookus got together romantically after his separation from Garner in 2015. Their alleged affair was reportedly full-on and they would frequently meet up in New York City. Garner and Miller found out about the affair in 2015, and the same year, Affleck and Garner announced their separation. Affleck was later involved in a scandal with his children's nanny, but his representatives denied any romantic relationship. Affleck and Garner officially filed for divorce in April 2017, and Affleck was spotted with Shookus in July 2017. Their relationship has been kept private and low-key."

gossipcop-7885025406,"More than a month has passed since Matt Lauer was fired from the Today show, and his former longtime colleague, Katie Couric, is now opening up about the former NBC anchor’s shocking dismissal.  “The whole thing has been very painful for me,” Couric, 61, tells PEOPLE. “The accounts I’ve read and heard have been disturbing, distressing and disorienting and it’s completely unacceptable that any woman at the Today show experienced this kind of treatment.  “I had no idea this was going on during my tenure or after I left,” she continued. “I think I speak for many of my former colleagues when I say this was not the Matt we knew. Matt was a kind and generous colleague who treated me with respect. In fact, a joke I once made on late-night television was just that, because it was completely contrary to our brother-sister relationship. It’s still very upsetting. I really admire the way Savannah [Guthrie] and Hoda [Kotb] and the entire Today show staff have handled a very difficult situation.”  The late-night show joke that Couric refers to is when she said on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen in 2012 that Lauer “pinches me on the ass a lot.” A clip of the comment made the rounds online in the wake of Lauer’s firing.  Couric spent 15 years co-hosting NBC’s Today show with Lauer, 60, but left in May 2006 to anchor the CBS Evening News.  NBC/Getty  Lauer was fired at the end of November by NBC News after the network received a “detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior,” with reason to believe “this may not have been an isolated incident.” Women have also anonymously accused him of sexual harassment and assault in reports published by Variety and The New York Times.  Following his firing, which was announced live on Today by Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb, Lauer addressed the original allegations in a statement.  “There are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions,” he said, in part. “To the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry. As I am writing this, I realize the depth of the damage and disappointment I have left behind at home and at NBC.”  Although her PEOPLE interview is the first time Couric has spoken in detail about Lauer’s exit, she briefly broke her silence about the scandal on social media in December.  In a short response to an Instagram user, who called Couric out for not publicly addressing the scandal, the veteran journalist said, “It’s incredibly upsetting and I will say something when I’m ready to. Thanks for your interest.”  RELATED VIDEO: Women of Hollywood Attend Golden Globes Together in Support of the Time’s Up Movement  The claims against Lauer came as hundreds of women and men — including Rose McGowan, Ashley Judd, Terry Crews and Anthony Rapp — have publicly came forward about alleged sexual misconduct at the hands of powerful men in Hollywood, including Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey.  The movement inspired the new Time’s Up initiative and legal defense fund that was created to help victims of sexual misconduct pursue legal action against their perpetrators. Time’s Up was a major focus at this year’s Golden Globes, where almost all the famous attendees wore black to raise awareness about the cause.  “I think it was really moving to see so many women support each other and demand change, not only for themselves, but for mistreated and marginalized women in all kinds of industries,” Couric tells PEOPLE about Time’s Up. “Clearly we are witnessing a sea change and a long overdue course correction.”  She also said that one of the new of the episodes of her upcoming six-part documentary Nat Geo series will focus on harassment women have experienced in their workplaces.  “One of my Nat Geo episodes explores the various obstacles that are holding women back in Hollywood, Silicon Valley and beyond,” she says. “I just interviewed Elisabeth Moss about this.

""It's your 60th birthday and this gift had to be really special and it had to represent who you are and what you really care about,"" Portia explains. ""Not just now, but what you've always cared about. What you were influenced by and what has made you the amazing person that you are today. So, I combined that and questions when we first met like, 'Who's your idol? And what would you do if you weren't a talk show host?'"" She continues, ""So, I combined that with the fact that literally guys, for, like, the last two years, Ellen has said to me, 'I feel like I'm not doing enough.' Every day, almost. So, I put all that together and I got you this gift. So, let's see it -- happy birthday!"" Portia then cuts to a video of her talking about Ellen's hero, Dian Fossey, and her dedication to animals. ""So, for your birthday, Ellen, I am bringing you and your hero, Dian, together by building the Ellen DeGeneres Campus of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund,"" she reveals. ""Ellen, you will carry on Dian's legacy by giving them a permanent home in Rwanda. Now, you will join Dian as a protector and champion of these amazing animals, the mountain gorillas. Happy birthday!"" Portia didn't stop there! ""I have also set up a foundation in your name called The Ellen DeGeneres Wildlife Fund,"" she shares. ""So, this is the first initiative for the fund that you can take this and do whatever you want with it. You've done amazing work for elephants and you can just continue and support whatever you want to do."" Blown over by the gift, Ellen says tearfully, ""It’s the best gift. I’ve always said -- and when we got married, Portia’s line was, 'It’s good to be loved; it’s profound to be understood' -- and, she understands me because that is the best gift that anybody could have given me. So, I love you.""

Brothers, James Stanford Poore, 32, and Cedric Dwayne Poore, 39, were arrested and booked on four complaints each of first degree murder, Chief Chuck Jordan said.  On Monday, January 7, 2013, twin sisters Rebeika Powell and Kayetie Powell-Melchor, 23; Misty Nunley, 33, and Julie Jackson, 55 were found shot in the head, with their hands tied behind their backs inside a south Tulsa apartment, police say. A 3-year-old boy was also found inside the apartment, unharmed.  Chief Jordan said the murders were not gang-related. According to arrest reports, witnesses told investigators that the brothers left an apartment in the same building at Fairmont Terrace Apartments, near 61st and Peoria, saying they were going to pull a ""lick"" at the victims' apartment.  Witnesses told police the brothers returned about 20 minutes later with a bag full of drugs, cash, and jewelry. According to the report, James Poore told the witnesses that he shot one of the victims because she could identify him and that Cedric shot the other three. The witnesses told investigators the brothers split the money and that Cedric Poore took the jewelry to pawn.    When he was interviewed Wednesday, James Poore confirmed to investigators that he knew one of the victims and that he was in the apartment where the witnesses placed him. Before invoking his right to remain silent, he told investigators he knew one of the victims had used and sold illegal drugs and that Cedric drove a black van to the apartment the day of the murders.    The arrest report shows Cedric Poore denied being in the apartment the day of the murders and refused to speak to investigators any more.  Chief Jordan said the brothers both stayed at Fairmont Terrace Apartments. The property manager there told News On 6 that neither of them are on a lease.  Cedric Poore has been in Tulsa County jail on a traffic violation since January 14, and James Poore was arrested Wednesday morning. Department of Corrections records show both James and Cedric have been previously convicted and incarcerated for robbery with a firearm.  Chief Jordan said more arrests may still be made.  Mayor Dewey Bartlett released a statement Wednesday afternoon, in response to the news of the arrests:    ""The Tulsa Police Department is known for their quick efforts of finding perpetrators and they indeed lived up to their stellar reputation for this case. I have the utmost confidence in Chief Chuck Jordan and the Tulsa Police Department and I knew they would bring in those involved with this hideous quadruple murder in very short order. Although a direct tip from the public cannot be identified as the catalyst that led to the arrests, tips are always important, which is part of great police work from our force.""",1,en,"Two arrests have been made in the murders of four women at Fairmont Terrace Apartments last month, police announced Wednesday afternoon.

The arrest report shows Cedric Poore denied being in the apartment the day of the murders and refused to speak to investigators any more.  Chief Jordan said the brothers both stayed at Fairmont Terrace Apartments. The property manager there told News On 6 that neither of them are on a lease.  Cedric Poore has been in Tulsa County jail on a traffic violation since January 14, and James Poore was arrested Wednesday morning. Department of Corrections records show both James and Cedric have been previously convicted and incarcerated for robbery with a firearm.  Chief Jordan said more arrests may still be made.  Mayor Dewey Bartlett released a statement Wednesday afternoon, in response to the news of the arrests:    ""The Tulsa Police Department is known for their quick efforts of finding perpetrators and they indeed lived up to their stellar reputation for this case. I have the utmost confidence in Chief Chuck Jordan and the Tulsa Police Department and I knew they would bring in those involved with this hideous quadruple murder in very short order. Although a direct tip from the public cannot be identified as the catalyst that led to the arrests, tips are always important, which is part of great police work from our force.""","Police have announced that two arrests have been made in connection with the murders of four women at Fairmont Terrace Apartments last month. The suspects, James Stanford Poore, 32, and Cedric Dwayne Poore, 39, have been booked on four charges each of first degree murder. Chief Chuck Jordan stated that the murders were not gang-related. Witnesses informed investigators that the brothers left an apartment in the same building as the victims, claiming they were going to commit a crime. They returned 20 minutes later with drugs, cash, and jewelry. It is alleged that James Poore confessed to shooting one victim and Cedric shot the other three. Witnesses also reported that the brothers divided the money and Cedric pawned the jewelry. James Poore admitted to knowing one of the victims and being present at the scene before exercising his right to remain silent. Cedric Poore denied being at the scene and refused to cooperate further. Both brothers were residents of Fairmont Terrace Apartments, although they were not on a lease. Cedric Poore had been in jail since January 14 for a traffic violation, while James Poore was arrested on Wednesday morning. Both have previous convictions for robbery with a firearm. Chief Jordan stated that further arrests may follow. Mayor Dewey Bartlett commended the Tulsa Police Department for their prompt action in solving the case, although it is unclear if public tips played a role in the arrests."

The news arrives about three months after the model revealed she and and her longtime boyfriend became engaged.  The model has kept her relationship with Kushner fairly private since the pair began dating. While most people are aware of Kushner's famous White House connection, Kloss' husband is still a bit of an enigma. Here's everything you need to know about Joshua Kushner:  1. His brother is Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump's husband—but he doesn't share their politics.  Despite keeping a relatively low profile himself, Joshua's older brother, Jared, has been making a name for himself in the Trump administration as a senior advisor. However, Joshua doesn't share Jared's political views.  ""It is no secret that liberal values have guided my life and that I have supported political leaders that share similar values,"" the 33-year-old revealed in a 2017 Forbes interview. ""But neither political party has a monopoly on the truth or on constructive ideas for our country. It's important to be open minded and learn from differing opinions.""  Forbes also reported that the Democrat did not vote for Trump in the 2016 election. According to The Daily Mail, ""Josh and Jared’s parents were Democratic donors until 2016.""  It seems as though Joshua shares his wife's political views—Kloss was vocal about voting for Hillary Clinton. She regularly gets involved in political campaigns, with Joshua supporting her at political marches including March for Our Lives in 2018.  2. He's been dating Kloss since 2012.  According to Bustle, Kloss and Kushner first met in June 8, 2012, with the model revealing on the same date in 2016, ""Four years ago today I met my best friend. I love you more everyday.""  Rumors about their relationship initially started when Kushner attended a Victoria's Secret Fashion Show afterparty in November 2012, with Us Weekly reporting via a source that, ""They are really cute together. [Kushner] seemed nervous and shy around everyone but handled it well. Karlie is stunning and the sweetest girl ever. She stuck close to him.""  Of keeping her relationship private, Kloss told Porter in April 2018, ""I know in my life what really matters to me. I'm not trying to hide that from the world; I just really like having a more private, private life. I've got nothing to hide, though!""  The couple recently made a rare public appearance together at the 2018 Met Gala.  3. The Kushner family's net worth is estimated at $1.8 billion.  Forbes estimated in 2016 that the Kushners were worth $1.8 billion, with their main sources of income being real estate ($1.15 billion) and venture capital investments ($420 million). $240 million of that share comes from Oscar, a millennial-focused health insurance company Josh founded in 2012. However, CNBC reported in March that the start-up is now valued at $3.2 billion.  According to Celebrity Net Worth, Josh Kushner's net worth is $800 million, although the accuracy of that exact figure is unclear.  Kloss' new husband also co-founded investment firm Thrive Capital, which has ties to Instagram. He's also a graduate of Harvard Business School.  Of his business ventures, Kushner told Ariana Huffington in 2015, ""It's incredibly difficult to build a business... I think it's important to kind of ignore when people say good things about you especially in this industry... Just be incredibly focused.""  4. Kloss converted to Judaism for Kushner.

In an interview with the Hollywood Reporter, Kendall revealed that even the crew members often cry when the Kardashian women open up about their personal struggles. The crew, ranging from a single camera operator to a team of thirty, closely observes their every move. They were also witnesses to Kendall's reaction to the controversial Pepsi advertisement she received backlash for, although Kendall never allowed herself to be seen crying on camera. Kim emphasized the close relationship between the family and the crew, noting that they witness everything. Ultimately, only the crew members know the true emotions behind the scenes, as the public has not seen any evidence of Kendall's reactions or statements regarding the criticism she faced."

The source claims that there is a great deal of drama behind the scenes, with Hudson being described as a difficult person to work with. The insider also reveals that Miley Cyrus and Blake Shelton often speak poorly of her behind her back, which Hudson is well aware of. Despite all this, Hudson maintains a low profile when the cameras are not rolling."

Kim Kardashian, a popular target for criticism, recently received a wry comment about her self-absorption on Twitter. Instead of responding aggressively or ignoring it, Kardashian chose to disarmingly agree with the commenter, showcasing her sense of self-awareness.

The country superstar opened up about his romance with the No Doubt frontwoman in a new interview with Billboard magazine.  As previously reported, Shelton told Stefani that he was splitting from Lambert during a meeting with their Voice coworkers. The “Misery” singer, who was new to the team at the time, got emotional.  “I won’t forget that day. I looked over at Gwen — who I didn’t really know — and she had these huge tears in her eyes. I thought, ‘Wow, she feels super bad for me!’” Shelton recalled. “She didn’t tell me much, because we didn’t know each other at the time, but she said, ‘I’m going through something very similar to what you’re going through. I understand. And I hate it.’”  Stefani was dealing with her own breakup at the time with Gavin Rossdale. (As Us Weekly exclusively revealed, the Bush rocker was cheating on her with their children’s nanny, Mindy Mann.) They announced they were ending their 13-year marriage in August 2015, one month after Shelton and Lambert announced they were divorcing after four years.  The “Came Here to Forget” singer and Stefani leaned on each other for support during the difficult time. The closer they got, the more Shelton saw Stefani in a new light.  “That’s kind of how our friendship and bond started, that day. It went from that, to checking in on each other once a week through email — ‘This s–t happened to me, what happened to you?’ — to maybe three times a week, then every day, to ‘Hey, here’s my phone number if you ever want to text,’” Shelton told Billboard. “Next thing I know, I wake up and she’s all I care about, and I’m ­wondering if she feels the same about me.”  “Gwen saved my life,” he added. “Who else on earth could understand going through a high-profile divorce from another musician? You can’t even imagine the similarities in our divorces.”  The two teamed up professionally too. Shelton included their collaborative track, “Go Ahead and Break My Heart,” on his 12th studio album, If I’m Honest.  “When we recorded the vocals for some of these songs, I was only six months removed from when all the crap went down,” Shelton said of his split from Lambert. “When you have a broken heart — at least, when I do — you got to get it out of your system. You want people to sympathize with you.

As previously reported, the coroner confirmed to Us that the Glee alum died on Tuesday, January 30. Salling was found by a riverbed in the Sunland-Tujunga neighborhood of L.A., and was pronounced dead at the scene. Us confirmed that one of Salling’s family members reported him missing at 3 a.m. before his body was discovered on Tuesday.  The 35-year-old actor, who pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography involving a prepubescent minor in December 2017, was set to be sentenced on March 7. In October, he agreed to a plea deal that included four to seven years in jail. According to the court documents previously obtained by Us, Salling was also ordered to pay approximately $50,000 in restitution and register as a sex offender after his stint in jail.  However, a source close to his child pornography case explained to Us on Wednesday, January 31, that Salling’s estate might not have to pay his victims because he was not sentenced before his death.  “Restitution would be a part of his sentence. The amount of the restitution is determined by the sentencing judge … He will not be sentenced. Therefore there will be no restitution order,” the insider told Us. “Therefore I doubt that there is anything to take to civil court. Any restitution order would be allocated among multiple known victims.”  The source added, “I’m not saying that there isn’t some lawyer out there willing to file suit on behalf of someone claiming to be a victim. But I am saying, that there is no order to be enforced, for $50,000 or any other amount on behalf of anyone.”  Criminal defense attorney Troy Slaten, who is not directly involved in Salling’s case, further explained that Salling’s victims would have to file a suit in civil court to pursue any restitution.  “Any victims can sue his estate in civil court and receive monetary awards for damages. These awards … can be in the neighborhood of hundred of thousands of dollars or even in the millions,” Slaten said. They have to file suit in civil court, if they have not already, which they want to do quickly, because you do not want the estate to distribute assets. That would make it more difficult to collect.”  If you or someone you know is in emotional distress or suicidal crisis, please call the Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).

Summary At Winterfell At Winterfell, Arya Stark talks to her sister Sansa Stark about borrowing Bran Stark's bow and arrow. She tells Sansa that she practiced several times until she finally hit the bullseye. Arya recalls that their father Eddard Stark had been watching and clapped his hands in praise of her accomplishments. Arya reasons that their father knew that the rules were wrong but that his daughter was in the right. She then confronts Sansa about her alleged role in their father's death. Arya presents the letter that Sansa had written to their late brother Robb Stark urging him to come and bend the knee to King Joffrey Baratheon. Sansa replies that the Queen Mother Cersei Lannister forced her to do it under duress. Arya counters that she was not tortured and that she saw Sansa at Ned's execution; Sansa retorts that Arya did nothing to stop their father's execution either. Arya chastises Sansa for betraying their family but Sansa responds that they have only returned to Winterfell because of her, while Arya travelled the world in pursuit of her own agenda. Sansa adds that their half-brother Jon Snow was saved from defeat when Petyr Baelish and the Knights of the Vale came to their rescue and insists Arya would not have survived the torments she endured at the hands of Joffrey and Ramsay. Sansa demands to know where Arya found the letter and chides her younger sister that Cersei would be pleased to see them fighting but Arya is still bitter towards Sansa. She realizes that while Jon would understand the difficult circumstances Sansa was under when she wrote the letter, Sansa is afraid the Northern lords will discover it and turn on her, including Lyanna Mormont. Arya adds that Lyanna is younger than Sansa was when she wrote this letter but argues Lyanna wouldn't agree with Sansa's defense that she was a child at the time. While recognizing that Sansa wrote the letter out of fear, a bitter Arya says that she prefers to embrace anger over fear. Later, Sansa asks Petyr Baelish about where Arya got the letter from, unaware that Baelish orchestrated the entire incident. Sansa tells Petyr that she is commanding 20,000 men who answer to Jon but not to her. Petyr tells Sansa that the men will trust her because she can rule. Sansa does not trust the loyalty of the Northern lords, citing their history of switching sides. She counters that the discovery of the letter will turn her liege lords and men against her. Sansa confides in Petyr about her strained relations with Arya. Petyr suggests that Sansa talk to Brienne of Tarth because she has sworn to protect both of Lady Catelyn Stark's daughters from harm's way. Trusting Baelish, Sansa accepts his advice. The following morning, Maester Wolkan informs Sansa that they have received a letter from Queen Cersei. Sansa meets with Brienne, who advises her not to leave Winterfell. Instead, Sansa decides to send Brienne as her representative since she could reason with Jaime Lannister. Brienne warns that it is too dangerous for her to leave Sansa alone at Winterfell with Petyr. Sansa insists that her guards and men are loyal to her but Brienne warns that Petyr might be bribing them behind her back. Brienne offers to leave her squire Podrick Payne, whose swordsmanship has improved, but Sansa insists that she can take care of herself.

Arya tells Sansa that she obtained the faces from the Faceless Men of Braavos and admits she spent time training to be a Faceless Man. She forces Sansa to play the lying game and begins by asking if she thinks that Jon is the rightful King. Sansa demands that Arya tell her what the ""faces"" are. Arya replies that they always wanted to pretend to be other people. Sansa wanted to be a queen while Arya herself wanted to be a knight. In the end, neither of them got what they wanted. Arya says that the faces allow her to become someone else and toys with the idea of assuming Sansa's face and status. Arya approaches Sansa with her dagger and muses as the possibility of becoming the Lady of Winterfell. However, Arya relents and leaves a disturbed Sansa alone with the dagger. The Wight Hunt At Dragonstone castle, Queen Daenerys Targaryen and her Hand Tyrion Lannister chat in the Chamber of the Painted Table. Daenerys tells Tyrion that she appreciates the fact that he is not a hero because they have a tendency of risking their lives to do dangerous things. She compares Tyrion favorably to ""heroes"" such as Khal Drogo, Ser Jorah Mormont, Daario Naharis and Jon Snow, most of whom ""do stupid things, trying to outdo the others"". Tyrion, slightly amused, notes that all of those individuals fell in love with Daenerys, but she dismisses the obvious implication that Jon Snow is in love with her – to which Tyrion sarcastically quips that Jon must be staring so longingly at her because he is so eager for a military alliance. Daenerys remarks that Jon is too little for her tastes, but immediately apologizes when she realizes she's accidentally insulted Tyrion's height. Daenerys also recognizes that Tyrion is no coward.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. BERNARD SHAW, CNN ANCHOR: After three days of speeches, this Republican Convention and delegates prepare for the big one. JUDY WOODRUFF, CNN ANCHOR: Delegates are on their way to the convention hall anxious to hear what George W. Bush will say to them and to the rest of the country. ANNOUNCER: Tonight from Philadelphia, the 37th Republican National Convention; 2000 delegates, 10,000 volunteers, and 15,000 media members have converged on the cradle of American democracy for the nomination of the GOP candidates for president and vice president of the United States. In this grand old city, the Grand Old Party of Lincoln, Eisenhower and Reagan starts its quest for the White House, led by a man with Texas roots and a president's name. Now, from Philadelphia's First Union Center, here are CNN's Bernard Shaw, Judy Woodruff, and Jeff Greenfield. SHAW: And welcome to this grand finale night. Judy, Jeff, my mother used to say, it's not what you say, it's how you say it. WOODRUFF: That's right. We already actually have a few tips about what Governor George W. Bush is going to say tonight. His campaign put out a release already, which we can tell you, they say he's going to say, among other things: ""Times of plenty, like times of crisis, are tests of American character."" And Jeff, he will speak with regret about what has happened in the last eight years and say opportunities missed, time and again. JEFF GREENFIELD, CNN SENIOR ANALYST: Opportunities squandered, as Dick Cheney, said last night. You know, it is probably true that tonight -- and in two weeks at the Democratic Convention -- more Americans will spend more time listening to a sustained rhetorical argument than at any other time in the year. This is the one time an impatient political process slows down and lets a candidate for president talk to us. It is a very significant moment. WOODRUFF: And those people who perhaps have not been paying close attention to this campaign up until now will begin tonight to pay serious attention. GREENFIELD: This is when they tune in and say, I wonder if this guy is the guy I'll trust. It's a big one. WOODRUFF: As this convention has been going on, of course, we at CNN of course have been keeping a close watch on the story at a hospital here in Philadelphia -- former President Gerald Ford recovering from a stroke, minor stroke. Today, he had some visitors. Governor George W. Bush dropped by, met with some of the hospital staff. We also know that Bob Dole, who was the nominee at the Republican Convention four years, also came by to see the former president to pay his respects. And Jim Nicholson, who is the chairman of the Republican National Committee was there as well. GREENFIELD: But as we said, tonight is the tonight when George Bush gives his acceptance speech. We want to go down to the floor to get a sense of what the delegates might be thinking about, and certainly what our floor reporters are thinking about. And on the condition that you do not tell us that he has to be presidential, Jeanne Meserve, what's going on at this convention, and what's going to happen? JEANNE MESERVE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Jeff, of course George W. Bush will be defining his message tonight. But we've been hearing parts of it all week from the stage, but also from the floor. And it turns out there's a good reason why. We've been told that in several states, the party has sent out talking points to the delegates before this convention began, telling them to stress party unity and inclusion, telling them to underline certain issues, especially that the election of George W. Bush would restore morality to the oval office. Some of the delegates don't like it. One of them said: We are nothing more than props in a huge movie production.

And Jeff, he will speak with regret about what has happened in the last eight years and say opportunities missed, time and again. JEFF GREENFIELD, CNN SENIOR ANALYST: Opportunities squandered, as Dick Cheney, said last night. You know, it is probably true that tonight -- and in two weeks at the Democratic Convention -- more Americans will spend more time listening to a sustained rhetorical argument than at any other time in the year. This is the one time an impatient political process slows down and lets a candidate for president talk to us. It is a very significant moment. WOODRUFF: And those people who perhaps have not been paying close attention to this campaign up until now will begin tonight to pay serious attention. GREENFIELD: This is when they tune in and say, I wonder if this guy is the guy I'll trust. It's a big one. WOODRUFF: As this convention has been going on, of course, we at CNN of course have been keeping a close watch on the story at a hospital here in Philadelphia -- former President Gerald Ford recovering from a stroke, minor stroke. Today, he had some visitors. Governor George W. Bush dropped by, met with some of the hospital staff. We also know that Bob Dole, who was the nominee at the Republican Convention four years, also came by to see the former president to pay his respects. And Jim Nicholson, who is the chairman of the Republican National Committee was there as well. GREENFIELD: But as we said, tonight is the tonight when George Bush gives his acceptance speech. We want to go down to the floor to get a sense of what the delegates might be thinking about, and certainly what our floor reporters are thinking about. And on the condition that you do not tell us that he has to be presidential, Jeanne Meserve, what's going on at this convention, and what's going to happen? JEANNE MESERVE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Jeff, of course George W. Bush will be defining his message tonight. But we've been hearing parts of it all week from the stage, but also from the floor. And it turns out there's a good reason why. We've been told that in several states, the party has sent out talking points to the delegates before this convention began, telling them to stress party unity and inclusion, telling them to underline certain issues, especially that the election of George W. Bush would restore morality to the oval office. Some of the delegates don't like it. One of them said: We are nothing more than props in a huge movie production. We have also been told that, in some delegations, there were heavy-handed attempts to persuade the McCain delegates to vote for Bush. Some resisted and only changed their minds after a personal appeal from Cindy McCain. Again, some delegates don't like it. One of them resents the orchestration, the effort to quash dissent. He said, at this convention, there is absolutely no meaningful role for a delegate to play. Now onto Candy Crowley. CANDY CROWLEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: To say that this is an important night for George Bush understates the case. This is one really of three pivotal moments that in the past have either made or broken a presidential candidate: The selection of a vice president, the convention speech, and the fall debates are considered the three key moments for any campaign. So George Bush has been practicing this speech, has been rewriting this speech for weeks, even more than a month now. What Bush must do is play both to the people in this room; that is, mostly the more conservative members of this party, as well as reach out to those who will, in fact, decide the election, the swing voters. We are told this will be a subtler speech than Secretary Cheney's speech was last night; that, in fact, Bush will outline his agenda. He may take a poke or two at Al Gore about the Internet. But beyond that, what you are going to hear tonight is a direct appeal to the swing voters. George Bush is the key face in the new face of the Republican Party, and that is the face that we will see tonight. And now onto my colleague, Frank Sesno. FRANK SESNO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Now, to talk about what George W. Bush will say tonight, in talking to speech-writers, there is a very distinct artform,"
gossipcop-5866775064,"On the same day rumors spread that there’s trouble in paradise for Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani, another shocking report claims Miranda Lambert is desperately trying to meet up with her ex!  It’s been more than two years since Blake Shelton, 40, and Miranda Lambert, 33, ended their marriage, but she’s finally ready to sit down and hash things out, according to a new report. Amidst new rumors that Blake is having trouble in his relationship with Gwen Stefani, 47, an insider tells InTouch that Miranda wants to confront her ex to finally get closure. “It needs to be done,” the source tells the mag. “There’s still a lot of unfinished business between [Miranda] and Blake. She needs to look straight into Blake’s eyes, ask certain questions, and get answers.”  There are no plans set for this meeting to actually take place just yet, but the mag claims that if it does happen, Miranda plans to go in with a “clear head,” although that might not be so easy. “This could get heated,” the insider admits. “As soon as the emotions come up, [Miranda] may lose it.” This doesn’t mean the 33-year-old wants to get back together with her ex, though — actually, it’s just the opposite. She’s very happy with her man, Anderson East, 29, but feels a face-to-face with Blake is what she needs to fully be ready to commit to another relationship, according to the source.  “She feels that [she and Blake] have both grown so much since their divorce that meeting up is essential for them to have healthy relationships in the future,” InTouch’s insider says. “Who knows, maybe this meeting with Blake will have them walk away as friends. Either way, they’ll definitely be in a better place.”  As for the rumored trouble between Blake and Gwen, we’re going to take that report (from OK! magazine) with a grain of salt. After all, they were just spotted looking totally in love on Aug. 20! Plus, HollywoodLife.com has heard EXCLUSIVELY that they already have plans for a fun Labor Day together, so hopefully he’ll pop back up on her social media this weekend!

According to reports, Miranda wants to address unresolved issues and seek closure by having a face-to-face conversation with Blake. Although they have not made concrete plans for this meeting, Miranda intends to approach it with a calm mindset, even though emotions might arise. It is important to note that Miranda has no intention of rekindling her romance with Blake, as she is currently content with her boyfriend, Anderson East. However, she believes that this meeting will allow her to fully commit to her current relationship and facilitate healthier connections with both Blake and future partners. The insider suggests that this interaction may even help them to remain friends.

According to a witness in LA, Corey was simply following Kris around while holding her handbag, as if Kris barely acknowledged his presence. Unfortunately for Kris, it is believed that Corey, who used to work as Justin Bieber's road manager, was the one who initiated their breakup. A source from Star magazine claims that Kris had been persistently nagging Corey about various issues, including him not spending enough time with her, which eventually led him to reach his breaking point. Kris is reportedly devastated by the breakup, as she dislikes being alone and is desperate to maintain the appearance of a perfect relationship.

gossipcop-4524134287,"No need to rush. Jennifer Lopez is not in a hurry to walk down the aisle with Alex Rodriguez, but she does want to spend the rest of her life with someone.  “I do believe in marriage,” the Shades of Blue actress, 48, told Harper’s Bazaar in a story published on Thursday, March 15. “And I would love to grow old with somebody in a committed relationship. But I’m not forcing anything right now.”  As far as her relationship with the 42-year-old former Yankees player, she said: “It’s good, it’s healthy; we communicate well. We understand each other’s lives in a way that most other people couldn’t.”  She added: “We both entered the public eye in our early twenties and overachieved right from the start. And that affects every dynamic in your life, from your family to your work to your relationships. We have a similar makeup.”  The pair celebrated their anniversary in February in Minneapolis, where the singer performed a concert ahead of the Super Bowl. During the show, she debuted her single “Us” written by Poo Bear and produced by Skrillex, and dedicated it to Rodriguez, who was in the audience. “We’ve been together for one year today. I don’t want to get all mushy or anything, but baby, this song’s for you. I love you,” she told the athlete while on stage.  When talking about how she chose the song, Lopez told the magazine that the lyrics fit right into where the couple were in their relationship. She said: “They played me about 20 different songs, and when I heard this one I was like, ‘Oh, this is relevant!’ Alex and I were just getting to know each other. And I was like, ‘Oh, my God, could this be? Could this be us?’”  Lopez was previously married to chef Ojani Noa for nearly a year in 1997, and dancer Cris Judd from 2001 to 2002.

I also know my strengths and weaknesses. It took me a long time to get to a point where I could say something nice about myself.

gossipcop-5658990975,"Daniel Craig is returning as James Bond once again, even as he reportedly fights to save his marriage to Rachel Weisz at the same time. Craig has already announced his intent to return as 007 in the franchise’s 25th film, and according to the National Enquirer, he’s still struggling to salvage what’s left of his marriage.  The Enquirer’s source claimed at the beginning of 2017, “Rachel and Daniel haven’t been happy for a while, and nearly called it quits last year.” The report claims that the married couple was in two separate filming locations at the beginning of the year, but continued to stay apart even after wrapping their respective films. The Enquirer then claims that they finally reunited in July after not being seen together in ‘554 days’.  According to the sources, the minute the outlet attempted to lock down an exclusive on the couple’s rocky marriage, both Rachel Weisz and Daniel Craig were seen arriving at New York’s Public Theater the next day, prompting the source to add, “The whole thing just seemed like too much of a coincidence. I don’t buy it for a minute.”  When you consider Daniel Craig’s own words, especially in the context of allegedly turning down a $150 million payday to star in two more James Bond films, he had stated, “Being on your own would be sad, sick, and weird. I don’t trust myself. I need that balance.” If these reports are to be believed, then Daniel Craig previously turned down starring in more Bond films to spend time with his family, but now – all of a sudden – he’s back to working on James Bond?  Either the report was never accurate to begin with, or he’s giving up on his marriage to Rachel Weisz. One would hope that the two have worked out whatever was troubling them in the first place, but given their own relationship and marriage histories – and how they’ve both jumped ship on long-term relationships at the drop of a hat – one wouldn’t be faulted for assuming that they are on their way to getting a divorce.  What do you guys think? Are Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz having marriage troubles, and is Daniel’s decision to take on the role of 007 again an indication that he’s giving up on his marriage? Or just a chance to have more career stability and/or cash in on a major paycheck? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.  Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images for Sony Pictures",1,en,"Daniel Craig is returning as James Bond once again, even as he reportedly fights to save his marriage to Rachel Weisz at the same time. Craig has already announced his intent to return as 007 in the franchise’s 25th film, and according to the National Enquirer, he’s still struggling to salvage what’s left of his marriage.  The Enquirer’s source claimed at the beginning of 2017, “Rachel and Daniel haven’t been happy for a while, and nearly called it quits last year.” The report claims that the married couple was in two separate filming locations at the beginning of the year, but continued to stay apart even after wrapping their respective films. The Enquirer then claims that they finally reunited in July after not being seen together in ‘554 days’.  According to the sources, the minute the outlet attempted to lock down an exclusive on the couple’s rocky marriage, both Rachel Weisz and Daniel Craig were seen arriving at New York’s Public Theater the next day, prompting the source to add, “The whole thing just seemed like too much of a coincidence. I don’t buy it for a minute.”  When you consider Daniel Craig’s own words, especially in the context of allegedly turning down a $150 million payday to star in two more James Bond films, he had stated, “Being on your own would be sad, sick, and weird. I don’t trust myself. I need that balance.” If these reports are to be believed, then Daniel Craig previously turned down starring in more Bond films to spend time with his family, but now – all of a sudden – he’s back to working on James Bond?

Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images for Sony Pictures","Daniel Craig is set to reprise his role as James Bond, despite reports of marital issues with his wife Rachel Weisz. He has announced his involvement in the 25th Bond film, but according to the National Enquirer, their marriage is facing difficulties. The couple allegedly had a rough patch and almost broke up last year. Even when they were filming in different locations at the beginning of the year, they continued to live separately after completing their respective projects. However, they were seen together in public in July after 554 days apart, which some find suspicious. The Enquirer suggests that their sudden reunion was prompted by the outlet's attempt to obtain an exclusive about their troubled marriage. In the past, Craig has expressed the importance of having a balanced personal life and previously declined a huge payday to spend time with his family. The decision to return to the Bond franchise raises questions about his commitment to his marriage. It is unclear whether the initial report was accurate or if Craig is giving up on his relationship. While one would hope they have resolved their problems, considering their past histories of ending long-term relationships, it wouldn't be surprising if they were headed for a divorce. What do you think? Are Craig and Weisz experiencing marital troubles, and does Craig's decision to play Bond again indicate the end of their marriage? Or is it simply a chance for him to have career stability and earn a significant paycheck? Share your thoughts in the comments."

gossipcop-4774142356,"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired.

T","Katie Holmes is facing a challenging situation, as rumors circulate regarding her relationships with Jamie Foxx, Tom Cruise, and their daughter Suri. According to RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of getting married, planning a grand ceremony with Suri as a bridesmaid. This event would have solidified their relationship, which had been mostly covert for the past five years. However, Holmes discovered that Foxx was not ready to give up his bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with his ex-girlfriend Kristin Grannis, who is the mother of his daughter. This realization prompted Holmes to call off the wedding and break up with Foxx. A source informed RadarOnline that Foxx was reluctant to sign a prenuptial agreement with a no-cheating clause, as it would have been costly for him to be unfaithful. Holmes noticed a lack of respect in Foxx's behavior, which she deemed unhealthy for herself and Suri, leading her to protect them by ending the relationship. Simultaneously, it seems that Holmes has been dealing with Cruise's attempts to reconnect with Suri. According to Star magazine and Hollywood Life, Cruise was separated from his daughter due to the influence of his Church of Scientology superiors. Despite being a loyal Scientologist, Cruise is tired of being controlled and misses out on her life. Holmes, however, does not want a reunion as she made an agreement with Cruise to stay quiet about him and Scientology as long as he stays away from Suri and doesn't try to indoctrinate her into the controversial organization. Nevertheless, Holmes is torn because she wants what is best for Suri and believes that her daughter is missing her father. Ultimately, Holmes may be considering the possibility of a reunion. Representatives for Holmes have denied the reports about the breakup with Foxx and the potential reunion with Cruise and Suri. However, it is worth noting that Holmes' publicist, Leslie Sloane, personally denied the breakup report, which carries significance since it is the first official acknowledgment of their relationship from either Holmes or Foxx. The couple had kept their relationship a secret since 2013, with Holmes even wearing disguises to meet Foxx in public. The secrecy was necessary due to a divorce settlement agreement with Cruise that prohibited Holmes from publicly dating anyone for five years. Speculation arose in September 2017 when Holmes and Foxx were photographed together on a beach, suggesting that the previously imposed dating ban had ended."
gossipcop-897813,"There's a LOT of action packed into these 15 seconds.  The first ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"" trailer comes out this Thursday, Dec. 7.

gossipcop-920346,"Craig Mack, the rapper who had the first hit on P. Diddy’s iconic hip-hop label Bad Boy Records, died on Monday. He was 47.  According to the New York Daily News, the rapper died of heart failure at his Walterboro, South Carolina home. His death was confirmed by Mack’s former producer Alvin Toney.  “Craig Mack, you were the first artist to release music on Bad Boy and gave us our first hit,” Sean “Diddy” Combs tells Rolling Stone in a statement. “You always followed your heart and you had an energy that was out of this world. You believed in me and you believed in Bad Boy. I will never forget what you did for hip-hop. You inspired me, and I will continue to try to keep inspiring others. We will always love you.”  Mack is best known for the indelible classic “Flava in Ya Ear,” – a Top 10 hit in 1994 that sold over a million copies – and its subsequent remix featuring Notorious B.I.G, LL Cool J, Busta Rhymes and Rampage. The original would eventually reach No. 1 on the Billboard rap songs chart and No. 9 on the Hot 100 and earn a Best Rap Solo Performance Grammy nomination. “Craig is hip-hop’s George Clinton, because his stuff is really off the wall,” Diddy once told The New York Times. “He does what’s from his heart, which is where it starts for him. But his energy comes from somewhere else.”  Mack, born in the Bronx in 1970, helped make Bad Boy Records synonymous with New York hip-hop, kickstarting the label that would eventually make stars of Notorious B.I.G., Mase, 112 and more. In a 1995 profile in The New York Times, Mack said he was hooked on rap by his cousins at age nine and began to write his own lyrics at age 12. “I knew I wanted to be like LL Cool J and Run-D.M.C.,” Mack recalled.  He became friendly with members of another famous New York rap group, EPMD, and accompanied them on tour. He did odd jobs for the group and did not perform, but Mack still remembered the experience as a valuable one. “All the time I was getting an education learning about the studio and the road,” he explained.  Mack first started rhyming in the late 1980s. Under the name MC EZ, listed alongside DJ Troup, he released a single 12-inch on Fresh Records in 1988: “Just Rhymin'” b/w “Get Retarded.” The nimble B-side would become a fave among rap fans and was interpolated by Dr. Dre and LL Cool J for the single “Zoom.” Mack eventually met Diddy – who was at that time looking to set up Bad Boy after being fired from Uptown Records – outside the club Mecca in Manhattan. Mack freestyled for Diddy and earned a record contract.  After breaking through with “Flava in Ya Ear” and its accompanying gold-certified album Project: Funk Da World, Mack struggled to replicate his initial success. He left Bad Boy Records and released Operation: Get Down in 1997 but did not score a hit from the album. Mack later appeared in the video for Diddy’s hit “I Need a Girl Part 1,” but his solo career never regained momentum.  Mack eventually became a minister in South Carolina and appeared to renounce his former life as a rapper in a 2012 video. The video, taken at the Overcomer Ministry commune in Walterboro, S.C., shows the group’s pastor Ralph Gordon Stair talking to Mack. “Craig Mack is dead,” Stair tells the congregation. “We have somebody that used to be Craig Mack.”  In Can’t Stop, Won’t Stop: The Bad Boy Story, the 2017 documentary chronicling the rise of Combs’ revered label and reunion tour, Mack can be heard discussing the possibility of returning to the stage, but declined because of his religious beliefs.  “I don’t think anybody was disappointed,” Combs told Billboard last year. “We kind of respected his wishes. In this game, man, people don’t realize the music industry only has a one percent rate ratio, so sometimes it’s very stressful and it brings you only to places that you can go to and should go to, which is God. We can respect that because if any of us is still here, we’d have to go to him, too.

But his energy comes from somewhere else.”  Mack, born in the Bronx in 1970, helped make Bad Boy Records synonymous with New York hip-hop, kickstarting the label that would eventually make stars of Notorious B.I.G., Mase, 112 and more. In a 1995 profile in The New York Times, Mack said he was hooked on rap by his cousins at age nine and began to write his own lyrics at age 12. “I knew I wanted to be like LL Cool J and Run-D.M.C.,” Mack recalled.  He became friendly with members of another famous New York rap group, EPMD, and accompanied them on tour. He did odd jobs for the group and did not perform, but Mack still remembered the experience as a valuable one. “All the time I was getting an education learning about the studio and the road,” he explained.  Mack first started rhyming in the late 1980s. Under the name MC EZ, listed alongside DJ Troup, he released a single 12-inch on Fresh Records in 1988: “Just Rhymin'” b/w “Get Retarded.” The nimble B-side would become a fave among rap fans and was interpolated by Dr. Dre and LL Cool J for the single “Zoom.” Mack eventually met Diddy – who was at that time looking to set up Bad Boy after being fired from Uptown Records – outside the club Mecca in Manhattan. Mack freestyled for Diddy and earned a record contract.  After breaking through with “Flava in Ya Ear” and its accompanying gold-certified album Project: Funk Da World, Mack struggled to replicate his initial success. He left Bad Boy Records and released Operation: Get Down in 1997 but did not score a hit from the album. Mack later appeared in the video for Diddy’s hit “I Need a Girl Part 1,” but his solo career never regained momentum.  Mack eventually became a minister in South Carolina and appeared to renounce his former life as a rapper in a 2012 video. The video, taken at the Overcomer Ministry commune in Walterboro, S.C., shows the group’s pastor Ralph Gordon Stair talking to Mack. “Craig Mack is dead,” Stair tells the congregation. “We have somebody that used to be Craig Mack.”  In Can’t Stop, Won’t Stop: The Bad Boy Story, the 2017 documentary chronicling the rise of Combs’ revered label and reunion tour, Mack can be heard discussing the possibility of returning to the stage, but declined because of his religious beliefs.  “I don’t think anybody was disappointed,” Combs told Billboard last year. “We kind of respected his wishes. In this game, man, people don’t realize the music industry only has a one percent rate ratio, so sometimes it’s very stressful and it brings you only to places that you can go to and should go to, which is God. We can respect that because if any of us is still here, we’d have to go to him, too. Sometimes, people can’t walk back and forth in both wor"

gossipcop-1551062653,"  George Clooney and his wife, Amal, attend the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. (Alberto Pizzoli/AFP via Getty Images)  Once the ultimate bachelor — and two-time People’s Sexiest Man Alive cover model — George Clooney entered entirely new territory this week.  The Oscar-winning actor and his human-rights-lawyer wife of two years, Amal, announced Tuesday that they are the proud new parents of twins, Ella and Alexander.  Clooney has donned many hats in his life — actor, director, producer and activist, but fatherhood had always seemed far away. Was it the early-onset-salt-and-pepper hair? The coterie of models who found themselves on his arm for fleeting moments over the years? The insistence by tabloids and fellow co-stars that it was time for him to settle down? Maybe. Or perhaps it was the simple fact that Clooney himself said again and again that he would not reproduce. In several interviews. Many, many times. For many, many years.  A first-time father at 56, Clooney was often asked throughout his career whether the single life was his ultimate future. But after proposing marriage to Amal in April 2014 and marrying her that September (as well as sharing wedding photos with People magazine in the United States and Hello magazine in Britain), it seemed as if anything was possible for the man who once said, “I don’t see myself ever having kids.”  But it was a long road to get there. “I don’t have that gene that people have to replicate,” he told People in 2006.  When Esquire asked him why he wasn’t married with kids, he replied, “I haven’t had aspirations in that way, ever.” And as for people who thought it was weird that a man in his 50s was single and childless? “What do you do? Should I go, ‘I got to get me some kids right now!’ and rush out and impregnate someone?”  Clooney seemed to express frustration when asked how he could ever relate to the fathers he occasionally portrays onscreen. His answer: “Well, I’m also not running for president, but I played that role in ‘Ides of March.’ I wasn’t an actual lawyer when I did ‘Michael Clayton,’ and I don’t fire people for a living like I did in ‘Up in the Air.’ ”  “I keep saying I’ll never get married again or have children but people just don’t want to believe me,” Clooney told Britain’s Daily Express just three months before popping the question to his now-wife.  Of course, celebrities are people, too, and it shouldn’t surprise anyone that a man might change his mind around the midcentury mark. And Clooney is certainly not alone in choosing to wait till later in life to welcome a child into the family: Comedian Steve Martin became a father at age 67 in 2012; Elton John was 63 when he had a baby via a surrogate in 2010; and Chris Noth was 53 when he welcomed his only child in 2008.  Perhaps it’s the fact that Clooney always seemed so delightfully and devilishly Clooney-ish that made his bachelordom seem like the only constant in our ever-changing popular culture. But we can rest easy knowing that despite some hesitation about having a family over the years, his sense of humor has remained steady throughout.  “Ella, Alexander and Amal are all healthy, happy and doing fine,” the statement announcing the birth of the twins read. “George is sedated and should recover in a few days.”",1,en,"  George Clooney and his wife, Amal, attend the 2016 Cannes Film Festival.

He and his wife, Amal, who is a human-rights lawyer, proudly announced on Tuesday that they have become parents to twins, Ella and Alexander. Up until now, fatherhood seemed unlikely for Clooney, given his reputation as a bachelor and his previous statements about not wanting to have children. In several interviews over the years, he expressed his lack of desire to reproduce. Despite this, at the age of 56, Clooney surprised many by marrying Amal in 2014 and sharing wedding photos with People magazine and Hello magazine. While he had never envisioned himself settling down with a family, he eventually changed his tune. Clooney often faced questions about his single status and the absence of children throughout his career. However, he brushed off these inquiries and expressed his lack of interest in marriage and children. In 2006, he told People magazine that he did not have the desire to replicate. When asked why he wasn't married with kids by Esquire, he simply stated that he never aspired to have them. He also sarcastically responded to those who found it strange that he was single and childless in his 50s. Despite his initial reservations, Clooney later proposed to Amal and got married. However, his journey to embracing fatherhood was not without its challenges. Three months prior to his marriage, he expressed his skepticism about getting married or having children in an interview with Britain's Daily Express. Nevertheless, it is not uncommon for people to change their minds later in life, and Clooney is no exception. Many celebrities, like Steve Martin, Elton John, and Chris Noth, have also chosen to become parents later in life. Clooney's charming and playful persona may have contributed to the perception that he would remain a bachelor forever, but his recent decision to start a family proves otherwise. Despite his initial hesitations, Clooney's sense of humor has remained intact throughout this journey. The statement announcing the birth of his twins noted that Ella, Alexander, and Amal are all in good health and that George is recovering after being sedated."

Jokingly promoting their new boy band, dubbed “James Street,” group members Nick Carter, Howie Dorough, AJ McLean, Kevin Richardson and Brian Littrell performed an mock version of their 1999 single, “Larger Than Life,” changing it to “Late Late-r Than Life” to reflect Corden’s 12:37 p.m. broadcast.  Prior to their sketch, the band teased their appearance with their mock album cover with Corden on Twitter, where they created the hashtag ""#Jamesstreet.""  In the performance, the late-night host and singers donned their signature white attire, recognizable from their 1999 album, Millennium, which featured the “Larger Than Life” single.  The sketch opened with Corden explaining that he plans to take over for one of the Backstreet Boys at their performance later that night.

The Backstreet Boys might have found a new member in James Corden — or so he hopes — as the late-night host performed alongside the boy band for a revamped version of their hit single during Tuesday night’s Late Late Show.  Jokingly promoting their new boy band, dubbed “James Street,” group members Nick Carter, Howie Dorough, AJ McLean, Kevin Richardson and Brian Littrell performed an mock version of their 1999 single, “Larger Than Life,” changing it to “Late Late-r Than Life” to reflect Corden’s 12:37 p.m. broadcast.  Prior to their sketch, the band teased their appearance with their mock album cover with Corden on Twitter, where they created the hashtag ""#Jamesstreet.""  In the performance, the late-night host and singers donned their signature white attire, recognizable from their 1999 album, Millennium, which featured the “Larger Than Life” single.  The sketch opened with Corden explaining that he plans to take over for one of the Backstreet Boys at their performance later that night.

gossipcop-860217,"A CONTROVERSIAL reality TV star has courted controversy after admitting that she used drugs while pregnant with her daughter less than a year after admitting she nearly died of a heroin overdose.  Jenelle Evans’ past has been notoriously sketchy but the MTV Teen Mom 2 star says that despite the fact she has gotten her life back on track and that she’s “not a bad kid any more”, online speculation over her parenting methods is forcing Child Protection Services on her.  It comes after fans accused the star of child abuse after her son, Kaiser, begged for food on the TV show. The shocking footage sparked a Twitter backlash with the hashtag #SaveKaiser and cost the mother-of-three her job as an ambassador with Blue Apron.  In her memoir, Read Between the Lines: From the Diary of a Teenage Mom, Ms Evans admitted that at the peak of her drug addiction she was using heroin “four or five times a day”.  “I was hooked,” she said of her abusive relationship, which saw her arrested for possession of marijuana and heroin, according to Radar.  This week, Ms Evans appeared on The Brand podcast and admitted that while she was pregnant with daughter Ensley, she tested positive for THC, the principal psychoactive found in cannabis.  “I’m not going to lie about that. I tested positive for THC,” the reality star, 26, said.  Daughter Ensley did not test positive.  Ms Evans said the chemical compound was found shortly after she had given birth to her daughter just over one year ago after Child Protective Services asked her if she had smoked during her pregnancy.  “I said, ‘I did within the past 30 days,’” she explained.  “I said, ‘I have really bad esophageal spasms and I throw up every five minutes. I can’t eat.’ And they said, ‘OK, some mums do that. We are not here to judge. We are writing down your information.’”  She said that when Child Protective Services arrived for the wellness check, they closed the case soon after.  But then Ms Evans blamed online speculation over her parenting for at least 30 more visits from Child Protection, calling out “haters online saying that I abuse my kids”.  Despite promising she’s not using, viewers on the hit reality show, on which Ms Evans has appeared since 2011, aren’t so sure.  All jokes aside, someone should go to the land and make sure that those kids (more so Kaiser) are in a safe situation.

Or I’d be losing a lot of weight,” Ms Evans said.  But the young mum, who already has two children, sons Jace, 8, and Kaiser, 3 has a sketchy history with drug abuse, including a near-fatal heroin overdose in 2012.  “I was afraid to speak out and tell people that I was on drugs,” she told Us Weekly last year,  “I basically blacked out and woke up not remembering anything.  “I really was so close to dying.”  After her overdose Ms Evans described how she withdrew from the drug, describing it as “worst flu I’ve ever had for seven days”.  But by that stage the drug had already taken its toll; she had lost custody of son Jace and was “disowned” by family and friends.  “It hurt my heart, made me sick to my soul that I couldn’t see my son. I filled that hateful void with more drugs,” she wrote in her memoir.  “The drugs always made the pain go away. They didn’t turn on me or betray me. I guess heroin was my first steady, dependable lover. It gave me what I needed to live and I gave it my life.

According to The Sun, Stone has been making multiple trips to London to see Garfield perform in his play Angels in America. She’s watched the show several times and allegedly “always” goes back for a backstage visit. “They have even been sneaking out of the back door holding hands,” a source close to Garfield told the outlet.  While Emma spent some time in the UK earlier this year shooting her new film The Favourite, a further trip to London paved the way for them to reconnect. “Andrew’s feelings for Emma never softened and now they are growing close once again,” the source said.  Emma, 28, and Andrew, 34, enjoyed an on again off again romance for four years. In the early 2010’s, these two were Hollywood’s sweethearts after meeting during screentest for The Amazing Spider-Man. The couple went public in 2011, via the classy and showbiz means of a joint appearance during her Saturday Night Live monologue. Everything is love and smiles until rumors aired that the pair was taking a break from their relationship in early 2015. They finally announced their so-called definitive separation later that year.  Yet, here we are, cheering for Emma and Andrew once again.  “The familiarity they have with each other seems to bring them back to a place to try again and again. So, I wouldn’t say that they are back to being an official couple just yet, but the future is probably going to be something where they are together.

And both Emma and Andrew have said in numerous occasions that even after their split, they still love each other very much.  Well, it seems like those weren’t just empty words.  According to The Sun, Stone has been making multiple trips to London to see Garfield perform in his play Angels in America. She’s watched the show several times and allegedly “always” goes back for a backstage visit. “They have even been sneaking out of the back door holding hands,” a source close to Garfield told the outlet.  While Emma spent some time in the UK earlier this year shooting her new film The Favourite, a further trip to London paved the way for them to reconnect. “Andrew’s feelings for Emma never softened and now they are growing close once again,” the source said.  Emma, 28, and Andrew, 34, enjoyed an on again off again romance for four years. In the early 2010’s, these two were Hollywood’s sweethearts after meeting during screentest for The Amazing Spider-Man. The couple went public in 2011, via the classy and showbiz means of a joint appearance during her Saturday Night Live monologue. Everything is love and smiles until rumors aired that the pair was taking a break from their relationship in early 2015. They finally announced their so-called definitive separation later that year.  Yet, here we are, cheering for Emma and Andrew once again.  “The familiarity they have with each other seems to bring them back to a place to try again and again. So, I wouldn’t say that they are back to being an official couple just yet, but the future is probably going to be something where they are together. It is basically just a matter of time,” the source said.  We choose to remain optimistic!"

The actor appears on the September cover of GQ where he explained why he chooses to stay very quiet when it comes to his private life.  “I always think the risk reward is very much weighted in the wrong direction,” Pattinson, 31, said of opening up in interviews. “If I could stay silent, I would.”  Pattinson has been dating singer F.K.A. Twigs since 2014, and recently told Howard Stern they were “kind of” engaged. But when asked by GQ if he was getting married, the actor — who revealed he calls his girlfriend Twigs — responded with a noncommittal “eh.”  Daniel Jackson/GQ  Pattinson said that he went to therapy a few years ago – and his therapist commented that he was good at “talking without saying anything.” He said he uses that skill in all his interviews. The Good Time actor explained that he chooses to stay private so people don’t form ideas about his personality that may later change and label him as dishonest.  RELATED: Celeb Quotes of the Day: Jennifer Lawrence, Emma Stone & More  “I want to be misunderstood,” he told the magazine after declining to talk about anything personal. “People are always changing, and the more you put something down in print, people form opinions and they’re constantly creating who they think you are. If you do something that contradicts that, or if you do something which goes out of that box, then you can look like a liar or something like that.”  FROM PEN: Chrissy Metz on ‘This Is Us’, Crying on Set, and Her Body Positivity  The actor also revealed the great lengths he’d go to during the height of the Twilight whirlwind to a little privacy. He recalled how he would have different cars parked around Los Angeles with a full change of clothes. If he noticed he was being followed by paparazzi, he would pop into the garages, change, and leave in a different car.  He would also try to confuse photographers by having all of his friends order different rides out of restaurants when they were together and sending the cars to different places after trading outfits with one of his friends. Pattinson also recalled riding in trunks several times to hide from the photographers – and once drove around all night when one was tailing him to find out where his new house is.  “There are ways to disappear, like, fairly easily,” he said. “It just involves effort, and most people can’t be bothered to put the effort in.”  Good Time hits theaters August 11.",1,en,"After years of overexposure thanks to his star-making turn in Twilight, Robert Pattinson values his privacy.

UPDATE (1/9/18): Tessa Thompson has clarified her statements regarded Time’s Up and Lena Dunham in a Twitter post.  EARLIER: Tessa Thompson is among the many women taking part in the Time’s Up initiative, which made its presence felt at last night’s Golden Globes ceremony. In an Instagram comment, the star of “Thor: Ragnarok” said planning for the red carpet the day before the event required “6 hours, 60 artists, 8 activists and a lot of coffee.” And one of those people, Thompson said, was not Lena Dunham.  In the celebratory photo Thompson posted yesterday are Michelle Williams, Billie Jean King, Rashida Jones, Susan Sarandon, Laura Dern — and, on the end of the middle row, far right, is Dunham. The “Girls” creator and star has lain low of late; the last Tweet she wrote was an apology for casting doubt on Aurora Perrineau’s rape accusation. And, according to Thompson, her participation in Time’s Up planning was limited to the photo op: “Lena was not anywhere present in our group during the countless hours of work for the last two months.”  Thompson’s statement, which came in response to several commenters questioning why Dunham was in the picture at all, reads in full:  “Lena was not anywhere present in our group during the countless hours of work for the last two months. We hosted an open house for actresses for red carpet messaging and Lena presence was a surprise to us all. This is a time of reckoning. And for many, a re-education. So many women also have real work to do. I’m afraid it’s too nuanced a conversation to have on this platform. But I hear you, and know that your thoughts and words are not lost on me.

gossipcop-7658353025,"“A Star Is Born” is that thing we always yearn for but so rarely get to see: a transcendent Hollywood movie. It’s the fourth remake of a story that dates back to 1932, but this one has a look and vibe all its own — rapturous and swooning, but also delicate and intimate and luminous. It’s set in the present day, but in spirit it’s a sophisticated retro ’70s drama built around the uncanny flow of feeling that develops between the movie’s two stars: Bradley Cooper, who plays Jackson Maine, a hard-drinking, bad-ol’-boy redneck rock ‘n’ roller who is still hanging on as a popular attraction but has lost the lust for what he’s doing, and Lady Gaga, in her fetching and accomplished movie-star debut, as Ally, an ingenuous, fresh-faced singer-songwriter who becomes his lover and stage partner before rocketing on her own into the new pop stratosphere. She takes off as he slowly crashes — that’s the soapy tragic “Star Is Born” concept. But what the movie does is to take this fabled melodramatic romantic seesaw and turn it into something indelibly heartfelt and revealing. Cooper directed the movie himself, working from a script he co-wrote with Eric Roth and Will Fetters, and to say that he does a good job would be to understate his accomplishment. As a filmmaker, Bradley Cooper gets right onto the high wire, staging scenes that take their time and play out with a shaggy intimacy that’s shorn of the usual “beats.” The new “Star Is Born” is a total emotional knockout, but it’s also a movie that gets you to believe, at every step, in the complicated rapture of the story it’s telling. More Reviews Venice Film review: 'Isis, Tomorrow. The Lost Souls of Mosul' Telluride Film Review: 'They'll Love Me When I'm Dead' The 1976 version, starring Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson, had some terrific cornball love songs, but they didn’t belong anywhere near the stadium-rock stage, and neither did Streisand, which is part of why the movie came off as borderline ludicrous. It seemed stranded, with a kind of campy sincere ineptitude, between three worlds: Old Hollywood, New Hollywood, and Barbra Streisand rock-princess fantasy. But from the electrifying opening moments of the new version, in which Jackson, boozy and raw, with his sunburned squint and hard-bitten shit-kicker sexiness, takes the stage of a gigantic stadium and launches into a grinding slow rocker that sounds like “Victim of Love”-era Eagles as done by the Allman Brothers, the movie is thrillingly authentic. That’s no minor accomplishment. Hollywood almost never succeeds in nailing the rock world, but “A Star Is Born,” though a love story through and through, is the most lived-in rock ‘n’ roll movie since “Almost Famous.” And that absolute looks right, sounds right, feels right verisimilitude sets the stage for everything that follows. Jackson, who looks to be in his mid-40s, has been around long enough that he now occupies a grey zone between legend and nostalgia. He can still fill an arena full of screaming fans, and his old hits have become classic-rock chestnuts, but his sound and persona have long slipped out of the zeitgeist. His whole outlaw look — the beard and rancher’s hat, the Kristofferson-meets-Skynyrd soused macho twinkle — mark him as a charismatic relic, and the grand irony is this: What that look, and sound, are all about is an era when rock ‘n’ roll strutted its “authenticity,” but now that he’s out of date, Jackson’s authenticity looks more than ever like a showbiz conceit, frozen in amber. It’s a part he’s playing, an image he’s working — and secretly struggling — to keep alive. He’s got a signature ballad that goes “Maybe it’s time to let the old ways die,” and when he wrote it (long ago), he probably didn’t know that he was talking about himself.

In the first of many telling jump cuts, the film leaps from his on-stage glory to Jackson slinking into the back of his car, weary and alone, grabbing the bottle of gin he’s got stashed there. He takes a guzzle, and Cooper, acting with his body, lets you feel just how much Jackson (between sickly coughs) needs the lifeblood of that drink. It’s what he believes in more than the show he’s just finished. How do you play a drunk? We know, of course, that the answer is not to “play drunk,” but Cooper doesn’t just avoid the usual slurry shambling (though at key moments he does a little of that too, and it’s powerful). He brings off something I’ve rarely seen done this exquisitely: He plays blitzed, very functional and in his element, his smile and reflexes greased by the liquor. Jackson speaks in a deep, low, deliberate Southern-stud growl — a voice with real music in it, though one that lets you taste all the booze it’s marinated in. Needing another drink, he has his driver drop him off at the first available bar, which turns out to be a roadside dive on drag-queen karaoke night. It’s not his scene, but he doesn’t mind. He’s the same celebrity everywhere he goes, so he’s in the perfect mood of lit-up contentment when she walks on stage. She is Ally, the one non-drag performer of the night (she’s friends with all the queens there, so they let her sing for real). When she enters the room, the movie pulls off a neat trick. We’ve already seen Ally break up with her boyfriend over the phone, letting out a banshee wail in the process, and when she appears in heavy white-make up and pasted on half-circle eyebrows, her hair teased into a punked-out French pastry, then does a strutting-down-the-bar version of “La Vie en Rose” that she milks for every flourish of theatrical kitsch she can, we think, “Of course! How Gaga-netic!” Backstage after the show, Jackson gently pulls off one of Ally’s eyebrows and asks her out for a drink. But when she emerges from the dressing room","The film ""A Star Is Born"" is a rare and exceptional Hollywood movie that captures the audience's attention. It stands out as the fourth remake of a story that dates back to 1932, yet it possesses its own unique style and atmosphere. The film takes place in modern times but has a retro '70s vibe, creating a sophisticated and captivating drama. The story revolves around the captivating connection between the two main characters: Jackson Maine, a well-known rock 'n' roll artist struggling with personal demons, played by Bradley Cooper, and Ally, a talented singer-songwriter who becomes his lover and rises to fame on her own, portrayed by Lady Gaga. As she flourishes, he falters, following the classic tragic ""Star Is Born"" concept. However, what sets this movie apart is its ability to delve deep into the emotions of the characters, presenting a heartfelt and revealing narrative. Bradley Cooper, who directed the film and co-wrote the script with Eric Roth and Will Fetters, has done an exceptional job. He fearlessly takes risks by creating scenes that unfold naturally and intimately, without adhering to the usual conventions. ""A Star Is Born"" is not only emotionally captivating but also skillfully convinces the audience to embrace and believe in the complex story it tells. In contrast, the previous 1976 version featuring Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson failed to truly capture the essence of the rock world. The love songs in that version felt out of place on the stadium-rock stage, and Streisand herself seemed misplaced, leaving the film feeling campy and awkward. However, the new ""A Star Is Born"" immediately establishes its authenticity and credibility from the very first moments. Jackson, with his rugged appearance and edgy charisma, takes the stage of a massive stadium and delivers a mesmerizing performance that perfectly embodies the rock 'n' roll spirit of the era. The movie effortlessly achieves a sense of truthfulness in its depiction of the music genre, something that is rarely accomplished by Hollywood. Jackson, in his mid-40s, finds himself situated between legendary status and being outdated. Although he still draws large crowds and his old songs have become classics, his sound and image have faded from the mainstream. The irony lies in the fact that his signature look and sound, which once projected authenticity, now appear as showbiz clichés frozen in time. It is a role he continues to play, attempting to preserve his image, all while secretly struggling to keep up. Jackson has a renowned ballad that questions the need to hold on to the past, and it's almost as if he unknowingly foretold his own destiny when he wrote it. In a significant moment, the film transitions from his on-stage success to a vulnerable and exhausted Jackson alone in his car, reaching for his bottle of gin. Cooper masterfully portrays the desperation Jackson feels for his drink, embodying the character's state without resorting to exaggerated drunkenness. He depicts a functioning and charming drunk, his smile and reflexes enhanced by alcohol. Jackson's deep, deliberate Southern accent, infused with the remnants of his alcohol consumption, adds even more dimension to his character. Craving another drink, he instructs his driver to take him to the nearest bar, which happens to be a roadside dive hosting drag-queen karaoke night. Despite the unusual setting, Jackson doesn't mind, as he is always recognized wherever he goes. In this state of contentment, he watches as Ally, the only non-drag performer of the night, takes the stage. With her unique appearance, adorned in heavy makeup, exaggerated eyebrows, and extravagant hair, she captivates the audience with her rendition of ""La Vie en Rose."" Backstage, Jackson removes one of Ally's eyebrows and invites her for a drink, marking the beginning of their relationship."

We’re just starting the search for a director… we have to cast it.

And only one thing is for sure: from the horrifying secrets of Westeros’ history to the true origin of the white walkers, the mysteries of the East to the Starks of legend… it’s not the story we think we know.”  In addition to writing the pilot, Goldman (X-Men: First Class) will serve as showrunner, and will join Game of Thrones author George R.R.

The documentary, directed by Kevin Macdonald, suggests that Houston was allegedly sexually abused as a child by Dee Dee Warwick, Houston’s cousin and the sister of soul singer Dionne Warwick.  The news comes near the end of the film, when Houston’s former longtime assistant, Mary Jones, alleges that Houston told her that she was molested as a young child by her cousin Dee Dee, the niece of Houston’s mother Cissy Houston.

And now, he’s “in touch with emotions and his true self like never before,” the source says.  Brad Pitt finally opens up about his bitter divorce with Angelina Jolie  And it seems like this self-awareness comes with some great realisations. “He has come to realise that leaving Jen for Angelina was one of the biggest mistakes of his life,” the source adds. “And while he’s not in love with Jen, he realises how much he does love her. Brad keeps telling friends that he’s seeing everything more clearly.”  However, these realisations are obviously far too late. Jennifer has been married to Wanderlust co-star Justin Theroux for two years now.  And while Brad would “never dream of” ruining his ex’s new marriage, he “would take a second chance at love with Jen in a heartbeat.”  If they can’t be romantic partners, though, the War Machine star wants Jen to be his partner in other pursuits, In Touch further reported.

gossipcop-4241884018,"In the past, Kanye’s capriciousness has been repeatedly forgiven and, at times, belatedly rewarded with accolades. It is hard to imagine a My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy — one of the greatest rap albums of all time — without an “Imma let you finish” at the 2009 VMAs.  His new album, ye, doesn’t merit any similar mercy.  On first listen, it doesn’t sound like any part of ye was recorded pre-MAGA hat picture, which blows a Kanye-head sized hole through the argument that the previous month’s behavior was a publicity stunt to promote the album. If anything, the album seems like an meek afterthought to the Twitter tirade and dive into right-wing politics. Most of it deals with the repercussions of the storm which came before it, and for the first time in his career, the artist’s personality is overwhelming the art.  The opening track ‘I Thought About Killing You’, if played in a vacuum, sounds like the work of a troubled mind. If a poem like this came from a loved one, it would surely merit discussion about a trip to the therapist. Kanye goes on to deliver cringe-worthy rhymes on issues ranging from Russell Simmons rape allegations to his petrification on realizing that his daughter might one day look like his wife. He teases a few tidbits of The Old Kanye, chopping up beats from Slick Rick and The Edwin Hawkins Singers samples on ‘No Mistakes’, to keep his fans just interested enough. It’s telling that the one standout track, ‘Ghost Town’ is the track on which Kanye lurks in the background, devoting more time on production than on spoken word, and letting John Legend and Kid Cudi take over.  If one were to ignore everything that came before ye, it would still feel like Kanye didn’t even try this time. The usual meticulousness and perfectionism has apparently been supplanted by a Kanye shrug. The music is haphazard and hollow, mirroring the guy making it. Maybe he’s become blasé and doesn’t want to spend time on music anymore. He did say he wanted to run for President in 2020 (or 2024?) anyway.",1,en,"In the past, Kanye’s capriciousness has been repeatedly forgiven and, at times, belatedly rewarded with accolades.

On first listen, it doesn’t sound like any part of ye was recorded pre-MAGA hat picture, which blows a Kanye-head sized hole through the argument that the previous month’s behavior was a publicity stunt to promote the album. If anything, the album seems like an meek afterthought to the Twitter tirade and dive into right-wing politics. Most of it deals with the repercussions of the storm which came before it, and for the first time in his career, the artist’s personality is overwhelming the art.  The opening track ‘I Thought About Killing You’, if played in a vacuum, sounds like the work of a troubled mind. If a poem like this came from a loved one, it would surely merit discussion about a trip to the therapist. Kanye goes on to deliver cringe-worthy rhymes on issues ranging from Russell Simmons rape allegations to his petrification on realizing that his daughter might one day look like his wife. He teases a few tidbits of The Old Kanye, chopping up beats from Slick Rick and The Edwin Hawkins Singers samples on ‘No Mistakes’, to keep his fans just interested enough. It’s telling that the one standout track, ‘Ghost Town’ is the track on which Kanye lurks in the background, devoting more time on production than on spoken word, and letting John Legend and Kid Cudi take over.  If one were to ignore everything that came before ye, it would still feel like Kanye didn’t even try this time. The usual meticulousness and perfectionism has apparently been supplanted by a Kanye shrug. The music is haphazard and hollow, mirroring the guy making it. Maybe he’s become blasé and doesn’t want to spend time on music anymore. He did say he wanted to run for President in 2020 (or 2024?) anyway.","Kanye's unpredictability has often been forgiven in the past, even earning him praise. For instance, his interruption at the 2009 VMAs is now an iconic moment in the history of rap music, an integral part of his groundbreaking album, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. However, his latest album, ye, does not deserve the same leniency. Upon first listen, it becomes apparent that the entire album lacks any trace of material recorded prior to his controversial MAGA hat photo. This undermines the argument that his recent behavior was a mere publicity stunt to promote the album. Rather, ye seems like an afterthought to his Twitter outbursts and venture into right-wing politics. It mostly deals with the consequences of his previous actions, and for the first time in his career, Kanye's personal identity outweighs the art he creates. The opening track, 'I Thought About Killing You', when listened to independently, reveals a troubled mindset. If such a poem came from someone we care about, it would undoubtedly merit a discussion about seeking professional help. Kanye proceeds to deliver cringe-worthy verses on sensitive subjects, ranging from Russell Simmons' sexual assault allegations to his apprehensions about his daughter resembling his wife. He offers glimpses of his past brilliance by sampling beats from Slick Rick and The Edwin Hawkins Singers on 'No Mistakes', hoping to maintain some interest from his fans. Interestingly, the standout track, 'Ghost Town', allows Kanye to step back and focus more on production, letting John Legend and Kid Cudi take the spotlight. Even if we disregard everything that preceded ye, it still feels like Kanye didn't put in much effort this time. His usual meticulousness and perfectionism have seemingly been replaced with indifference. The music feels disjointed and lacking substance, mirroring Kanye's current state of being. Perhaps he has grown apathetic and no longer wishes to dedicate time to creating music. After all, he did express his desire to run for President in either 2020 or 2024."

Kim had been asked – again – to discuss his decision to exit the CBS procedural, a topic that has been covered long and often since it happened.  “I’ve known [CBS Entertainment President] Kelly [Kahl] and [CBS SEVP Programming] Thom [Sherman] for a while…I know them, and like them, and am grateful to them for the words they said on their panel the other day.”  “That said, it’s possible to be grateful and respectful, and still maintain a steadfast sense of your self worth,” Kim said, pointedly.  Days earlier at TCA, Kahl and Sherman took multiple questions about the controversial exits of Hawaii Five-0‘s two Asian co-stars, Kim and Grace Park, who sought parity with the show’s leads, Alex O’Loughlin and Scott Caan, and left after not getting equal pay.  “We never like to lose characters audiences love but that happens on long-running series,” Kahl had said that morning. “We made very lucrative offers to those actors,” he added, while declining to name the dollar amount or how it compared to the salaries of series stars O’Loughlin and Caan. Kim and Park, whose roles had been conceived as supporting, had made less from the get-go; sources said they were offered salaries close to, but not equal to, that of the leads.  Saying it was time to “close that chapter…and begin this chapter” of his life, Kim said this morning he “could not be more excited to be back on ABC,” where he had been part of the cast of Lost, which he credited with launching his career. “This is the start of something new.”  And yet, the first question asked during The Good Doctor Q&A was from a critic demanding to know how come he’s not on the CBS series and is now “behind the scenes” on ABC’s doc drama.  “Good morning,” Kim responded calmly, getting a laugh.  “I’m very proud to be part of this show,” said Kim, who is exec producer on The Good Doctor, which he says he first saw several years ago in Korea and brought to ABC.  “It started as a Korean show,” Kim said. “I loved the message of it,” noting also that the doctor drama is a “familiar genre to American audiences.” The Good Doctor centers on Shaun Murphy (Freddie Highmore), a young surgeon with autism and savant syndrome, who leaves a quiet country life to join a prestigious hospital’s surgical unit.  Kim said he brought the format to the U.S., calling it “crucial” to have signed House’s David Shore as EP.  “I am really content being behind the scenes” on the new ABC drama, Kim says, calling it “fascinating” to watch the actors, as a producer.  “At some point I would love to play with them…David and I have talked about it in the past and we’ll see what comes up.’",0,en,0,"Hawaii Five-O “was a really important part of my life for seven years, and I’m grateful to CBS and everyone involved with the show for giving me the opportunity,” Daniel Dae Kim said at TCA this morning during a Q&A for ABC’s new The Good Doctor, on which he is EP.

The Golden Globe outcomes occasionally raise eyebrows, but the awards show is a good indicator of who might take home Oscars statuettes.

gossipcop-864734,"• American walks out of after media questions about Florida crash • Five-times champion beats Elise Mertens 7-6, 6-4 in first round  A tearful Venus Williams walked out of her press conference on Monday after her first-round victory at Wimbledon, the American’s first match since her involvement in a fatal car accident in Florida that police allege she caused.  The No10 seed deflected a series of queries about the wrongful-death lawsuit filed on Thursday before she became overcome with emotion, prompting the moderator to request that journalists refrained from asking about the incident.  Venus Williams ‘at fault’ in fatal car crash, say Florida police Read more  “There are really no words to describe, like, how devastating and – yeah. I’m completely speechless. It’s just – yeah, I mean, I’m just …” a visibly shaken Williams said, her voice trailing off.  The seven-times major champion then broke down in tears, stepping out into the hallway to gather herself with members of her team.  Williams returned after about five minutes to field five more questions, mostly related to her 7-6 (7), 6-4 win against Belgium’s Elise Mertens amid wildly fluctuating weather on No1 Court, as the sun‑splashed afternoon gave way to blustery conditions and ultimately rain.  The American – at 37 the oldest woman in the draw here – was at her imperious best in the opening stages, breaking Mertens in her opening service game and dictating points with her serve. But Mertens, who was not born when Williams turned professional and only four when she won the first of her five Wimbledon singles titles, overcame those initial nerves and began challenging Williams with powerful groundstrokes into the corners and well-concealed variety.  Mertens blinked during the first-set tiebreak, then surrendered her early service break in the second. Rain interrupted play with the 21-year-old, who had just saved her second match point with a gorgeous backhand lob, serving at 3-5, 40-40 in the second set.  After a 33-minute delay Williams finished the job, uncorking an overhead smash to see off Mertens after an hour and 40 minutes and booking a second-round match against China’s Qiang Wang.  The American flashed her familiar smile after meeting her opponent at the net but it became clear during the press conference that her 20th appearance at the tournament she has won five times will be loaded with emotion.  “You can’t prepare for everything,” Williams said. “I have no idea what tomorrow will bring. That’s all I can say about it. That’s what I’ve learned.”  Palm Beach Gardens police said witnesses told investigators that Williams ran a red light in her Toyota Sequoia SUV at around 1pm on 9 June, injuring 79-year-old Jerome Barson, who died 13 days later. Barson was riding in the passenger seat when the Hyundai Accent driven by his wife, Linda, crashed into the side of Williams’s vehicle.  Williams told investigators she entered the six-lane intersection on a green light but was forced to stop midway through because of traffic ahead of her, failing to see the Barsons’ car when she continued through at about 5mph.  But police concluded the driver of Williams’s car “is at fault for violating the right of way”. Linda Barson, 68, also sustained injuries, including “a cracked sternum, shattered right arm, broken wrist, hand and fingers”.  Williams made her first public comments on the incident in a Facebook post on Friday night, describing herself as “heartbroken”.  One of only two former Wimbledon champions in the women’s field, Williams has a promising draw and perhaps a renewed ambition after her inspired run to the Australian Open final in January – a remarkable feat given the incurable autoimmune disease that has hamstrung her game for most of the decade.",0,en,0,"• American walks out of after media questions about Florida crash • Five-times champion beats Elise Mertens 7-6, 6-4 in first round  A tearful Venus Williams walked out of her press conference on Monday after her first-round victory at Wimbledon, the American’s first match since her involvement in a fatal car accident in Florida that police allege she caused.

Introduced by The Chainsmokers, BTS made their U.S. television debut at the 2017 American Music Awards on Sunday, November 19th. BTS is taking the U.S over a landslide by being the first Korean Pop Boy Band to perform on a major American awards show.  BTS delivered their latest hit “DNA” with flashy choreography and enormous support from their A.R.M.Y. (a name given to their international fanbase) who accompanied them with chants throughout their performance. Tweets during and after their epic performance took over social media with the hashtag #BTSxAMAs. Fans, attendees and those new to the K-pop boy band fanbase obsessed over their amazing dance moves, voice control, red carpet fashion and physical aspect of the members of the boy band.  BTS (currently standing for ‘Behind the Scenes’) is a seven-member South Korean Pop Band formed by Big Hit Entertainment. While most boy bands in the U.S. have from three to five members in their groups, South Korean bands are internationally known for having more than 10 members in the band.  Jin, J-Hope, RM (known as Rap Monster), Suga, Jimin, V and Jungkook are taking over the world as BTS with their latest album “Love Yourself: Her” which has helped them become the highest charting K-pop group on the Billboard Hot 100.  Their performance at the 2017 AMA’s was highly anticipated by fans of the band when they announced it on social media. ’To call this guys International superstars honestly seems like an understatement’ said Drew Taggart from The Chainsmokers before the boys bounded on stage  During their performance, fans were not the only ones freaking out. Almost everyone, including celebrity guests like Ansel Elgort, was on their feet cheering and singing along with the band. Ansel even appeared to be recording the performance on his phone. “I need a moment to recover from that performance. That was incredible” said Jared Leto who joined the BTS mania and who was also left speechless after BTS’s performance.  It is safe to say that BTS has officially introduced K-pop to the U.S with their mind-blowing AMA’s performance which has left fans and those new to the concept of K-Pop wishing for more. Luckily this will not be the last time we see BTS on our television sets since shows like Jimmy Kimmel and Ellen DeGeneres have already booked BTS for a special performance on their shows which you won’t want to miss.",0,en,0,"Viewers of the 2017 American Music Awards witnessed history.

Fans, attendees and those new to the K-pop boy band fanbase obsessed over their amazing dance moves, voice control, red carpet fashion and physical aspect of the members of the boy band.  BTS (currently standing for ‘Behind the Scenes’) is a seven-member South Korean Pop Band formed by Big Hit Entertainment. While most boy bands in the U.S. have from three to five members in their groups, South Korean bands are internationally known for having more than 10 members in the band.  Jin, J-Hope, RM (known as Rap Monster), Suga, Jimin, V and Jungkook are taking over the world as BTS with their latest album “Love Yourself: Her” which has helped them become the highest charting K-pop group on the Billboard Hot 100.  Their performance at the 2017 AMA’s was highly anticipated by fans of the band when they announced it on social media. ’To call this guys International superstars honestly seems like an understatement’ said Drew Taggart from The Chainsmokers before the boys bounded on stage  During their performance, fans were not the only ones freaking out. Almost everyone, including celebrity guests like Ansel Elgort, was on their feet cheering and singing along with the band. Ansel even appeared to be recording the performance on his phone. “I need a moment to recover from that performance. That was incredible” said Jared Leto who joined the BTS mania and who was also left speechless after BTS’s performance.  It is safe to say that BTS has officially introduced K-pop to the U.S with their mind-blowing AMA’s performance which has left fans and those new to the concept of K-Pop wishing for more. Luckily this will not be the last time we see BTS on our television sets since shows like Jimmy Kimmel and Ellen DeGeneres have already booked BTS for a special performance on their shows which you won’t want to miss."
gossipcop-1716370499,"Dakota Johnson; most of us know her as the actress from Fifty Shades of Grey. While we may have seen Johnson in some pretty intimate positions on-screen, there’s definitely a lot we don’t know about the Fifty Shades star. Like, for instance, the superfluity of familiar names in her family tree. Seeing that her popular movie, Fifty Shades Darker came out on the day of love—Valentine's Day—it's only fitting to dedicate a piece to the actress who brought us the sexy and quaint, Anastasia Steele. Johnson, after all, has become somewhat something of a Valentine’s Day staple, herself. Here are 15 facts about Dakota Johnson or, as some might call her, ""that girl from Fifty Shades of Grey."" We guarantee that she will no longer by ""that girl"" by the end of the list! 15 Her Family Tree Is Full Of Famous Faces You know how we said there are a few familiar names in her family tree? Well, we weren’t lying. Her parents are fellow actors, Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson. Unfortunately, her parents divorced in 1994 so Dakota had to split her time between the two. ""It was the only way that I could be with them,"" she said in an interview for Cosmopolitan. ""And since they were divorced, I would spend two weeks with one and two weeks with the other, traveling with a tutor."" But wait, it gets better. Her maternal grandmother (can you guess..) is Hitchcock actress Tippi Hedren. Yes, that’s right, so clearly creative talent lies in that family. We’ve never heard of a family tree with so many famous names! Thanksgiving is probably a whirlwind. Now, Dakota Johnson is another famous name in that tree. 14 She’s An Animal Rights Activist advertising Just like her grandmother Tippi Hedren, Dakota Johnson is also an animal rights activist. Like grandmother, like granddaughter shall we say? As animal lovers ourselves, we’re pleased to hear that she’s following in her grandmother’s footsteps—both in acting and in animal rights. In 2014, Johnson saved 12 horses from being slaughtered by paying for them. What a sweet thing to do! We bet her grandmother was really proud. It’s always so great to hear about celebrities doing positive things - so naturally, we’re happy to hear of Dakota’s compassionate side. We admit we have a soft spot for animal lovers, but who doesn't? We always love hearing about people doing good deeds for animals and it’s always nice to hear celebrities using their celebrity title for the better. 13 She Grew Up Shooting Guns And Riding Horses In Colorado She may play the innocent and naive Anastasia Steele in the Fifty Shades movies, but growing up Johnson was anything but naive. She grew up in Colorado at her dad’s house, where she learned to build a fire, ride a horse, ride motorbikes, and even shoot a gun. And this was all before she was just 10 years old! Sounds like a badass kid to us! But when she wasn’t at her father’s house, she was at her mom’s house in L.A. which she also loved. It's hard to imagine a 10 year old these days shooting guns, riding motorbikes, or building fires without being grounded. But it sounds like she had a pretty inspiring and freeing childhood which makes us fall for the actress all the more. 12 She Never Dates advertising By the header, we mean she never has casual relationships. She only has long-term relationships. Good for her, is all we can say! You hear of so many celebrities who are constantly dating other celebrities. You can barely keep up with who they’re dating these days. It seems to be one guy or girl after another. So it’s great to hear of Dakota’s conservative views on relationships. Apparently she’s only ever been in long-term, serious relationships; she doesn’t just date. That probably explains why she’s been in a relationship with model Matthew Hitt since 2014. Yes, it’s been a kind of an on-and-off relationship but they’ve been in it for the long haul so far. So, to sum up, we like her whole dating attitude. The commitment is great and saves you a lot of time. 11 She HATED School It seems l",1,en,"Dakota Johnson; most of us know her as the actress from Fifty Shades of Grey.

Okay, so maybe not all of you hated school - many of you probably loved school or at least thrived at school. But most of us can say with the utmost certainty that we hated school with a passion. We all have our reasons why. Johnson, for instance, hated school because she felt like an ""alien."" She said she didn’t understand the process of school as a child and felt ""suffocated."" I don't know about you guys, but I can totally relate with Dakota on this. Many of us felt like we didn’t really fit in at school so it’s especially comforting to hear that a big name like Dakota Johnson also felt like a social outcast in class. Like many of us, she preferred hanging out with her friends than going to school. But hey, we admire her honesty. 10 Auditioning Gives Her Panic Attacks advertising Watching the pristine-looking A-list celebrities gliding around the Golden Globes Award ceremony is enough to wreck your mind with self-doubt over their unbelievably high levels of confidence and self esteem. If only we could possess as much poise! The truth is, many of these celebrities don’t feel that way at all; confident and self assured, that is. Dakota Johnson, for example, gets so nervous during auditions that she often has panic attacks. And we’re not just talking a bit of breathlessness here and there, we’re talking full-on panic attacks—the real deal. So before you come to your conclusions that the celebrities you see on television and in magazines are way more confident than you’ll ever be, just remember something: every single one of them suffers from self-doubt at one point or another. It happens to all of","Dakota Johnson, the actress known for her role in Fifty Shades of Grey, has a lot more to her than what meets the eye on screen. Her family tree is full of famous faces, including her parents Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson, and her maternal grandmother, Tippi Hedren. Johnson is not only an actress, but an animal rights activist as well. In 2014, she saved 12 horses from being slaughtered by paying for them. Despite playing the innocent Anastasia Steele in Fifty Shades, Johnson grew up in Colorado where she learned to shoot guns, ride horses, and build fires. When it comes to dating, Johnson prefers long-term relationships over casual ones. She has been in an on-and-off relationship with model Matthew Hitt since 2014. Surprisingly, Johnson admits to hating school because she felt like an ""alien"" and disliked the suffocating feeling of the education system. Auditioning gives her panic attacks, showing that even A-list celebrities have self-doubt and insecurity."

The singer also attended the wedding earlier in Saturday in Windsor.  According to the Daily Mail, John took the stage after Prince Harry, following his speech, asked his guests, “Does anyone here know how to play the piano?” John then sat by the piano and performed four songs, “Your Song,” “Circle of Life,” “I’m Still Standing” and “Tiny Dancer”; the latter song features the lyric “L.A. lady,” a nod to Markle’s acting career.

Meanwhile, Ed Sheeran & Beyoncé's ""Perfect"" leads for a second week and Migos, Nicki Minaj & Cardi B's ""MotorSport"" also zooms to the top 10. Mariah Carey's ""All I Want for Christmas Is You"" hits the Billboard Hot 100's top 10 at last, jingling from No. 11 (its prior peak) to No. 9 on the chart dated Dec. 30. The modern yuletide classic reaches the top 10 for the first time 23 years after its 1994 release. Atop the Hot 100, Ed Sheeran and Beyoncé's ""Perfect"" reigns for a second week. Plus, Migos, Nicki Minaj and Cardi B's ""MotorSport"" accelerates 15-6 for its first week in the top 10 following the premiere of its official video. As we do every Monday, let's run down the top 10 of the Hot 100, which blends all-genre streaming, airplay and sales data. All charts will update on Billboard.com tomorrow (Dec. 19). Let's start with a blizzard of chart stats about Carey's ""Christmas."" Streams, Sales & Plays: First, the numbers that result in ""Christmas"" (on Columbia/Legacy Records and co-written and co-produced by Carey and Walter Afanasieff) hitting the Hot 100's top 10. The song gains by 4 percent to 25.2 million U.S. streams in the week ending Dec. 14, according to Nielsen Music; dips 8 percent to 19,000 downloads sold in the same tracking span; and lifts 28 percent to 34 million in airplay audience in the week ending Dec. 17. Those totals place ""Christmas"" at No. 7 on the Streaming Songs chart, No. 13 on Digital Song Sales and No. 36 on Radio Songs. Notably, streaming is the most prominent driver of the song, accounting for 70 percent of its chart points this week. Carey's 28th Top 10: Carey collects her 28th Hot 100 top 10. ""Christmas"" is her first since ""Obsessed"" reached No. 7 in 2009. She tallied 19 top 10s in the 1990s and eight in the 2000s. (Of those, 18 hit No. 1, the most among soloists; only The Beatles have more, with 20.) Carey ties Stevie Wonder for the fifth-most Hot 100 top 10s in the chart's history (which dates to its Aug. 4, 1958, inception): Most Top 10 Hot 100 Hits 38, Madonna 34, The Beatles 31, Rihanna 29, Michael Jackson 28, Mariah Carey 28, Stevie Wonder 27, Janet Jackson 27, Elton John Top 10s in the '90s, '00s & '10s: Carey joins an elite list of acts with Hot 100 top 10s in the '90s, '00s & '10s. Its previously-inducted members: Christina Aguilera, Dr. Dre, Whitney Houston, Enrique Iglesias, Michael Jackson, JAY-Z, Jennifer Lopez, Madonna, Snoop Dogg, Britney Spears and Usher. Two of those acts boast streaks dating even further back than the '90s: Jackson ('70s-'10s) and Madonna ('80s-'10s). (As for Houston, she charted top 10s in the '80s, '90s and '00s and re-sent her 1992-93 No. 1 ""I Will Always Love You"" to No. 3 in 2012 following her passing that February. All the other acts above sent at least one song to the top 10 for the first time in each decade.) 'Christmas' in the Top 10: Perhaps surprisingly, Carey charts one of the few holiday top 10s in the Hot 100's history. ""The Chipmunk Song"" by The Chipmunks with David Seville led for four weeks beginning Dec. 22, 1958; Dan Fogelberg's ""Same Old Lang Syne"" reached No. 9 in February 1981 (after debuting in December 1980); and New Kids on the Block's ""This One's for the Children"" rose to No. 7 in the 1989-90 holiday season. No other such song reached the top 10 until Kenny G's ""Auld Lang Syne"" (No. 7, Jan. 8, 2000). Between that New Year's Eve anthem and Carey's ""Christmas,"" Justin Bieber came closest to the top 10 with ""Mistletoe,"" which hit No. 11 (Jan. 5, 2011). Carey's hit is, thus, the first Hot 100 top 10 with the word ""Christmas"" in its title. Notably, for several years in the Hot 100's history (1963-72; 1983-85, barring occasional exceptions), holiday songs were not eligible to chart, instead appearing on separate holiday rankings.

The reality star, 67, was spotted wearing a red hat featuring the president’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan while driving around Malibu in a classic Triumph Spitfire sports car.

The hashtag #TakeDownMillieBobbyBrown started last year, according to one Twitter user, when someone claimed in a tweet that the actress refused to take a picture with her unless she removed her hijab.

gossipcop-867532,"With new Bachelorette Becca Kufrin waiting in the wings to find her true love, former Bachelorette Rachel Lindsay is out of the spotlight — that’s probably just how she wants it. She chose Miami-based doctor Bryan Abasolo at the end of her season, and the two walked into the sunset together during the 2017 finale. But, as we know, relationships founded on The Bachelor and The Bachelorette can have, let’s say, short shelf lives. Bachelorette stars Rachel and Bryan still together in 2018?  Rachel took to television in 2017 with the dream of finding a man. And she found two! It came down to Bryan and Wisconsin-based personal trainer Peter Kraus. The finale was tough to watch, as Peter and Rachel seemed like a better match to many fans but Peter wasn’t convinced that he could be engaged after knowing someone for, like, six weeks (imagine that). That didn’t fly with Rachel, and the two had a really emotional breakup, one that Rachel thinks overshadowed the fact that she found longtime love with Bryan.  “I wish you were able to really see more of Bryan. [The breakup with Peter] really did overshadow, I felt, a happy moment for us, like one of the best moments of my life,” Rachel told Us Weekly. “I’ve never been engaged before and neither has Bryan, and I felt like we were more on the defense about our relationship and having to explain more of it than rather it just showing … So I just wish you really got to see Bryan, and I hate that it took away from him.”  And, for the record, Peter and Rachel do not talk. “For me, the reason there was so much emotion [in the finale] was because that was closure for me, that was it,” Rachel told Us Weekly. “And I really haven’t talked to him because I don’t have anything else to say. From what I hear, he’s doing well too.”  Peter is doing well, and you know what? Rachel and Bryan are, too! The pair is still together, living in Dallas (Bryan relocated from Miami) and being just a regular, everyday Bachelor Nation couple. (They also still have Copper, Rachel’s dog, which is very important.)  The number-one question that a Bachelor couple gets after getting engaged on national television is, “When are you getting married?” At least Rachel and Bryan have an answer. As Bryan told ExtraTV, “We haven’t set anything yet. We definitely want to get married this year, and that’s the plan. 2018, it’s gonna happen.” He explained that even though Rachel “isn’t much of a planner,” the nuptials would happen soon, and they may even be on television. “We would definitely be open to a televised wedding. We, right now, we enjoy showing everybody how in love we are... and I think that would be the culmination of our love story, or the beginning of it,” Bryan said. “I think we would definitely enjoy doing it on national television.”  I would also enjoy have a huge wedding paid for by ABC, so why not? In another interview with Us Weekly, Rachel said she needed a few things of the pair’s impending nuptials. “Good music. I’m very big on ‘I want everyone to have a good time and enjoy themselves.’ I know it’s like our day, but it’s about the people we love celebrating our day with us,” she said. “And I really want good flowers. I feel like flowers add character to the wedding, so that’s a must-have. No roses. We’re done. Those days are over.”  No roses is probably a good idea — she could go into muscle memory and just start handing them out. No matter if you were #TeamBryan or #TeamPeter going into Rachel’s finale, there’s no doubt — she and Bryan are still in love, and they don’t care who knows it.",0,en,0,"With new Bachelorette Becca Kufrin waiting in the wings to find her true love, former Bachelorette Rachel Lindsay is out of the spotlight — that’s probably just how she wants it.

gossipcop-884410,"“Vegas is a funny town,” said Jimmy Kimmel during his emotional opening monologue for Jimmy Kimmel Live on Monday night. “It’s easy to forget people live there.”  The late-night host would know: Kimmel is a Vegas native himself, having moved there from Brooklyn when he was 9. So when he launched into his introduction to Monday night’s show, just one day after a shooter, 64-year-old Stephen Paddock of Mesquite, Nevada, opened fire on a crowd of concertgoers outside Las Vegas’s Mandalay Bay Hotel, the news was particularly poignant. James Corden, Trevor Noah , Stephen Colbert , and Seth Meyers all, like Kimmel, devoted their opening monologues to discussing the shooting in Las Vegas.  But Kimmel, who has recently found a calling transforming his show into a political conscience (even though, as he said Monday night, “I want this to be a comedy show. I hate talking about stuff like this”), began tearing up as soon as the cameras started rolling, giving a particularly unfiltered perspective on gun control and the government’s continuing inaction in the face of mass shootings.  “It’s the kind of thing that makes you want to throw up or give up,” he said. “It’s too much to process.” He offered a scathing indictment of both the president, who offered his “warmest condolences” on Twitter while having signed a bill in February that allowed mentally ill individuals easier access to purchasing guns, as well as of the 56 senators who voted against closing a loophole that allows prospective gun buyers to evade the government-mandated background checks, showing their faces on screen and describing them as those “who won’t do anything about this because the NRA has their balls in a money clip.” For in the wake of various incidents of gun violence—Sandy Hook, Charleston, Orlando, now Las Vegas—the National Rifle Association has successfully lobbied in favor of second-amendment rights: “Our forefathers wanted us to have AK-47s, is the argument,” Kimmel said, incredulous.  Politicians’ inaction—and their widespread reluctance to turn mass shootings into mobilizing efforts in favor of stricter gun control—was the subject of the monologues of Kimmel’s peers, too. As Corden, whose voice also tightened as he delivered a quiet, measured speech, said, “Some say it’s too early to talk about gun control; for those victims last night, it’s far too late.” He, like Noah, is a recent New York transplant who has witnessed the two worst mass shootings since the mid-20th century in the past two years: First, at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida last summer; and now, in Las Vegas, Nevada.  “It should be hard for everyone to fathom,” Corden said. “Gun violence should not be a staple of American life.”  And yet the response to these shootings—of which there have been 275 so far in 2017—has become rote. “People are becoming more accustomed to this kind of news. I almost know how it’s going to play out,” Noah said during The Daily Show on Monday night, a sentiment Meyers echoed opening Late Night With Seth Meyers . “We’re shocked, we’re sad, thoughts and prayers, and then, almost on cue, people are going to come out and say, whatever you do, when you speak about the shooting, don’t talk about guns,” Meyers said.  It’s not just that politicians have refused to pass gun control legislation that, as Stephen Colbert pointed out, “the vast majority of Americans want.” Later this week, a bill that would make it easier for individuals to purchase gun silencers—which, as Politico reported, currently have more stringent requirements for purchase than guns themselves —was expected to go up for a vote in the House of Representatives. However, Sunday night’s shooting is expected to delay the bill to some degree—for, at least, if elected leaders refuse to “politicize” an incident of gun violence as a way of promoting gun control, the converse is also true, that they will also be reluctant to promote gun (and gun accessory) access.

Her portrayal as a drug addict in ""The Town"" showcases the clash of Boston accents reminiscent of ""Bride Wars"". Similarly, her performance in ""The Age of Adaline"" as a perpetually youthful woman feels peculiar, like witnessing a mermaid ride a bicycle. She makes an effort, but her acting has not yet reached the level of her artificially created beauty. Unfortunately, there may not be an algorithmic solution for that. Consequently, I was not particularly excited about the idea of seeing her tremble on a buoy, stitch her own wounds, communicate with animals, or portray a Nancy. While it is refreshing to observe her on a surfboard, this freshness also provides some perspective. While certain actors make sense on the big screen, others might be better suited for a product label, such as beer, beans, or even air. I can hear those who doubt Hudson's talent. All I can say is that the heart desires what it desires. I would actually purchase any product that features Ms. Hudson on its label. There might not be a substantial industrial distinction between what Kate Hudson can do compared to actresses like Blake Lively.

There have been numerous roles that were given to Ms. Lively which seem like suitable fits for Ms. Hudson. Nevertheless, something occurred and suddenly it was someone else's turn to shine. (It is always someone else's turn). And what irritates me about the absence of Kate Hudson in my life and the abundance of roles played by Ms. Lively is the same thing that frustrates me when unnecessary updates are made to a perfectly fine piece of software or when a zealous waiter takes my plate at a restaurant: I was not finished with that."

When model Tati Neves, 26, was asked if she kissed the Baby singer , she coyly answered: ""What do you think, if I was sleeping in the bedroom, just me and him?""  That really clears it up then.  Before the interview on Brazilian TV the model allegedly told friends she saw Bieber smoke weed and spent the night with him.  On Globo TV's Fantastico she was asked if she saw a bevy of girls arrive at 3am the same night, believed to bussed in from a nearby club, she replied: ""No. So, I'd already gone into the bedroom with him.""  She also claimed she had taken the video of Bieber asleep, with his beloved baseball cap nearby, the following morning after waking up first.

The first time that she is mentioned in the novel is during the chapter ""The New Marguerite"", where it is revealed that she could not perform at the ceremony for the former managers. Later in the novel, she is threatened by Erik that if she performs at the Opera House ""a great misfortune will strike"". She shrugs the warning off and performs anyway. When she does, however, croaking noises come out of her mouth and the chandelier comes crashing down. Ashamed, she hides from the public view for a few weeks, before making a return to the opera house.  Carlotta is portrayed by Virginia Pearson in the original 1925 silent film with Lon Chaney. In 1929, new sound scenes were filmed and Mary Fabian was recast as Carlotta, due to the fact that she could sing. Virginia Pearson still appeared in new scenes, now playing Carlotta's mother. These changes are also the same in the 1929 silent, foreign cut of the film (which is most commonly viewed).  In the 1943 film version, she is Mme. Biancarolli who has been drugged by the Phantom and murdered along with her maid when she tries to force him to take off his prop mask.  In Andrew Lloyd Webber's production, Carlotta (last name Giudicelli) is from Italy and is one of the major singing parts. The opera company's prima donna, she despises Christine Daaé and sees the younger woman as a threat to her job and Phantom´s courtesan, when Christine achieves prominence due to the Phantom's dirty tricks. Carlotta and tenor Ubaldo Piangi are lovers; she often turns to him for consolation when things go wrong, and she breaks down crying when his murdered body is discovered onstage. The film reveals that she likes poodles.  In the Lloyd Webber-Joel Schumacher 2004 film version, she was played by Minnie Driver.[1] Due to Driver's lack of experience in opera, her singing voice was dubbed by opera singer Margaret Preece, although she lent her actual voice to the song ""Learn to Be Lonely"" during the end credits.  In Nicholas Meyer's novel The Canary Trainer, the characters of Carlotta and La Sorelli are combined into one, despite being mentioned as separate characters in the original novel.

Middleton had a comfortable upbringing before she became the first commoner to join the royal family after she married William in 2011. But Middleton’s net worth ballooned once she became a duchess.  Here’s everything we know about Middleton’s net worth:  What is Kate Middleton’s net worth?  The 36 year-old mother of three — who gave birth to a second baby boy in April — is worth at least £5 million, or $7 million, according to global wealth-tracking firm Wealth-X, though some estimates put her net worth as high as £7.3 million, or $10 million. Middleton’s wealth is mostly in cash because she doesn’t have a personal portfolio of property or artwork.  That being said, Middleton’s net worth is a lot less than her prince — Wealth-X estimates Prince William’s net worth is at least $30 million, though some reports put his fortune closer to $40 million. According to Wealth-X, $19 million of Prince William’s wealth is in cash. The wealth tracking firm also noted that William has an expensive helicopter fit for a royal — an Augusta A109S Grand helicopter which is valued at $11 million.  Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, Prince George of Cambridge and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge arrive for a children's party for Military families during the Royal Tour of Canada on September 29, 2016 in Victoria, Canada. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  What do we know about Kate Middleton’s money?  Most of Middleton’s net worth stems from Party Pieces, an online party supplies business started by her parents. The company is estimated to be worth around £30 million, or $50 million, thanks in no small part to the exposure it gets from being associated with the royals, according to royal expert Marlene Koenig.  Prior to her life as a full-time duchess, Middleton worked for the family business and was a part-time accessories buyer for a retailer called Jigsaw.  Growing up, Kate and her two siblings, Pippa and James Middleton, attended expensive privates schools from a young age, with years of tuition for just one child estimated to be at least £250,000, or $350,000. Kate met Prince William while in college in Scotland at the prestigious University of St. Andrew’s. She graduated in 2005 with a degree in Art History.  How did Kate Middleton’s net worth change after marrying Prince William?  Joining the royal family meant that Middleton was marrying into an incredible $88 billion fortune amassed over generations.  Before Will and Kate became the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and moved into a 20-room apartment in Kensington Palace, Kate lived in an apartment purchased by her parents in the Chelsea neighborhood of London believed to be worth £1 million, or $1.4 million.

gossipcop-845755,"It’s rare to find me without my curls smoothed, twisted by a curling iron into beach waves , and misted with texture spray. I love to have my hair done. A trip to the local blow-dry bar is my favorite Saturday afternoon pastime. However, at $50 a session, getting this look done by professionals on the regular is costly. So I’ve perfected my own blowout skills. It may seem like an easy task: grab a blow-dryer, point, and blast with heat. But there is a mastery behind it. And you may be making simple mistakes that are actually hurting your hair even more than your look. Here, top pros break down the science to getting a gorgeous at-home blowout every single time and point out all the rookie mistakes that keep them in business. 1. You don’t have a great blow-dryer. Let’s start at the very beginning: Investing in a high-quality tool is important, especially if you have a lot of hair or you’re blow-drying your hair often. “If you have thick hair, you’re probably damaging your hair more with a cheap blow-dryer as opposed to investing in a great one that will protect your hair and blow-dry it quicker,” Kérastase celebrity stylist Jennifer Yepez tells SELF. Expensive dryers tend to come with hair-saving smart features like high power, multiple heat settings, a cool shot, and ionic air technology. The last one helps with frizz, creates shine, and minimizes blow-dry time. “The technology in ionic hair dryers helps break down water molecules faster, which makes the hair dry faster,” she adds. The less time your hair is under heat and the more control you have over the temperature, the healthier it will be. Yepez’s favorites are the new T3 Cura Luxe ($250) and the Dyson Supersonic ($399). Expensive? Yes, but you’ll pay for it in what you save skipping just five to 10 blowouts at the salon—and they’ll last you years. 2. You’re spending too long with your hair wrapped in a towel. “After getting out of the shower, women tend to leave their hair in the towel for like 30 minutes,” says Giovanni Vaccaro, Glasmsquad’s creative director. “A cotton-based towel causes friction on the hair, and it's more prone to damaging the strands to the point where the hair breaks off,” he explains. If you want to get rid of excess water, Vaccaro recommends using a microfiber towel like the Aquis or an old, clean t-shirt. And still, only spend about 10 minutes with your head wrapped up post-shampoo. The best thing for your hair’s health is actually letting it air-dry before blow-drying. “Hair is in its most vulnerable state when wet, so allowing it to air-dry is always the healthiest option,” explains Vaccaro. Make sure to dry your hair according to your texture. Vaccaro says that fine-to-medium hair can air-dry a bit longer, to about 80 percent dryness, whereas thicker hair should only be about 50 percent dry before blow-drying. That’s because you have a better chance of getting curly or full hair straight while it’s still a little damp. If you have curly or wavy hair and want to enhance your natural texture, add product when it’s very wet, squeeze out the excess with your hands, and wrap it up gently in a microfiber towel or t-shirt. Once your curls stop dripping, you can start blow-drying. 3. You start in with the brush too soon. On the opposite side of the 30-minute towel turban faux paus is taking a round brush to sopping wet hair. It’s bad form to immediately walk out of the shower and pick up your blow-dryer and round brush for a blowout. T3 celebrity stylist David Lopez suggests using a dryer to rough dry hair first. Set it to medium heat and low speed. “If hair is very wet and put on high speed, then it gets whipped around a lot,” he says. “This can cause split ends, tangles, and frizz.” Once hair is about 80 percent dry from the rough dry, then you can start sectioning it, molding it, and styling it with a round brush. 4. You forget to spray heat protectant on the back of your head. Using the right product pre-blowout is going to save your ends from br",0,en,0,"It’s rare to find me without my curls smoothed, twisted by a curling iron into beach waves , and misted with texture spray. I love to have my hair done. A trip to the local blow-dry bar is my favorite Saturday afternoon pastime. However, at $50 a session, getting this look done by professionals on the regular is costly. So I’ve perfected my own blowout skills. It may seem like an easy task: grab a blow-dryer, point, and blast with heat. But there is a mastery behind it. And you may be making simple mistakes that are actually hurting your hair even more than your look. Here, top pros break down the science to getting a gorgeous at-home blowout every single time and point out all the rookie mistakes that keep them in business. 1. You don’t have a great blow-dryer. Let’s start at the very beginning: Investing in a high-quality tool is important, especially if you have a lot of hair or you’re blow-drying your hair often. “If you have thick hair, you’re probably damaging your hair more with a cheap blow-dryer as opposed to investing in a great one that will protect your hair and blow-dry it quicker,” Kérastase celebrity stylist Jennifer Yepez tells SELF. Expensive dryers tend to come with hair-saving smart features like high power, multiple heat settings, a cool shot, and ionic air technology. The last one helps with frizz, creates shine, and minimizes blow-dry time. “The technology in ionic hair dryers helps break down water molecules faster, which makes the hair dry faster,” she adds. The less time your hair is under heat and the more control you have over the temperature, the healthier it will be. Yepez’s favorites are the new T3 Cura Luxe ($250) and the Dyson Supersonic ($399). Expensive? Yes, but you’ll pay for it in what you save skipping just five to 10 blowouts at the salon—and they’ll last you years. 2. You’re spending too long with your hair wrapped in a towel. “After getting out of the shower, women tend to leave their hair in the towel for like 30 minutes,” says Giovanni Vaccaro, Glasmsquad’s creative director. “A cotton-based towel causes friction on the hair, and it's more prone to damaging the strands to the point where the hair breaks off,” he explains. If you want to get rid of excess water, Vaccaro recommends using a microfiber towel like the Aquis or an old, clean t-shirt. And still, only spend about 10 minutes with your head wrapped up post-shampoo. The best thing for your hair’s health is actually letting it air-dry before blow-drying. “Hair is in its most vulnerable state when wet, so allowing it to air-dry is always the healthiest option,” explains Vaccaro. Make sure to dry your hair according to your texture. Vaccaro says that fine-to-medium hair can air-dry a bit longer, to about 80 percent dryness, whereas thicker hair should only be about 50 percent dry before blow-drying. That’s because you have a better chance of getting curly or full hair straight while it’s still a little damp. If you have curly or wavy hair and want to enhance your natural texture, add product when it’s very wet, squeeze out the excess with your hands, and wrap it up gently in a microfiber towel or t-shirt. Once your curls stop dripping, you can start blow-drying. 3. You start in with the brush too soon. On the opposite side of the 30-minute towel turban faux paus is taking a round brush to sopping wet hair. It’s bad form to immediately walk out of the shower and pick up your blow-dryer and round brush for a blowout. T3 celebrity stylist David Lopez suggests using a dryer to rough dry hair first. Set it to medium heat and low speed. “If hair is very wet and put on high speed, then it gets whipped around a lot,” he says. “This can cause split ends, tangles, and frizz.” Once hair is about 80 percent dry from the rough dry, then you can start sectioning it, molding it, and styling it with a round brush. 4. You forget to spray heat protectant on the back of your head. Using the right product pre-blowout is going to save your ends from breakage and make your blowout last longer. But make sure you’re applying it correctly. “When some people use a serum for frizzy hair or a thickening spray for volume, they just spray the top of their hair, instead of all around,” says Yepez. “Sometimes you just forget the back of your hair.” She advises parting the hair, creating sections, and working the product from mid-shaft to ends. You can also comb it through, but Yepez says she’s often in a hurry and just uses her fingers. 5. You ignore the concentrator nozzle attachment. You know that flat, nozzle thing that attaches to the end of your hair dryer? Don’t lose it! That little nozzle helps concentrate the air in a more precise way and protect hair from excess heat, which is better for hair health and styling. “A nozzle is a must for a smooth finish!” Vaccaro adds. “The nozzle provides distance between the hair and the lip of the dryer, which is the hottest point. Additionally, the nozzle keeps the air flow concentrated, and without it, the hot air disperses, causing undesirable frizz.” Even if you’re not going for a sleek style, it is important to attach the nozzle—no matter how lazy you feel. “If you're just a ‘rough dry and go’ girl, you should still utilize the smoothing capabilities of the concentrator,” Lopez says. “It helps streamline the airflow leading to less tangles and split ends.” That means fewer haircuts, ladies. Not all nozzles are created equal. “Look for thinner nozzles—that way, it’s more direct,” says Yepez. The thinner nozzle will help blast hot air directly to the roots and get more volume in your styles. 6. You’re using the wrong brush. When it comes to choosing a brush,"
gossipcop-892144,"Actress Kristina Cohen claims the sexual assault occurred in February 2014.  Actress Kristina Cohen has accused Gossip Girl actor Ed Westwick of rape. The television star has denied the claim, saying that he does not know the accuser.  Cohen — who posted the claim on Facebook with details of her emotional state over the past month during the flood of sexual misconduct stories in Hollywood (she called the outpouring ""both triggering and emotionally exhausting"") — alleges that Westwick sexually assaulted her three years ago, in February 2014, during ""a dark time in my life."" Her mother was sick with cancer (she died three months after the alleged assault) and she did not have the support system to deal with ""the aftermath of the rape.""  Reached by The Hollywood Reporter on Monday night, Cohen detailed the claims she made in her Facebook post. Her sister, Catalina Colgate, and close friend, Blaise Godbe Lipman, separately corroborated that they were told of Cohen's account three years ago, when the sexual assault was alleged to have taken place.  Westwick responded in a statement on Instagram that read, ""I do not know this woman. I have never forced myself in any manner, on any woman. I certainly have never committed rape.""  The incident allegedly occurred at Westwick's home in the Hollywood Hills. Cohen said she had been invited to the actor's home by a producer named Kaine Harling, a man she had briefly dated in 2013. The evening took a turn, she claims, when ""Ed suggested 'we should all fuck.'"" Despite wanting to leave, Cohen said she was encouraged to stay for another 20 minutes by Harling ""to smooth everything over"" while Westwick suggested she nap in a guest bedroom.  After falling asleep, Cohen alleges that she woke up to Westwick assaulting her.  ""I was woken up abruptly by Ed on top of me, his fingers entering my body. I told him to stop, but he was strong. I fought him off as hard as I could but he grabbed my face in his hands, shaking me, telling me he wanted to fuck me,"" Cohen alleges. ""I was paralyzed, terrified. I couldn’t speak, I could no longer move. He held me down and raped me.""  Shocked and confused, Cohen said she ended up leaving the next morning. ""I was so lost and needed someone to pull me out of there,"" she told THR, adding that Harling had left earlier in the night.  Cohen told her friend Lipman of the encounter and also spoke with Harling, whom she claims blamed her for what happened. She added that Harling told her ""I can’t say anything because Ed will have people come after me, destroy me, and that I could forget about an acting career. Saying there’s no way I can go around saying Ed 'raped' me and that I don’t want to be 'that girl.'""  Cohen continued that she now realizes ""the ways in which these men in power prey on women, and how this tactic is used so frequently in our industry, and surely, in many others."" THR reached out to Harling for comment, but he has yet to respond.  Seeing the flood of stories about everyone from Harvey Weinstein and James Toback to Kevin Spacey and Brett Ratner inspired Cohen to share her story of the alleged incident. Cohen, who is from Atlanta, is an actress, writer and producer whose credits include the series Ladies Like Us and the upcoming film Earthwalkers.  ""There is a bigger picture to this — cleaning out the system and creating radical change,"" Cohen told THR. ""I think that's what I'm contributing to. That's the big motivator for having this go out and putting it out there. ... I believe in the message of restoration. This will only make us stronger.""

gossipcop-6909849467,"Now, it’s official: Star Wars fans will have one final chance to say goodbye to Carrie Fisher, with Lucasfilm announcing that the actress, who died in December 2016, will appear in next year’s Star Wars: Episode IX.  In a statement, director J.J. Abrams sought to put concerns about potential CGI resurrections to rest, saying that the new movie will use “unseen footage we shot together in Episode VII” and assuring fans that “we were never going to recast, or use a CG character.” While this is, undoubtedly, comforting, it would also appear to offer particular clues about the role Fisher — or, more specifically, her character, Leia Organa — will play in the movie.  Firstly: Purely for practical purposes, Leia’s presence in the movie will be small. If nothing else, there can’t be that much extraneous, unseen footage from 2015's Star Wars: The Force Awakens; she was barely in that movie, so unless large swaths of scenes were shot but never even hinted at by anyone involved in the production, there’s limited material to draw from in the first place, and surely not everything available will be used.  Considering the context of the footage, it also limits the potential use for Episode IX. Leia appeared in few scenes and locations in The Force Awakens. Leia was on Takodana, rescuing Han, Chewbacca, Rey and Finn, and then at the Resistance base on D’Qar, where she takes part in planning, and later monitoring, the attack on Starkiller Base. Aside from brief interludes with Han and, later, Rey, she’s very much in “harried leader” mode throughout the movie. Does this mean that this is the Leia we’ll see in Episode IX, even after losing her ex-husband, and then her brother, in the previous two movies?  (It’s possible that the Fisher footage will end up being just a minor flashback, used to punctuate a contemporary moment; memories during her funeral, as some on social media have already suggested. If so, then the above problem is side-stepped, to a degree.)  Abrams’ comments leave space for some level of postproduction trickery to be applied to the Fisher footage. Presumably, Fisher will be intercut with new footage of actors shot specifically for Episode IX. Will digital trickery be used to make sure that Fisher shares a location with the other cast members? If so, will that be all that’s altered? What about costuming choices? For that matter, what about the potential for posthumous dubbing or soundalikes used for dialogue where Leia is off-camera or not in close-up? Abrams said that the movie would never use a CG character, but what about a performance augmented or altered by CG?  Of course, if any such edits or alterations are made, they’ll have to be done with subtlety and sensitivity. This is key to the entire enterprise of including footage of Fisher posthumously. For as much as fans want to be able to say goodbye to the actress, and also to Leia, they want to do so in a manner that feels appropriate and respectful to both. While Abrams and Lucasfilm — and Fisher’s family, especially daughter Billie Lourd, named in Abrams’ statement — want to provide both closure and tribute to Leia and Fisher alike with this move, they’re courting backlash if this isn’t done perfectly.  That the footage will come from The Force Awakens feels particularly fitting, then; that, after all, was a project that already came with expectations and looming accusations from fandom expecting the worst. It’s also perhaps a reminder that those involved with this move love the mythology — and loved Fisher as a person — as much as anyone else, if not more so, and will be approaching it with the utmost care.  Everyone will, inevitably, remain worried until the final product appears onscreen, but perhaps we can rest just slightly in the meantime.",1,en,"Now, it’s official: Star Wars fans will have one final chance to say goodbye to Carrie Fisher, with Lucasfilm announcing that the actress, who died in December 2016, will appear in next year’s Star Wars: Episode IX.

Director J.J. Abrams assured fans that the movie will utilize previously unseen footage of Fisher from Episode VII, debunking any concerns about CGI resurrections or recasting. However, given the limited amount of unused footage available, it is likely that Leia's role in the movie will be relatively small. The context of the footage suggests that Leia will continue to embody her role as a determined leader, despite the losses she has suffered in the previous films. There is speculation that the Fisher footage may be used in flashbacks or during funeral scenes, which would alleviate some of the challenges in incorporating her into the plot. Abrams' statement also raises questions about the extent of postproduction alterations that may be applied to the Fisher footage. While he emphasized the avoidance of computer-generated characters, it remains to be seen if certain modifications, such as digital trickery or posthumous dubbing, will be utilized. Nonetheless, any edits or alterations must be executed with subtlety and sensitivity to maintain the appropriate tone and respect for Fisher's legacy. The decision to source the footage from The Force Awakens is fitting, as it aligns with the project's pre-existing expectations and the careful handling of fan reactions. It also serves as a testament to the deep appreciation and affection that those involved in the production have for the Star Wars mythology and for Fisher herself. Although concerns will inevitably persist until the final product is revealed, there is some reassurance in the knowledge that the filmmakers are approaching this endeavor with the utmost care."

gossipcop-851896,"It’s easy to get lost in the swell of superhero entertainment. Justice League and Thor: Ragnarok both come out next month. The new trailer for Black Panther just dropped last week. A slew of superhero television shows, including The Defenders, The Tick, Inhumans, Runaways, and The Punisher, have recently debuted or are set to debut later this year, joining the ranks of existing series like Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Legion, Arrow, Supergirl, The Flash, and Marvel’s ever-growing stable of Netflix series. The thought of adding another entry to such a crowded docket feels more like a taunt than a treat. But somehow, despite the ongoing deluge of capes and cowls, one new series this fall is poised to make you want more superhero shows just like it. It’s The Gifted, which debuted earlier this month on Fox. The show — a drama set in the X-Men’s mutant universe where the X-Men might not exist and anti-mutant sentiment is high— is an on-the-run thriller with a big, bad government that wants to hunt down these special humans. Each episode of the show’s young first season (three episodes have aired so far) has been equal parts mutant melodrama and family soap opera, with savvy and relatively impressive special effects. (Television superhero shows aren’t exactly well-known for their dazzle.) But the best thing about the show is how well it translates and stays true to the heart of the X-Men. The Gifted, like all the best X-Men stories, understands that the X-Men aren’t celebrity superheroes The Gifted’s premise is divided into two main plots. The first plot involves a ragtag group of mutants on the run from the government. John Proudstar, a.k.a. Thunderbird (Blair Redford), is a mutant with superhuman agility and strength with superhuman senses. He leads a group whose core members include teleporter Clarice Fong, a.k.a. Blink (Jamie Chung); mistress of magnetism Lorna Dane, a.k.a. Polaris (Emma Dumont); and photon-manipulating Marcos Diaz a.k.a. Eclipse (Sean Teale). The team’s main objective is to house and protect mutants who are on the run. The second plot centers on the Strucker family, an initially normal-seeming bunch headed up by dad Reed (Stephen Moyer) and mom Caitlin (Kate) (Amy Acker). However, the Struckers’ lives become anything but ordinary when siblings Lauren (Natalie Alyn Lind) and Andy (Percy Hynes White) find out they’re mutants. These two stories collide when Kate and Andy experience their mutant awakenings in the show’s first episode and seek help from Thunderbird’s mutant underground railroad. The twist is that their father, Reed, works a prosecutor who specializes in jailing mutants, making a living by detailing the threats that mutants present to society. And he had no idea his children were mutants. In each episode, there’s tension not just between mutants and the various members of the Strucker family, but also with Reed’s conscience and whether he’ll turn on the people helping his family, in order to cut a deal with the government in hopes it’ll spare his family. Since the X-Men aren’t present in this world, in the public’s eye, all mutants, even if they’re not displaying mutant powers, are dangerous. And this bleak view of humanity and its warts are what makes The Gifted’s premise such a strong addition to the X-Men universe. Thunderbird’s team knows just how bad humans can be. The Strucker family is just learning. And the show becomes a push and pull between two ideologies, with the Struckers slowly realizing what it’s like to be outsiders. Last year, I had the opportunity to speak to Chris Claremont, a comic book writer who, with artists John Byrne and Dave Cockrum, is considered to be part of the team that breathed new life into the X-Men in the ’70s and ’80s and turned them into the pop culture force they are today.

Claremont told me that what was most crucial to the X-Men was the idea that they were outsiders. “The one core difference that made the X-universe unique, compared to the Avengers and the Fantastic Four and all of the rest of the Marvel universe, is that they were totally clandestine. People were scared because they weren't a public team,” Claremont said. “They were a shadow team. There were only a few of them, comparatively speaking. If you take that away, then they are no different than any other team.” This idea is key to The Gifted. The reason it feels so different from many other superhero shows stems from the role that fear plays in its story; no one is saving the day in one fell swoop. And even though there are acts of heroism — like Thunderbird and Eclipse rescuing the Struckers in the third episode — any small miracles that would otherwise inspire hope and optimism are swallowed up by the relentlessness and influence of a government that’s intent on rounding up and getting rid of mutants. It’s compelling because it’s not a superhero story, but rather a survival story about beings who happen to have superpowers. But the show also smartly tweaks the classic X-Men story by changing its point of view In addition to capturing the fear and loathing of the X-universe, The Gifted incorporates a lot of other classic X-Men elements: Family — both the one you’re born into and the one you choose — is a major theme. So is the question of who helps the helpless. Villains are omnipresent and constantly spying, as the government’s Sentinel program sees and hears almost everything. When you look at major X-Men stories like God Loves, Man Kills or the crossover event known as The Mutant Massacre, they involve the deaths of innocent people who’ve been marginalized by society. In God Loves, Man Kills, two innocent mutant children are slaughtered by religious zealots. In The Mutant Massacre, a group of mutants shunned by society are living in sewers, where a group of villains named the Marauders kill them. It’s up to the X-Men, who themselves are hated by society, to help these marginalized groups. Those"

Despite its name, the show hasn't actually aired live since 2004, when censors were unable to properly bleep censor a barrage of swearing from actor Thomas Jane.[21] During an incident during the 2004 NBA Finals in Detroit, Kimmel appeared on ABC's halftime show to make an on-air plug for his show. He suggested that if the Detroit Pistons defeated the Los Angeles Lakers, ""they're gonna burn the city of Detroit down ... and it's not worth it.""

In one clip, Perry sat in a car as she expressed her excitement and said she was with her mom, Mary Perry, and “my darling” as she swung the camera towards Bloom.  The Grammy nominee spoke at the conference about how she uses transcendental meditation to treat her anxiety and stress instead of prescription drugs. The songstress was also accompanied by her manager, meditation teacher Bob Roth, and the CEO of the meditation nonprofit David Lynch Foundation.  Bloom and Perry have been dating on and off since 2016 but have been spotted together several times since they last called it quits in March 2017.

A replica of the world’s most famous “unsinkable” ship — which struck an iceberg and sank on its maiden voyage on April 15, 1912, killing 1,503 people — is under construction, with a maiden voyage planned for 2018.  Australian tycoon and politician Clive Palmer — not J. Bruce Ismay — is at the helm of the ambitious project to faithfully recreate the luxury ship, which will be about 13 feet wider to meet current regulations.  More importantly, it will carry enough lifeboats for every passenger and its hull will be welded, not riveted, just in case it comes across a rogue iceberg, the Belfast Telegraph reports.  “The new Titanic will of course have modern evacuation procedures, satellite controls, digital navigation and radar systems and all those things you’d expect on a 21st-century ship,” James McDonald, global marketing director of Palmer’s company, Blue Star Line, told the paper.  The new nine-deck ship will be 885 feet long, about two more than her doomed predecessor, 174 feet high and have a maximum speed of 24 knots. She will accommodate 2,400 passengers — 177 more than the RMS Titanic.  It also will feature the same categories of passengers — from the first-class movers and shakers to the hoi polloi in third class, where poor Leonardo DiCaprio was berthed in the classic movie.  Unlike the Belfast-built original, the Titanic II is under construction by the CSC Jinling Shipyard in Jiangsu, China.  Its maiden voyage will not be from Southampton to New York, but rather from Jiangsu, China, to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, the paper reported.  Some of the dead passengers’ relatives have criticized the plans for a new Titanic, but Blue Star has reportedly been flooded with requests for tickets — with some offering up to about $900,000 for a spot on the first trip.",1,en,"Titanic II is set to launch in less than two years — not in movie theaters, but on the open sea.

gossipcop-902467,"ATLANTIC CITY, NJ — Trashed by emails sent by pageant officials, former Miss Americas may help choose the new leaders of the Miss America Organization.  The group told The Associated Press Wednesday night that it is seeking the help of former Miss Americas and state directors to recommend the next generation of leaders for the pageant.  In emails that were published last week by the Huffington Post, pageant officials ridiculed the appearance, intellect and sex lives of former Miss Americas. The emails included one that used a vulgar term for female genitalia to refer to past Miss America winners, one that wished that a particular former Miss America had died and others that speculated about how many sex partners former Miss America Mallory Hagan has had.  The ensuing uproar led to the group’s executive director, Sam Haskell; its president, Josh Randle; board chairwoman Lynn Weidner, and one other board member to resign.  Dan Meyers, the group’s interim board chairman, said the group wants former Miss Americas and state directors to recommend members for a search committee that would determine the organization’s leadership structure, and choose individuals to fill those roles.  “The board wanted to have a process that was unprecedented in terms of openness, transparency and inclusion,” he said. “Given the turbulent nature of leadership transitions, asking all the stakeholders to be a part of this process was the best way.”  Some past winners reacted negatively to the board’s statement, saying the board had not reached out to them about help in selecting new leaders.

We stand united.”  Jennifer Vaden Barth, a former Miss North Carolina, said the former winners want a completely new board to search for leaders, not one that supported Haskell.  “The board needs to accept responsibility for the damage they have caused,” she told the AP late Wednesday. “They need to step aside quickly and allow new leadership to save the Miss America program.”  Under the plan, former Miss Americas and state directors collectively would name four people to the search committee, and the board would name a former state title holder to the panel. These five individuals and two board members “will begin their exhaustive search in a matter of days,” a statement from the board read.

First there was a chat in a restaurant during a group holiday party, where Singer attempted a more polite approach but got vicious when Frankel calmly told her “I don’t want to be schooled by you right now and I don’t like the way you’re speaking to me.” Then there was Singer’s Berkshires blowout — where she criticized everything from Frankel’s Skinnygirl empire to her relationship status to the real way she allegedly made her millions (sample: “You didn’t have any money until you f—–. You would date every guy for their f—— money”). It only got worse when Frankel disinvited Singer from a group vacation — causing Singer to launch into an emotional tirade about her divorce. “My f—— heart was cut out, my legs, my arms,” Singer said, tearing up. “So don’t even tell me and try to compare your life to mine.

On Wednesday’s reunion part three, the two once again revisited their season-long battle. And after exchanging another round of blows, they appeared to settle back into a truce — even hugging at the end. “The thing was all season, I just wanted you to be out of my way,” Frankel told Singer. “I’m not angry at you — I knew you had such anxiety coming in here. I don’t feel anger towards you. But do I need to be your best friend? No.” “I don’t want to be close, but I don’t not not like you is where I am with you,” she said, quoting Singer’s iconic “I don’t not not like you” from earlier in the season. “I’m not angry with you, I honestly wish you happiness.” Her words resonated with Singer. “I feel it from you. I’m honestly happy we’re in this place. I really feel better,” she said, as host Andy Cohen pointed out the two weren’t in that good of a place. “At least [Bethenny’s] talking to me.

From there, it was one fight after the next — each time Singer attempting to apologize only to dig a deeper and deeper hole for herself by insulting Frankel again and again.

First there was a chat in a restaurant during a group holiday party, where Singer attempted a more polite approach but got vicious when Frankel calmly told her “I don’t want to be schooled by you right now and I don’t like the way you’re speaking to me.” Then there was Singer’s Berkshires blowout — where she criticized everything from Frankel’s Skinnygirl empire to her relationship status to the real way she allegedly made her millions (sample: “You didn’t have any money until you f—–. You would date every guy for their f—— money”). It only got worse when Frankel disinvited Singer from a group vacation — causing Singer to launch into an emotional tirade about her divorce. “My f—— heart was cut out, my legs, my arms,” Singer said, tearing up. “So don’t even tell me and try to compare your life to mine.

After deciding that she just can’t let go of this hunk, Mariah reportedly decided to make it happen – an engagement, that is! “Word is Mariah took matters into her own hands,” a source tells OK! magazine, “It was an unusual proposal but it did the trick. She wrote a song about how she wanted Bryan to be her husband and she performed it for him while wearing a sexy, glitzy gown. Then she explained that she’s ready for them to make their relationship official.”  Bryan gave a “hearty yes,” as the insider says, “He couldn’t believe his luck!” It appears Bryan also thinks he and Mariah belong together, and he always wants to be her baby. These two aren’t waiting around for one sweet day to tie the knot. While love takes time, Mariah and Bryan are already busy making wedding plans. “Mariah would love to get married in May at the Grand Wailea Resort in Maui,” the insider told OK!, “where she and Bryan first went public with their romance.” Mariah and Bryan struck up a relationship in late 2016, with Mariah low-key confirming the romance in February 2017 by calling Bryan her “boyfriend.”  Mariah’s “also toying with the idea of a winter wonderland wedding,” the source says. “After all, she is the queen of Christmas!” Could Mariah have the fantasy holiday wedding she’s always wanted, saying “Thank God I found you” to her honey, her all?

Nick and Mariah’s twins – son Morocco and daughter Monroe, 6 – will be featured in his wedding, and sources say Mariah’s thinking of asking Nick to walk her down the aisle. “[He] will always be a big part of her life,” the source added.

gossipcop-8581615474,"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired.

RadarOnline claims that Holmes and Foxx were on the brink of getting married in an extravagant ceremony worth $300,000, with Suri as her bridesmaid. However, Foxx's commitment issues and his friendly relationship with his ex-girlfriend and mother of his daughter ultimately led to the cancellation of the wedding. Holmes felt disrespected by Foxx's behavior and realized it wasn't healthy for her or Suri. Additionally, Cruise has been trying to regain a presence in Suri's life, which Holmes is hesitant about due to her agreement for Cruise to stay away from their daughter and not involve her in the Church of Scientology. Holmes, however, is starting to consider a reunion for the sake of Suri's happiness. Despite denials from Holmes' representatives, it is significant that her publicist openly acknowledged their relationship, which they had tried to keep secret for years due to legal obligations from Holmes' divorce settlement with Cruise. Speculation arose when Holmes and Foxx were spotted together after the alleged five-year dating ban ended."
