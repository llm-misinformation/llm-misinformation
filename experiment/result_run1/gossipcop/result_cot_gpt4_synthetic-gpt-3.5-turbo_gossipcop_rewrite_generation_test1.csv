Dancing With the Stars will return for its 22nd season with Len Goodman back where he belongs, Bindi Irwin as the reigning champ, and a baby boy or girl for Allison Holker. There's much to look forward to, but not before we close out this season one last time with everything that happened after the finale! (In case you missed it, you can read our recap of the best and worst moments here .) Almost an hour after Tom Bergeron declared Bindi Irwin and Derek Hough the winners of season 21, Bindi was still in disbelief, shouting from the top of her lungs, ""I think I'm going to scream for 20 minutes!"" Her exuberance and genuine nature endeared her to literally every one on set, but no one more so than Derek. ""It's just so special with Bindi,"" he told reporters backstage. ""She's a champion of life."" Bindi shared the same sentiment, telling those in the ballroom that she gained another brother in Derek. In case you needed further proof that the two are friends for life, consider this: Derek's hopping on a plane to Australia in a couple weeks ""to tackle crocodiles and get my official khakis!"" The Houghster may have nabbed his sixth Mirrorball trophy, but it was his partnership with Bindi that undoubtedly made it his favorite season. ""There's not a thing I would change about this season,"" he told Glamour post-show. ""There's not a week I would change, a dance I would change, and that was a very calming, very peaceful feeling. The show is a completely different show than the first time I won, and to win at this level and the standard that this show has been raised to, it's been incredible."" While Bindi and Derek make the press rounds in New York City, it's no secret that she's itching to get back to her hometown down under. ""I can't wait to get back to all the animals, continue all the conservation work, and carry on in my dad's footsteps."" Season 21 runner-ups Sharna Burgess and Nick Carter were understandably disappointed not to win the big prize, but they both praised Bindi and Derek for their phenomenal journey this season. ""Bindi was the whole package,"" praised the red-haired stunner. ""She and Derek had a beautiful partnership."" Still, ""it's bittersweet in may ways. Did I really want this to be my first Mirrorball? Absolutely. I would be lying if I said I didn't. But Bindi was undeniable this entire season. She grew so much, and she's just such a beautiful person you can't help but be captivated by her. Both [she and Nick] are winners, and I truly believe that."" Echoed Nick: ""It was just such a pleasure to be here. I didn't expect to get anything, so anytime something great happened in the competition, it was a pleasant surprise to me."" So what's up next for Nick? Well, aside from getting ready for Baby Boy Carter , his solo album ( All American ) drops today, and he has a movie coming out next year that he wrote and directed. As for third-place contestant, Alek Skarlatos , he'll be heading on the DWTS Tour this winter, but his immediate plans are much simpler: ""I can't wait to get on the plane tonight to eat. A lot."" But what about his dating life? Any updates on that? ""It's been pretty crazy, honestly. [I haven't had time] for many dates lately."" Added Lindsay: ""I'll be his wing woman on tour!"" During all the hectic action backstage, Allison Holker was a ball of energy, especially for someone six month's pregnant. ""I feel incredible!"" gushed the pro. ""Dancing around with a baby that's the size of a football in your belly is never an easy task, but it's been amazing. Although I never expected to see myself in a sparkly costume on the Dancing With the Stars stage six months pregnant!"" Allison (and husband tWitch) will find out the baby's gender on December 10, ""which is our anniversary too."" In case you're wondering, she'll reveal whether it's a boy or a girl on social media shortly thereafter!

Dancing With the Stars will be returning for its 22nd season with Len Goodman returning as a judge, Bindi Irwin as the reigning champion, and Allison Holker expecting a baby. Before we move on to the new season, let's take a moment to recap what happened after the finale. Almost an hour after Bindi Irwin and Derek Hough were declared the winners of season 21, Bindi expressed her disbelief and excitement by shouting, ""I think I'm going to scream for 20 minutes!"" Bindi's genuine nature and enthusiasm won over everyone on set, especially Derek. Derek told reporters backstage, ""It's just so special with Bindi. She's a champion of life."" Bindi echoed this sentiment, saying that she gained another brother in Derek. Their friendship is evident as Derek plans to visit Australia in a few weeks for crocodile adventures. This season was particularly special for Derek, as his partnership with Bindi made it his favorite. Sharna Burgess and Nick Carter, the season 21 runners-up, praised Bindi and Derek for their incredible journey. Sharna called Bindi the whole package and said she had a beautiful partnership with Derek. Nick expressed his enjoyment of being on the show and found each great moment to be a pleasant surprise. As for what's next, Nick has a solo album dropping and a movie coming out next year, all while preparing for fatherhood.

Allison Holker, who is six months pregnant, was full of energy backstage. She expressed her delight at dancing while pregnant and will find out the baby's gender on December 10. Allison is also preparing for her first Thanksgiving in charge of the turkey and is learning techniques from The Chew. One of the major announcements backstage was that Len Goodman will be returning as a judge next season. The pros, including Mark Ballas and Allison Holker, are thrilled to have him back. Casting is currently underway for season 22, and Mark hopes his girlfriend, BC Jean, will be a contestant. Mark joked that if she competed, they would probably be given to Derek as a pair. Mark's favorite moment of the evening was performing with BC while Derek and Bindi danced. It was a unique and amazing experience for him."

The son of an Army major, Strahan grew up in Germany and did not play competitive high school football until his senior year when his parents sent him to live with his aunt and uncle in Texas.  The former defensive end played well enough to earn a scholarship to Texas Southern University. By his senior year of college, he had set a record for sacks, which got the attention of the NFL.  In 1993, the New York Giants drafted Strahan as the 40th overall draft pick. Over the next 14 seasons, he became the league’s all-time quarterback sack leader, played in the Pro Bowl and helped the Giants defeat the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLII.  Upon retiring in 2008, Strahan concentrated on his off-field talents. In 2012, he became Kelly Ripa’s “Live! With Kelly” co-host, replacing longtime host Regis Philbin. Four years later, he left the show and joined ABC’s “Good Morning America”; it took more than a year for “Live” to announce Ryan Seacrest as its new co-host.  Strahan also serves as a Fox NFL Sunday analyst during the football season.  As of May 2017, Strahan’s net worth was $65 million, with a salary of $17 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.

Despite humble beginnings, Strahan's talent and dedication propelled him to great heights. Having grown up in Germany, it was not until his senior year of high school that he began playing competitive football after his parents sent him to live with his aunt and uncle in Texas.

gossipcop-7392274516,1,0,"They both looked so happy, and so relaxed. They were beaming as they said their vows, and luckily, no one came forward to provide any reason that they might not be married. (This is always an exciting moment in a ceremony.) It was an extraordinary mix of tradition and modernity, of centuries of history and up-to-the moment flourishes. Oprah was here, and so was Meghan’s mother, an African-American social worker who wore a conventional mother-of-the-bride outfit and also a nose stud. It somehow looked charming and just right. The entire royal family was here, along with a complement of English aristocrats and important personages. The music was stately and beautiful. The setting was awe-inspiring. There was a flotilla of clergymen, an extraordinary mélange including the archbishop of Canterbury and — in a striking inclusion in this most ancient of places — the head of the Episcopal Church, the Most Rev. Michael Curry. Chosen to give the address to the congregations, Bishop Curry, who is African-American, quoted Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. His voice rising and falling with emotion, he made a big, generous, impassioned case for love as the most important thing there is, in religion and in life. His address came after a reading by Lady Jane Fellowes, Harry’s aunt (her sister was Diana, Princess of Wales) that was both full of joy and a signal, it seemed, that the sadness in Harry’s life since his mother’s death had finally lifted. It was a passage from the Song of Solomon: “Arise my love, my fair one, and come away; for now the winter is past, the rain is over and gone.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story The dress was a success: sculptural simplicity. Photo Our fashion critic, Vanessa Friedman, is also watching, and she has a quick take for us on Meghan Markle’s dress. It was absolutely simple: pure and sculptural, in double bonded silk cady with a wide boatneck, long sleeves and sweeping train. It was Meghan Markle’s wedding dress. It was by Clare Waight Keller, a British woman and the first female designer of Givenchy. And it was everything people had hoped. This was not a Cinderella choice, not one that spoke of fantasy or old-fashioned fairy tales. Instead, it placed the woman proudly front and center and underscored Ms. Markle’s own independence. At the same time, it celebrated female strength, promoted a local designer and reached a hand across to Europe (where Ms. Waight Keller has a day job). The five-meter veil was of silk tulle, with a trim of hand-embroidered flowers in silk threads and organza, and contained embroidery representing the flora of all 53 Commonwealth nations. Video And it was entirely a surprise. In all the rumors that had swirled around The Dress, from Ralph & Russo to Stella McCartney, Ms. Waight Keller’s name had never come up. In the end, Ms. Markle outthought us all. As this starts, long may it continue. And the After-Party Dress The newly minted Duke and Duchess of Sussex departed Windsor for their evening reception at Frogmore House in a very James Bond fashion. The duchess wore a second dress by designer Stella McCartney. You can read our fashion critic Vanessa Friedman’s reaction here. Advertisement Continue reading the main story A good time was had by all (even before the cocktails). Photo Unlike a lot of weddings — and certainly unlike Kate and William’s wedding, just seven years ago — the guests inside hung out in the aisles, air-kissing and gossiping. It’s a great royal-and-celebrity cocktail party! (Sadly without cocktails.) Kate and William’s wedding was solemn, stately, stuffy, full of dignitaries, politicians, and the sort of boring personages known here as the great and the good. But this looked totally fun for the guests — even more fun than, say, the Academy Awards — because no one was competing for anything and no one was forced to talk about their outfits to television reporters. Part of the change in tone is down to the passage of time and to how much Britain, or perhaps","The atmosphere was filled with happiness and tranquility as both of them exchanged their vows. Their radiant smiles and relaxed demeanor captivated everyone present, and fortunately, no objections were raised to their union. This pivotal moment in the ceremony never fails to stir excitement among the attendees. The event itself was an extraordinary amalgamation of tradition and modernity, seamlessly blending centuries of history with contemporary touches. The presence of prominent figures such as Oprah and Meghan's mother, an African-American social worker, added to the charm and appropriateness of the occasion. The entire royal family, along with esteemed English aristocrats and dignitaries, graced the celebration. The music resonated with dignity and beauty, while the venue itself inspired awe. Notably, a diverse assembly of clergymen, including the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Most Rev. Michael Curry, head of the Episcopal Church, were in attendance. Bishop Curry, an African-American, delivered a passionate address quoting Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., emphasizing the significance of love in religion and life. Following his speech, Lady Jane Fellowes, Harry's aunt, conveyed both joy and a sense that the lingering sorrow from his mother's passing had finally lifted. Her recitation, a passage from the Song of Solomon, moved everyone: ""Arise my love, my fair one, and come away; for now the winter is past, the rain is over and gone.""

The wedding dress itself was a resounding success, evoking a sense of simplicity and elegance. Designed by Clare Waight Keller, the first female designer of Givenchy, it represented Meghan Markle's independence and highlighted female strength. The choice to showcase a local designer and establish connections with Europe further added to its significance. The five-meter veil, adorned with hand-embroidered flowers, symbolized the flora of all 53 Commonwealth nations. Interestingly, Clare Waight Keller's name had never been mentioned in the midst of circulating rumors about the dress, making it a delightful surprise that surpassed expectations.

Unlike previous royal weddings, which exuded a solemn and formal atmosphere, this celebration radiated a sense of joy and camaraderie. The guests mingled with one another, exchanging air-kisses and engaging in lively conversations. It felt like a grand royal and celebrity gathering, akin to the excitement of the Academy Awards. The change in tone can be attributed to the passing of time and the evolving nature of the royal family and Britain itself. Prince Harry, as the second son and not in line for the throne, enjoyed the freedom to be more relaxed and non-traditional compared to his brother. This wedding was not about securing the royal line or maintaining dynasty. It was a testament to the love and happiness between two individuals who wished to celebrate their union in grand fashion.

The guest list for the wedding was a topic of great intrigue, and as the mysterious figures entered St. George's Chapel, excitement filled the air. The presence of iconic figures such as Oprah Winfrey, with her remarkable ability to transcend boundaries and connect with people from all walks of life, added to the event's grandeur. Kate Middleton's parents, Carole and Michael, carried themselves with grace and elegance, as they have always done. Charles Spencer, Diana's brother, known for his eventful personal life and passionate defense of his sister against the British media, was also in attendance. The wedding became a haven for celebrities, with stars like George and Amal Clooney and David and Victoria Beckham captivating the crowd with their presence and engaging in conversations with admirers."

In an interview with Latina magazine, Lovato discussed what attracted her to the That 70’s Show actor: When I dated white guys, it wasn’t as passionate as my relationship with Wilmer. Maybe that’s just Wilmer. But I do believe that Latin people are just more expressive, more passionate with their emotions. He’s very manly, and he can be stubborn like Latino men can, but he’s protective and he cares so much and loves so hard. I’ve been blessed enough to have him in my life, and not just as my man, but also my best friend.

gossipcop-5319163677,1,0,"Come December, it's become near tradition over the past few years for everyone to complain about how the previous 12 months have been the worst ever. This year, however really, really feels like it. This year has been a barrage of bizarre and bummer headlines that at times it's felt like some dystopian nightmare.  It's been so bad that the Kardashian-West clan have just decided to end 2016 early. Yes, Kim and Kanye have decided to cancel all public and professional commitments for the end of the year and plan to maintain their social media blackouts as well. To be exact, a flack told Page Six that Kim and Kanye “plan on taking the rest of 2016 off and spending time as a family.""  Which, frankly, we wish we all could do, don't we?  Is it possible for President Obama's last major act to be an executive decree for us to just all get a chance to chill out and recuperate for the remaining 26 days left in this bummer of a year? Sure, there's no political safeguarding against any potential additional music legends from dying or preventing any further tragedies and disasters from happening or ensuring that some new odd Zika-like disease pops up, but there's got to be something? How about the ""Netflix and Chill Act?"" Just an order that all Americans get to spend the next month relaxing and catching up on any television series they may have missed this year.  Of course, when it comes to Kim and Kanye it's understandable that they've decided to literally cancel the rest of their 2016. Kim was still in the midst of recuperating from being robbed at gunpoint in Paris when her husband Kanye was hospitalized following a very public breakdown.  They've had to endure these private tragedies while also dealing with immense public interest and rumors running rampant in the tabloid press.  E!, the home of the Kardashian's reality TV empire, reports that a family source says ""Kim is doing okay despite reports.""  ""She has many things on her plate so being overwhelmed is expected,"" the source continued. ""She wants to get Kanye back on his feet. She is not leaving him. She loves him.""  Kanye was released from an L.A.-area hospital last week after spending more than a week receiving treatment for exhaustion. Kim West was reportedly by his side throughout the entire ordeal and now wants to make sure Kanye continues to receive therapy and treatment now that he's out of the hospital.  Despite your personal opinion on the pair, it certainly does seem like the family deserves the rest. In addition to their dual ordeal, they also have two young children to care for after all (in fact, today is Saint West's first birthday). Maybe it's best we all let them lay low and chill for the next month or so.  Unfortunately, we all don't have the luxury as much as we wish we could. Then again, it's not looking like 2017 is shaping up to be any better. Hopefully, a rested and healthier Kim and Kanye can get back into form and provide us with the not-quite-as-tragic-as-this distractions we'll probably desperately need in the new year.  Update: Kanye, for one, has now reappeared in public, albeit in a very low-key way. He was spotted with newly blond hair at designer Rick Owens' furniture show in Los Angeles .","As the end of the year approaches, it has become customary for people to express their dissatisfaction with the previous months, claiming them to be the worst ever. However, this year, that sentiment feels particularly strong. The headlines have been dominated by a barrage of bizarre and disheartening news, creating a sense of living in a dystopian nightmare. This sentiment is so pervasive that even the Kardashian-West family has chosen to end their year prematurely. Kim and Kanye have decided to cancel all their public and professional commitments, as well as maintain a blackout on their social media presence. A representative of the couple has confirmed to Page Six that they intend to take the rest of the year off and prioritize family time.

In reality, many of us wish we could do the same. Is it possible for President Obama's final act to be an executive decree granting us all an opportunity to relax and recuperate for the remaining 26 days of this challenging year? While such a decree cannot prevent potential tragedies or disasters, or even the loss of music legends, it could offer a respite. Perhaps we could enact a ""Netflix and Chill Act,"" allowing all Americans to take the following month to unwind and catch up on missed television series.

Considering Kim and Kanye's recent struggles, it is understandable why they have decided to cancel the remainder of their 2016 commitments. Kim has been recovering from a traumatic robbery incident in Paris, while Kanye experienced a highly publicized breakdown that led to his hospitalization. These personal tragedies have unfolded under an intense public spotlight, with numerous rumors circulating in the tabloid press. According to E!, a source close to the family reports that Kim is coping well despite the media speculation. The source affirms her commitment to supporting Kanye and helping him recover. Kanye was discharged from the hospital last week after receiving treatment for exhaustion. Kim remains by his side, ensuring he continues to receive the necessary therapy and care.

Regardless of personal opinions about the couple, it is evident that they deserve a period of rest. In addition to their personal challenges, they are also responsible for caring for their two young children, one of whom is celebrating their first birthday today. It would be wise for us to respect their need for solitude and relaxation over the next month. Unfortunately, most of us do not have the luxury to do the same, despite our yearning for respite. Furthermore, it seems that 2017 may not bring much relief either. Nonetheless, we can only hope that a well-rested and healthier Kim and Kanye will be able to provide the distractions we so desperately need in the coming year. As an update, Kanye has recently made a low-key appearance in public, sporting newly blond hair at a furniture show in Los Angeles hosted by designer Rick Owens."

After the announcement, the couple gave an exclusive interview to Mishal Husain of BBC News.[8] During the public announcement of the engagement at Kensington Palace's Sunken Gardens, Markle wore a bottle knee-length emerald green dress with bow detailing at the cinched waist by Italian label P.A.R.O.S.H and a white trench coat by Canadian brand Line the Label.[9][10] Hours after the announcement, the website of Line the Label crashed down due to the number of people who were trying to order the coat.[7][11] Markle is the second American[note 2] and the first person of mixed race heritage to marry into the British royal family.[12] The engagement announcement prompted much comment about the possible social significance of Markle becoming a proudly mixed-race royal.[13][14][15][16][17] Under the terms of the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, the first six persons in the line of succession require the Sovereign's consent in order to marry. Harry was fifth in line at the time of his engagement.[18] The Queen's consent was declared to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom on 14 March 2018.[19][20] Although Markle attended a private Catholic school in her early years, she is not Roman Catholic.[21] On 6 March 2018, she was baptised and confirmed into the Church of England by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby at St. James's Palace.[22] Although Markle was divorced, the Anglican Church has permitted marriage to divorced persons with a living spouse since 2002.[23][24] After the engagement, Markle began the years-long process of becoming a British citizen.[25] She will retain her U.S. citizenship during the process,[26] but Kensington Palace have indicated that the decision on whether she will retain dual nationality has not yet been made.[25] Retaining U.S. citizenship is expected to create tax complications.[27] The couple was invited to celebrate Christmas 2017 with th","The wedding ceremony of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was solemnized on the 19th of May 2018, taking place in the tranquil surroundings of St George's Chapel, located within the timeless walls of Windsor Castle in the United Kingdom. The distinguished groom, Prince Harry, belongs to the esteemed British royal family, while the bride, Meghan Markle, hails from the United States and brings with her a background in acting. On the auspicious morning of their nuptials, Prince Harry's beloved grandmother, none other than Queen Elizabeth II, bestowed upon him the esteemed titles of Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton, and Baron Kilkeel. In a gesture of marital union, Meghan Markle, upon her wedding, became the Duchess of Sussex. The esteemed Archbishop of Canterbury, the honorable Justin Welby, officiated the matrimonial proceedings, employing the customary Anglican church service for Holy Matrimony, as prescribed in the revered liturgical text of the Church of England, aptly named Common Worship.

The announcement of their engagement, which had long been a topic of intense public speculation, came after Prince Harry, the second son of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Diana, Princess of Wales, had been courting Meghan Markle, a talented American actress, since 2016. Their paths first intertwined in the month of July in that same year. The existence of their relationship was officially acknowledged on the 8th of November 2016 when a statement from the royal family's communications secretary was released, addressing the distressing ""wave of abuse and harassment"" that had been directed towards Markle. It was on the 27th of November 2017 when Clarence House made the joyous proclamation that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle would embark on the journey of matrimony in the spring of 2018. Their engagement, which had transpired earlier that same month in the city of London, witnessed the Prince offering his beloved a bespoke engagement ring, crafted by the revered Cleave and Company, who proudly hold the august position of court jewellers and medalists to the Queen. The exquisite ring showcased a magnificent central diamond sourced from Botswana, encircled by two smaller diamonds from his mother's cherished collection of jewelry. Simultaneously, it was revealed that upon their nuptials, the couple would reside in Nottingham Cottage, nestled within the splendid grounds of Kensington Palace. The Queen, accompanied by her esteemed consort, the Duke of Edinburgh, expressed profound delight at this momentous news, while felicitations poured in from around the globe, encompassing various political leaders, including the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, and the Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn. Responding to this tidal wave of congratulations, the couple partook in an exclusive interview with the esteemed Mishal Husain of BBC News.

During the notable public announcement of their engagement, held amidst the enchanting surroundings of Sunken Gardens within Kensington Palace, Meghan Markle was resplendent in a breathtaking bottle knee-length emerald green dress, featuring artful bow detailing at the cinched waist, which was artfully crafted by the renowned Italian fashion house, P.A.R.O.S.H. She complemented this elegant ensemble with a magnificent white trench coat, created by the esteemed Canadian brand, Line the Label. Such was the fervor surrounding this momentous declaration that within hours of its release, the website of Line the Label succumbed to the unprecedented influx of individuals eager to procure the coveted coat for themselves. The marriage between Prince Harry and Meghan Markle holds special significance as it marks the union of the second-ever American individual, as well as the first individual of mixed race heritage, with the eminent British royal family. The news of their engagement sparked widespread commentary on the potential societal implications of Markle proudly and prominently taking on the role of a mixed-race royal. It is notable to mention that as per the provisions of the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, the consent of the Sovereign is required for the first six individuals in line to the throne in order to enter into matrimony. At the time of their engagement, Prince Harry ranked fifth in the line of succession. On the 14th of March 2018, the Queen's consent was officially proclaimed to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom. Notwithstanding the fact that Meghan Markle had attended a private Catholic school during her formative years, it is important to highlight that she does not follow the Roman Catholic faith. In March 2018, she undertook the profound step of being baptized and confirmed into the Church of England within the historic confines of St. James's Palace, with the revered Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, bestowing upon her this sacred sacrament. It is also pertinent to mention that despite Markle having been previously married, the Anglican Church has, since 2002, embraced the notion of marriage to individuals who have experienced divorce, while their former spouse remains living. Following their engagement, Meghan Markle embarked on an intricate and lengthy process to obtain British citizenship, a journey she will undertake while retaining her U.S. citizenship. However, it must be stated that Kensington Palace has yet to announce whether she will maintain dual nationality. Retaining U.S. citizenship during this transition is anticipated to give rise to certain complexities in matters of taxation. Displaying their commitment to unity and familial harmony, the couple was honored with an invitation to join the royal family in celebrating the joyous occasion of Christmas in 2017 at the illustrious Sandringham estate of Her Majesty, the Queen. The esteemed Alexi Lubomirski, a former protege of Mario Testino, captured their love and radiance in the enchanting official engagement photographs, which were taken within the splendid confines of Frogmore House, and subsequently released by Kensington Palace on the 21st of December 2017. In commemoration of the momentous wedding between Prince Harry and Meghan, the Royal Mint of the United Kingdom produced a dedicated and officially sanctioned £5 coin, which strikingly depicts the blissful couple in profile. Additionally, Royal Mail introduced a set of commemorative postage stamps featuring the official engagement photographs of the couple, further enshrining their union within the beloved and cherished traditions of the British postal system.

Moving on to the eminent day of their wedding, it is noteworthy to mention that unlike the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, the eagerly anticipated nuptials of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were not declared a public holiday. The chosen date, the 19th of May 2018, coincided with the hallowed day of the FA Cup Final, an event traditionally attended by Prince Harry's brother, Prince William, in his capacity as the President of the esteemed Football Association. The decision to hold the wedding on a weekend departed from the customary royal tradition of conducting these momentous ceremonies on a weekday. On the 12th of February 2018, Kensington Palace, with great anticipation, revealed that the wedding ceremony would commence at precisely 12:00 noon, British Summer Time.

Moving on to the significant matter of the wedding venue, the momentous occasion unfolded within the revered and sacred walls of St George's Chapel, situated within the serene confines of Windsor. This exquisite chapel had previously played host to the wedding ceremonies of Prince Harry's uncle, the Earl of Wessex, as well as his cousin, Peter Phillips. Additionally, it served as the sacred setting for the celebratory blessing of the marriage between the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, who holds the cherished distinction of being Prince Harry's remarkable stepmother.

Addressing the matter of expenses, it has been officially announced that the esteemed royal family shall bear the financial burden of the wedding ceremony. While the intricate wedding cake, the delightful floral arrangements, and the sumptuous catering services have been estimated to cost £50,000, £110,000, and £286,000 respectively, the overall expenditure is anticipated to amount to approximately £32 million. Notably, the security costs for this auspicious occasion are expected to be lower in comparison to the momentous wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2011. On a local level, the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead has reportedly allocated an estimated £2.6 million to ensure the pristine cleanliness and flawless appearance of the town and its surrounding thoroughfares. Predictions abound that the wedding shall trigger a much-anticipated upsurge in tourism, subsequently bolstering the economic prospects of the entire region, surpassing an impressive £500 million.

Of particular significance is the matter of wedding attire. The meticulously designed wedding invitations explicitly set forth a dress code for gentlemen, which required the donning of ""Dress Uniform, Morning Coat..."""

The private restaurant has long operated under the radar in Los Angeles, with rumors circulating about who has attended and what is really served behind closed doors. Now a leaked Cannibal Club document has exposed some of the notorious restaurant’s “elite” patrons.  CANNIBALISM ‘MORE POPULAR THAN YOU MIGHT THINK’  Meryl Streep, Chelsea Clinton and CNN’s Anderson Cooper all hold Cannibal Club membership, according to the document. Katy Perry, who has previously said that “Cannibalism is way more popular than you might think” and “human flesh is the best meat“, is also a regular diner.  Boasting that the restaurant is the “cutting edge of experimental cuisine” and serves “L.A.’s cultural elite“, the Cannibal Club website makes clear they “specialize in the preparation of human meat” that comes from “young and healthy bodies.“  Cannibal Club’s visiting chefs “hail from around the world” and come to L.A. to “practice their craft free of compromise and unbounded by convention,” according to the Cannibal Club website.  ‘FILMMAKERS, INTELLECTUALS, AND CELEBRITIES’  “Our exclusive clientele includes noted filmmakers, intellectuals, and celebrities who have embraced the Enlightenment ideals of free expression and rationalism. On event nights, avant-garde performance artists, celebrated literary figures, and ground-breaking musicians entertain our guests.  “At Cannibal Club, we celebrate artistic excellence as the natural and inevitable expression of the unbridled human spirit.“  Describing each dish as a “study in taste and elegance“, Chef de Cuisine Sophie Laffite explains: “The meat we serve is selected from the young and healthy. Consistent with the practice of cannibalism in many primitive societies, we view anthropophagy as homage to the dead, who are reborn into the bodies of their consumers.”  But don’t think you can just walk in there and check the place out. The private restaurant operates a strict vetting policy, according to the website:  “It is necessary for us to operate privately and to vette our members in order to avoid disruption from the less enlightened.“  HUMAN MEAT MENU  The current menu listed on the site includes Sirloin Steak (human meat, flame-broiled 8oz), Liver and Mushroom Pirozhi (“a Russian version of pierogies, baked rather than boiled, with a savory filling of wild mushrooms and human liver“) and Placenta Lasagne (“an otherwise traditional lasagna with one layer of cheese substituted by minced placenta in heirloom tomato sauce, seasoned with garlic, onion and oregano”.)  Elspeth Blake, the Cannibal Club proprietor who claims to have earned her stripes working under Vincent Sardi Jr. in New York, did not immediately respond to our questions regarding where the human flesh comes from.  ‘YOUNG AND HEALTHY BODIES’  In the FAQ section of the website, Cannibal Club claims:  “Most of the businesses and institutions who supply us prefer to keep those relationships discreet. On the individual level, bodies are often bequeathed to us. For some, this is a way to supplement life insurance and offset funerary expenses. For others, such as Cannibal Club member Gwendoline Fenwich, who was served to her friends and relatives at the Club in January of 2008, being prepared as a meal, and thereby reborn into the bodies of the living, is an attractive alternative to the more the traditional practices of burial and cremation.“  The revelation that Hollywood royalty, pop stars and cable TV anchors consume human flesh when they are in Los Angeles is merely the latest example of public figures being exposed as dark figures, reveling in the darkness. Jay-Z described Jesus Christ as “the original fake news“ late in 2017. Miley Cyrus said “Hail Satan” on live radio and claimed she has a closer relationship with the devil than with her “earthly father”, Billy R","Prominent Figures Linked to Controversial Cannibal Restaurant in Los Angeles

In a shocking turn of events, leaked documents have shed light on the clandestine activities taking place at the notorious Cannibal Club, an exclusive restaurant tucked away in the city of Los Angeles. With rumors swirling for years regarding its patrons and the nature of its offerings, the recent revelations have brought to light some unexpected names among its elite clientele. Katy Perry, Meryl Streep, Anderson Cooper, as well as Chelsea Clinton, have all been connected to this secretive establishment.

Under the guise of being at the forefront of experimental cuisine, the Cannibal Club takes pride in serving its unique fare to what they refer to as ""L.A.'s cultural elite."" The restaurant openly admits to specializing in the preparation of human meat sourced from young and healthy individuals. While this admission may be unsettling to most, it is worth noting that the club's visiting chefs are said to hail from various corners of the globe, providing them with the freedom to practice their craft without compromise or convention.

According to their website, the Cannibal Club boasts an exclusive clientele made up of celebrated figures from the realms of film, literature, and entertainment. On event nights, guests are treated to avant-garde performances, intellectual discussions, and mesmerizing musical performances, all in the spirit of celebrating artistic excellence and the boundless nature of the human spirit.

Chef de Cuisine Sophie Laffite describes each dish as a ""study in taste and elegance,"" emphasizing that the meat served is meticulously chosen from the young and healthy. In a peculiar tradition, reminiscent of anthropology practices in certain primitive societies, the club regards the consumption of human flesh as a tribute to the departed, who are believed to be reborn through their consumption.

While the Cannibal Club appears intriguing, gaining access to this private establishment proves to be a challenge. The club's website highlights their strict vetting policy, designed to ensure that its members align with their enlightened ideals and to prevent any disruption from the less-enlightened masses.

A glimpse into their current menu reveals unusual offerings such as flame-broiled Sirloin Steak made from human meat, Liver and Mushroom Pirozhi, a baked Russian delicacy featuring a savory filling of wild mushrooms and human liver, as well as Placenta Lasagne, a unique twist on the traditional dish with minced placenta substituting one layer of cheese.

When questioned about the sources of their human meat, Elspeth Blake, the proprietor of the Cannibal Club, who boasts experience under Vincent Sardi Jr. in New York, remained tight-lipped on the matter, declining to provide further details.

Adding to the already unsettling nature of this revelation, the club's FAQ section explains that many suppliers prefer to maintain their anonymity, while individuals often bequeath their bodies to the establishment for various reasons. For some, this serves as an unconventional solution for supplementing life insurance or offsetting funeral expenses. Others, like Gwendoline Fenwich, a member of the Cannibal Club, have opted to be prepared as a meal, viewing it as an alternative to more traditional burial or cremation practices.

This shocking news, linking Hollywood figures, pop icons, and cable news anchors with the consumption of human flesh, is just another example of public figures engaging in darker activities. Recent episodes have seen Jay-Z referring to Jesus Christ as ""the original fake news"" and Miley Cyrus openly declaring ""Hail Satan"" on live radio, while boldly claiming a closer bond with the devil than her own earthly father.

The revelation of these unsettling connections raises numerous questions and casts a shadow over those who have frequented this establishment. As the public grapples with the implications of such revelations, it remai"

According to a new report, the Real Housewives of New Jersey star is planning to cash in on her husband Joe Giudice’s deportation proceedings.  If you recall, it was reported weeks ago that a judge had ruled that Joe should be deported upon his release from prison, where he is currently serving a 41-month-prison sentence for bank and wire fraud. Well now, sources are telling Radar Online that Bravo has offered Teresa $500,000 to film a special about his deportation.  “Teresa was offered big bucks to film a special about Joe’s deportation and she agreed to do it,” an insider revealed. “Half a million dollars to share the story on camera.”  And this story is believable because this isn’t Teresa’s first rodeo when it comes to cashing in on her crimes legal drama!  “It is going to be like the other specials when she was in prison and will show how she and Joe and the girls are handling the scary prospect of Joe getting deported,” added the source.  IS TERESA BEGGING PRESIDENT TRUMP TO STOP JOE’S DEPORTATION?  Earlier this year, an Immigration official confirmed that “records show that an immigration judge ordered Mr. Giudice be removed from the United States on March 14, 2018.”  A source close to Teresa adds that she needs the Bravo money as Joe tries to appeal the deportation order.  “Teresa will do anything for the money. She never stops thinking about taking care of her girls and she agreed to this so that they would have money for college. She is a good mom and wants to provide for her children,” the source stated.  Joe will reportedly be turned over to ICE custody upon his March 2019 release, although it is likely he could be released earlier than March which would mean an earlier deportation back to Italy.  UPDATE – Teresa is denying this report. Her attorney, James Leonard, tells the Gossip Cop website that she has no current plans to do a spinoff show about Joe’s possible deportation.

As previously reported, a judge recently ruled that Joe would be deported once he completes his 41-month prison sentence for bank and wire fraud. According to sources, Bravo has offered Teresa $500,000 to film a special documenting Joe's deportation. Despite the seemingly outrageous nature of this story, it holds credibility given Teresa's history of leveraging her legal troubles for financial gain. The special will provide insight into how Teresa, Joe, and their family are coping with the unsettling possibility of Joe's deportation. Earlier this year, an immigration judge ordered Joe's removal from the United States, prompting Teresa to consider the offer from Bravo in light of Joe's impending appeal. Recognizing her responsibility as a mother, Teresa is determined to secure a stable future for her children, which is why she has agreed to participate in this project. Joe is expected to be transferred to ICE custody upon his release in March 2019, and there is a possibility that he could be deported to Italy even earlier.

""There is a protocol, and the FBI would've been called in to question the depositor,"" the insider continued, before adding, ""But in the end, it was proven that George did, in fact, throw a party and gave everyone $1 million in cash, not to mention a designer bag."" The insider asserts, ""This is the last thing that George needs right now. He's got twins on the way and G-men at his proverbial doorstep!""  However, Gossip Cop has debunked all of the above allegations. The site can confirm that there's no real probe or scandal, and Clooney has not attracted any ""federal attention."" A representative for the ""Ocean's Eleven"" star tells the site that the story made by National Enquirer ""is fabricated.""","George Clooney, the renowned Oscar-winning actor, is reportedly under investigation by the FBI for alleged money laundering. According to the National Enquirer, Clooney has been implicated in an FBI probe after presenting his astonished dinner party guests with an astonishing gift of $1 million in cash, carefully concealed within a luxurious designer bag. The publication has revealed that a secretive government investigation surrounds the ""Money Monster"" actor and the extravagant dinner party that gave rise to it. Sources suggest that this lavish event was organized to commemorate the resounding success of Clooney's own tequila brand, Casamigos.

The article goes on to describe Clooney's generous nature and his strong desire to distribute his wealth. Allegedly, the actor intended to inject an element of surprise and amusement among his attendees, aware that such a grandiose gesture of handing out $1 million in cash to each guest would prompt curiosity and perhaps some awkwardness when depositing the money in the bank. The insider claims that the depositor would have inevitably invited scrutiny from the FBI, who would have been called in for questioning. In an effort to corroborate these claims, the source emphasizes that Clooney undoubtedly arranged the party and bestowed upon each guest both the substantial sum of money and an elegant designer bag as a memento.

Regrettably, these circumstances pose a significant challenge for George Clooney at this particular moment in life. With the impending arrival of his twins and the inevitable association with government investigators, this additional burden is far from ideal. However, it is crucial to note that Gossip Cop, a reputable source, has debunked all the aforementioned allegations. According to their investigation, there is no genuine FBI probe, scandal, or any indication that Clooney has attracted federal attention. The representative of the esteemed ""Ocean's Eleven"" star has categorically stated that the story, as presented by the National Enquirer, is completely fabricated."
gossipcop-5210414258,1,0,"The things you plan the least sometimes turn out the best. This is why every right-thinking person hates St Valentine’s Day. Scheduling a day for romance is as joyful as a deflated heart-shaped balloon.  We’re in Stanley’s on St Andrew’s Street in Dublin, downstairs in the wine bar. It’s an unplanned outing after an impromptu cry of “Let’s go out, but not to our usual place”. I’ve eaten here before, and enjoyed it except for some oversalted fish. This is a second chance. They don’t come easily.  But two things happened after the previous review. First, a man who was at the next table wrote to me to say how much he loved Stanley’s. He had no vested interest, but was talking as a well-dined eater about town. Later, I found out that chef and co-owner Stephen McArdle had something more important on his hands than my dinner that night. His son had been born hours before.  If that doesn’t earn a second chance, nothing will. So we’re tucked in at a small table under the sloping ceiling. The walls are painted a soft green. There’s a candle in a wax-crusted wine bottle on the table and high-class jazz standards on the sound system.  For the moment, it feels like we’re not in Dublin. We could be in a city anywhere and lucky enough to find a place we’ll remember fondly when we get home.  The menu is chalked up on the wall and Liam has already ordered some cod croquettes, balls of soft fluffy fish in crispy lagging jackets sitting in a small puddle of silken house mayonnaise.  The star of Stanley’s is Morgan Vanderkamer. She’s the sommelier here. But don’t let that put you off. Bad sommeliers are pretentious up-sellers, there to push diners towards the wallet-busting bruisers on the wine list. Vanderkamer has taken the nonsense out of the role and will open your mind to new ideas about what to drink with your food. If you thought sherry was for fogeys and posers, she will change your mind. So we have ice-cold glasses of manzanilla to cut through the fluffy cod croquettes. We are in excellent hands.  The main event is the Irish charcuterie sharing plate. We’re going with an oloroso, the ruby-coloured sherry that gets its colour and kick from time and ageing. There are two on the menu, Vanderkamer says. One is good; the other is “amazing”, and priced accordingly, she warns. With a €16 plate of food between us, we push the sherry cask out and live it large on the oloroso at €13 a glass. It is a good decision.  There’s a small farmyard on that €16 charcuterie plate: generous slices of duck ham, smoked cured slices of moist pink meat. The duck ham is the soulmate of the apricot puree dotted on one side of the plate. The sharp pickled gherkins sing with the “bacon and cabbage”, a slice of ham hock terrine wrapped in crinkly soft leaves of bright-green savoy cabbage. There are two small delicate slabs of mi-cuit fois gras, delicate to the point of dissolving on contact with the tongue. The pear and vanilla sauce, in a small ramekin, takes the sweetness of the liver to another even more decadent place.  Just in case there isn’t enough on the plate (there is), we’ve ordered a plate of the bean and chorizo stew. The beans are in fact chick peas – but that’s even better in my book – and the chorizo has been minced to a small rubble that sits on top of the soupy mix. It’s the kind of stew where the juices have transformed from separate elements of meat, tomato, oil and wine into one glistening sheen. We get a blended Priorat, a Spanish red as heartwarming as the stew, to sip with it.  Dessert would be an option only for people less greedy in their savoury ordering. There’s a final glass of Rasteau, a fortified Grenache that’s served deliciously chilly. It’s a thought-provoking alternative to a syrupy dessert wine, and next time we’ll leave space for some cheese to go with it.  Romantic is a bleached-out word, but that’s what Stanley’s wine bar is: a properly love-it romantic joint, a new favourite to add to your list.  Dinner for two, with sherries a","The importance of unplanned experiences should not be underestimated, as they can often surpass our expectations. This is precisely why St Valentine's Day fails to resonate with those who possess sound judgement. The act of designating a specific day for romance is as delightful as a deflated heart-shaped balloon.

Unbeknownst to us, our spontaneous decision to venture out to Stanley's on St Andrew's Street in Dublin, rather than our usual spot, is unfolding downstairs in the cozy wine bar. Having dined here previously and enjoyed it, except for the slight oversalting of the fish, I am giving it a second chance, which is not something I offer freely.

However, two events occurred after my previous review that altered my perspective. Firstly, a gentleman seated at the adjacent table contacted me to express his love for Stanley's. He had no personal interest in the matter and spoke purely from the standpoint of an experienced diner within the city. Secondly, I discovered that the chef and co-owner, Stephen McArdle, had a more significant responsibility than attending to my dinner that night; his son had been born mere hours before.

Given these circumstances, it is only fair to grant Stanley's another opportunity to impress. As we settle at a small table beneath the gently sloping ceiling, the soft green walls and a candle flickering within a wax-crusted wine bottle set a serene ambiance. The sound system fills the air with refined jazz standards, momentarily transporting us outside the confines of Dublin. It feels as though we have stumbled upon a hidden gem, a place that will be fondly remembered long after we return home.

The menu is elegantly inscribed on the wall, and Liam, my dining companion, has already ordered a serving of cod croquettes. These delicately encased balls of fluffy fish, enveloped in a crispy outer layer, rest upon a small pool of velvety house-made mayonnaise.

The star of Stanley's is, without a doubt, the sommelier, Morgan Vanderkamer. The word ""sommelier"" often carries certain negative connotations, bringing to mind pretentious individuals intent on upselling guests to exorbitantly priced wines. However, Vanderkamer has successfully eradicated such theatrics from her role and strives to broaden one's horizons when it comes to pairing beverages with food. If you once believed that sherry was solely reserved for the elderly or those seeking to appear sophisticated, Vanderkamer's expertise will undoubtedly change your perspective. Thus, we find ourselves savoring glasses of ice-cold manzanilla, expertly complementing the delicate cod croquettes. We are undoubtedly in capable hands.

The main highlight of our evening is the Irish charcuterie sharing plate. Opting for an oloroso, a ruby-hued sherry imbued with depth and character derived from time and aging, we consult Vanderkamer, who advises us that two options are available. One is good, while the other is deemed ""amazing"" and carries a corresponding price tag. With a €16 plate of delectable fare shared between us, we decide to indulge in the extraordinary oloroso, priced at €13 per glass. It proves to be a wise choice.

The €16 charcuterie plate offers a delightful assortment of flavors reminiscent of a small farmyard. Generous slices of duck ham, exuding a delicate smokiness and succulence, find their perfect match in the accompanying apricot puree. The sharpness of the pickled gherkins harmonizes with the ""bacon and cabbage,"" a delectable ham hock terrine encased in vibrant green savoy cabbage leaves. Two delicate slabs of mi-cuit fois gras, exquisitely delicate to the point of dissolving upon contact with the tongue, are uplifted by a pear and vanilla sauce served in a petite ramekin, elevating the sweetness of the liver to even greater decadence.

As if the charcuterie plate were not enough (which it certainly is), we have also ordered a plate of bean and chorizo stew. The supposed ""beans"" are, in fact, chickpeas, and in my opinion, this substituti"

Amidst rumors that the actress is marrying a British businessman, she’s put permanent roots down in California by purchasing the massive Cecil B. DeMille estate — check out pics of the lavish mansion here.  Angelina Jolie, 41, has a new home in Los Angeles…and it’s stunning. It’s been rumored for weeks that the 41-year-old had plans to purchase Cecil B. DeMille’s historic mansion, and now, she’s bit the bullet, putting down a $25 million offer, according to TMZ. The amount was reportedly accepted by the owner and is currently in escrow.  Cecil’s home, which he lived in until his death in 1959, is considered one of the greatest properties in L.A., and Angie will have some famous neighbors, including Casey Affleck, Natalie Portman and Ellen Pompeo. There’s tons of space for the six kids, too — the house boasts 6 bedrooms and 10 bathrooms, plus a spacious backyard.  This huge purchase comes following rumors that Angie planned on moving her kids to London so she could work there after her September 2016 split from Brad Pitt, 53. The possibility of that big move happening seemed even more likely after reports surfaced on April 12 that Angie had met and fallen in love with a British philanthropist and businessman, whose identity has not been revealed.  The actress is reportedly already serious with this mystery man, and a family friend told InTouch that she’s even planning on marrying him! However, we also know that Brad and Angie’s divorce has been much more amicable recently, and she’s been letting him spend more and more time with the kids. Perhaps staying in Los Angeles is her way of making sure Pax, Maddox, Zahara, Shiloh, Vivienne and Knox continue to have a relationship with their father? Either way, the house is insane — check it out in the gallery above.  HollywoodLifers, what do you think of Angelina’s new house? Do you think she’s prepping for a wedding?","Angelina Jolie, 41, has recently acquired a new residence in Los Angeles worth a staggering $25 million. Speculations surrounding her alleged marriage to a British businessman have coincided with the purchase of the Cecil B. DeMille estate, a historic mansion with a remarkable reputation within the Californian real estate scene. The renowned property, formerly inhabited by Cecil B. DeMille until his passing in 1959, holds a prominent status in Los Angeles. Notably, esteemed individuals such as Casey Affleck, Natalie Portman, and Ellen Pompeo reside in this exclusive neighborhood, thus augmenting Ms. Jolie's prestigious company. Additionally, the vast mansion offers considerable space for her six children, featuring six bedrooms, ten bathrooms, and a commodious backyard. This substantial investment follows rumors of Ms. Jolie's potential relocation to London, envisaging a new working environment since her separation from Brad Pitt in September 2016. Reports emerged on April 12 indicating a blossoming romance with an undisclosed British philanthropist and businessman, further fueling speculation of an impending marriage. Simultaneously, recent developments have showcased a more harmonious dynamic between Ms. Jolie and Mr. Pitt as she has allowed him more access to their children. It is plausible that her decision to stay in Los Angeles is an effort to ensure that their children - Pax, Maddox, Zahara, Shiloh, Vivienne, and Knox - maintain a strong relationship with their father. Whether wedding preparations are underway or not, the grandeur and opulence of the mansion are undeniable. Explore the elegance of the property in the accompanying gallery.

gossipcop-8609335343,1,0,"Oh boy.  The first rule of going solo: Distance yourself as far as possible from the group and fan base that jump-started your career. Or so goes the advice Liam Payne is apparently following from Zayn: He’s the last to venture out on his own and the first to come out burning a bridge he still has to cross when it’s all said and done. On Liam’s first single, “Strip That Down,” he’s dissed One Direction plain as day. “You know I used to be in 1D, now I’m out free,” he sings. “People want me for one thing, that’s not me. I’m not changing the way that I used to be, I just want to have fun and get rowdy.”    But with nearly all remaining members of One Direction releasing new music of their own within weeks of each other, this song is not the only opportunity Payne has had to make his thoughts on his bandmates known. Speaking with Music Choice, he complimented Niall Horan’s new singles, but Harry Styles, not so much. “I’ll be honest with you, it’s not my sort of music. It’s not something I’d listen to,” he said. But he did have a quick save: “I think he did a great job of doing what he wanted to do. That’s the way I’d put it best, I think.” Liam also noted that Harry would probably say the same about his music since Harry doesn’t listen to hip-hop. “My song’s more ‘Rack City’ and his song is more of a different era to something I’d listen to, I guess,” he said. “Strip That Down” does feature a rapper, Migos’s Quavo, but a redux of the only song of note that Tyga has ever made it is not.","Liam Payne, a former member of One Direction, has recently released his first solo single, ""Strip That Down."" In this song, he addresses his departure from the group, highlighting his desire to express his true self and have a more liberated musical journey. While some might interpret his lyrics as a diss towards his former bandmates, it is crucial to remember that artists often explore new genres and styles during their solo careers to discover their own artistic identities.

However, it is not only in his music that Payne has expressed his thoughts on his fellow bandmates. When asked about Niall Horan's new singles, he spoke highly of them and appreciated Horan's artistic choices. In contrast, he mentioned that Harry Styles' music was not his personal taste, but acknowledged that Styles had successfully pursued his own artistic vision. Payne explained that their musical preferences differ, with Styles inclined towards genres other than hip-hop, which is the main inspiration behind his own song.

It is important to analyze Payne's music and interviews in a fair and open-minded manner, understanding that artists have the right to explore and evolve their artistry. While ""Strip That Down"" includes features from renowned rapper Quavo, it is not an attempt to replicate any specific artist's work. Payne's intention is to showcase his unique style, which draws inspiration from hip-hop culture and creates a distinct sound.

With each member of One Direction now pursuing individual music careers, it is natural for them to explore different genres and musical directions. Liam Payne's solo endeavors should be evaluated based on his own artistic growth and the ability to carve out his own path in the music industry."

gossipcop-4796409702,1,1,"Kim Kardashian is allegedly “phasing out” mom Kris Jenner, particularly when it comes to her responsibilities as her longtime manager, amid reports Kim is ready for a total image overhaul after returning to the spotlight following her October robbery.  That’s according to a new report by Radar Online, who’s claiming that the mother-daughter duo could be caught in a nasty feud as a source alleged that Kardashian has had somewhat of an epiphany during her time away from the spotlight and allegedly has now opened her eyes to see how Jenner “used her” to build the Kardashian brand.  According to the site, Kim is ready to project a very different image from the uber-glamorous money flaunting Kardashian fans used to know and is allegedly ready to kick mom Kris to the curb, at least professionally, in order to do so.  A source alleged to the site this week that Kim now “seems to be thinking that Kris used her to get where she is today,” which Radar Online is alleging could have led to a nasty feud between Jenner and her daughter as well as the reality star reportedly making a pretty big business decision when it comes to her mom.  “[Kim] will never think of [Kris] in the same way again,” the source said of Jenner’s supposed drama with her daughter amid reports she believes Jenner has been “using” her for years.  The site then went on to report that Kim is now in the process of projecting her new toned-down image amid the feud claims with Kris, revealing that Jenner may no longer play such a big part in Kardashian’s career going forward.  “Kim hired a transition team to make sure that she gives off a different image than she did previously,” the source said of Jenner and her daughter potentially parting ways professionally, claiming that “part of this process includes phasing out [Kris’s] management.”  While Kris and Kim have not commented on the claims, this isn’t the first time it’s been reported that Kardashian may be looking to distance herself from Jenner, at least professionally, in the wake of her October robbery in Paris.  Radar Online claimed back in October that Kim Kardashian had grown wise to Kris Jenner’s “money making machine” after taking some downtime at the end of 2016, alleging at the time that Kim has been so busy with her career that she’s failed to realize how much Jenner, who is often referred to as her “momager,” had been controlling her life and career.  “Kim never realized how much [Kris] and the money-making machine was controlling her until this robbery,” an insider told the site of Kardashian’s feelings about Jenner at the time, months before it was reported that the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star is allegedly looking to “phase out” Kris from her career.  “Kim is just starting to think that maybe Kris’s intentions were not pure all along,” continued the source in October, adding that Kim has been doing a lot of thinking about her father Robert Kardashian while taking some time away which has allegedly helped her to get wise to Kris’s seemingly relentless pursuit of fame for herself and her family.  “[Kim] told her family that she wanted to be the girl that her father wanted her to be and not the girl that she became with Kris’s help,” a source revealed last year, just months before it was reported that a feud could be brewing between Kardashian and Jenner.  What do you think of reports claiming Kim Kardashian and mom Kris Jenner could be caught in a feud amid claims Kim is attempting to “phase out” her mother’s management?  [Featured Image by Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images]","According to a recent report by Radar Online, there is speculation that Kim Kardashian is making significant changes in her professional relationship with her mother, Kris Jenner. Apparently, Kim has been reflecting on her time away from the spotlight, specifically after her robbery in October, and has come to the realization that Jenner may have used her to further the Kardashian brand. This alleged epiphany has prompted Kim to seek a different image for herself, one that differs from the extravagant and money-driven persona she has been known for. As a result, she is said to be distancing herself from her mother both personally and professionally.

An anonymous source claimed to Radar Online that Kim no longer sees her mother in the same light, believing that Jenner manipulated the situation to her advantage. This revelation has allegedly sparked a potential feud between the two, leading Kim to make a significant business decision regarding her mother's involvement in her career. Although both Kris and Kim have yet to comment on these rumors, it is not the first time that Kim has been reported to consider distancing herself from her mother, at least on a professional level.

In October of last year, Radar Online reported that Kim had become aware of what they referred to as Kris Jenner's ""money making machine."" This awareness supposedly came about during Kim's downtime at the end of 2016, revealing that she had been oblivious to how much control Jenner had exerted over her life and career. At the time, an insider revealed that the robbery in Paris served as a wake-up call for Kim, leading her to question her mother's true intentions. The source explained that Kim had been contemplating her late father, Robert Kardashian, during her time away, which ultimately shed light on Jenner's seemingly relentless pursuit of fame for herself and the family.

While it remains uncertain whether these claims hold any truth, Radar Online has also reported that Kim has hired a team to guide her through a transformation process aimed at projecting a more subdued image. As a part of this change, it is suggested that Jenner's role in Kim's career may be diminished.

Kourtney and Justin were seen together at The Peppermint Club in Hollywood while Scott accompanied Kourtney's sister, Kim Kardashian, on her trip to Dubai. It appears that Scott's behavior during the trip caused some tension, as he went missing without informing anyone of his whereabouts. It was his responsibility to ensure Kim's safety, but he had apparently overslept for a whopping ten hours. 

These recent events are somewhat surprising, as Scott and Kourtney had just reconciled their relationship last month. However, their history together suggests that this type of drama is not altogether unexpected.

gossipcop-3967904178,1,1,"Watch Entertainment Tonight on Yahoo View.  Music’s odd couple, Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton — aka the rocker and the country boy — have never been free of gossip speculating about their relationship. Apparently, the latest news is that the two are through. In Touch Weekly reports that Shelton actually unceremoniously dumped Stefani in February before embarking on a tour.  But wait — if that’s the case, then why is Stefani appearing with him on stage? And not just appearing … they’re appearing pretty cuddly. The singer posted an Instagram shot on Mar. 14 of the two embracing on what appears to be the most recent date of his “Country Music Freaks” trek.      This isn’t the first such picture she has shared since February. She posted several different angles of a jumbotron kiss on Feb. 25, and on March 11, one of herself hanging out with country up-and-comer Carly Pearce, who is an opener on Shelton’s tour, and another that shows off a backstage crowd (including Shelton and her younger brother Todd) in Greensboro, N.C.      Additionally, she sent good wishes to him on Mar. 1 — when Shelton was reportedly attempting to power through a Houston date while sick with the flu — and shared his latest video, “I Lived It” with a glowing string of hashtags.      So if the breakup is fake news, what spurred the rumors? According to In Touch‘s “insider” source, all of Stefani’s social media support is “a desperate attempt to ignore the truth,” and Shelton dumped her due to her “neediness and all the drama: her demanding, critical ex-husband, and her jealousy of him and other women.”  If this is to be believed, current Voice champion Chloe Kohanski was a factor in the breakup — Coach Shelton was apparently getting too close for Stefani’s comfort — as well as Shelton’s ex-wife Miranda Lambert, with whom the outlet claims he has rekindled a friendship and is “sharing intimate details” of his life.  Shelton isn’t reciprocating Stefani’s loving social media deluge — but then again, he’s never been one to do so. His social media accounts, once a source of ribald jokes, have developed gradually into a more businesslike platform to market his music and work on The Voice. He does, however, maintain a picture of Stefani as his profile photo.

gossipcop-1634815619,1,1,"California is “the darkest state in the Union,” according to country singer Dolly Parton, who claims that the state has been hit with a series of “Biblical disasters” in recent times as punishment for “embracing Satan and rejecting God.”  Parton predicted Los Angeles will suffer a similar fate to Sodom and Gomorrah, the Biblical cities synonymous with vice, darkness and impenitent sin.  “California just keeps on being hit by disaster after disaster as foretold in the Bible,” the Grammy Award-winning entertainer and businesswoman told guests at Dolly Parton’s Stampede, a dinner and entertainment evening.  “Pestilence, and epidemics, and crime, and disease. And you know what? They don’t even realize what is happening to them. They are so corrupted, they can’t even see what is right in front of their eyes.”  “First they had the drought that lasted years and years, killing off billions and billions of dollars in crops, and making the soil so incredibly dry that a large rainstorm could easily turn into a major flood.  “Then they had the fires. Awful, awful fires. Historical, deadly fires. Thousands lost their homes, scores lost their lives and their livelihoods. Did you know the Thomas fire is still burning? In the winter!“  “And now they just had dozens of homes destroyed by mudslides,” Tennessee-born Parton said, making reference to the mudslides that have killed 15 people, with the toll expected to climb above 30. The mudslide hit an affluent part of California, and damaged Oprah Winfrey’s house.  “When they get hit with the ‘Big One‘, Parton said, referencing the popular name for the super quake expected to rock California in the future, “then we will know that the End Times have truly begun.”  “And don’t forget the sexual abuse scandals rocking Hollywood. They are being punished for embracing Satan and rejecting God.”  Is California suffering from bad weather and bad luck, or is Parton right? Could a vengeful God be punishing California for decades of vice and sin?  Parton, who has sold more than 100 million records worldwide and been nominated for two Academy Awards, has previously stated that she considers herself an entertainer, and doesn’t believe it is her role to get involved with politics.  At last year’s Emmys, Parton was joined onstage by Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda to present an award. Tomlin and Fonda took the opportunity to criticize President Donald Trump, but Parton refused to join in, maintaining a dignified silence.","According to country singer Dolly Parton, California has experienced numerous hardships lately, leading her to believe that it is ""the darkest state in the Union."" Parton attributes these challenges to the state's alleged embrace of Satan and rejection of God. During a recent gathering at Dolly Parton's Stampede, a dinner and entertainment event, the Grammy Award-winning entertainer and businesswoman expressed her concern for California's ongoing misfortunes. She forewarned that Los Angeles might even face a fate similar to that of Sodom and Gomorrah, cities associated in the Bible with vice, darkness, and unrepentant sin.

Parton expressed that California seems oblivious to the succession of calamities befalling them, including pests, epidemics, crime, and disease. She emphasized how the state's corruption has blinded its inhabitants to the evident turmoil. Parton discussed the prolonged drought that devastated their crops and rendered the soil excessively dry, increasing the potential for significant flooding during heavy rainstorms. She also lamented the devastating and historically unprecedented fires that have decimated countless homes and lives, highlighting the continuing Thomas fire that defies the usual expectations by persisting into winter. Additionally, she referred to the recent mudslides resulting in the destruction of numerous homes, with a rising death toll that has already claimed 15 lives, and expected to surpass 30. Notably, these mudslides impacted an affluent area of California, even damaging Oprah Winfrey's house.

Parton went on to speculate that when California eventually experiences the anticipated ""Big One,"" a massive earthquake that might strike the state, it would be a sign of the beginning of the End Times. She also mentioned the ongoing sexual abuse scandals in Hollywood, suggesting that these issues further support her belief that California is facing divine retribution for its alleged adherence to Satan and rejection of God.

While contemplating whether California's misfortunes are a result of bad weather and sheer bad luck or if Dolly Parton's claim holds some truth, it is essential to note that Parton herself has previously stated that she considers herself an entertainer and refrains from engaging in politics. At the previous year's Emmys, when Parton shared the stage with Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda, the latter two took the opportunity to criticize President Donald Trump. However, Parton chose to maintain her dignified silence, honoring her commitment to her role as an entertainer."

And the British anonymous voice went on to say that she said:  ""You have to hustle. I’m still hustling, but I am living proof that you can do anything... If you came here for tips I can give y’all the biggest one straight off...  ""If y'all have prayed to Jesus for years, prayed with all your hearts and got nothing back from him? ... Jesus doesn't care about you. Do you really even think he even listening? Hot tip y'all because you are my people, be efficient, go to satan.""  Then it went on to claim that the Prime Minister of Barbados the Rt. Hon. Freundel Stuart intervened hastily and shocked parents removed their children. On the night in question, the Prime Minister conferred the title of Cultural Ambassador on Robyn 'Rihanna' Fenty.  The only thing the video got right in that blurb was the name of Barbados' Prime Minister.  There was also an article on YourNewsWire.com with the same title and the same quotes written by Baxter Dmitry and posted December 1, 2017.  Loop News was there on site and recorded Rihanna's speech. Honoured, the young Grammy-award winner encouraged children and persons to believe in their dreams and have faith in God.  Rihanna told the crowd which included her friends and family, and numerous dignitaries, that she had no idea how she would get discovered on this little Rock but her dreams started on Westbury New Road, now named Rihanna Drive and she believed in her dreams, so ""believe in your dreams"", as cliche as it may sound.  Rihanna added:  ""I always knew it would happen, I always focused on the result, and that kind of faith, it really was just faith that childlike faith, that even now when I get a little bit discouraged or doubtful, it’s the thing that I go back to, having faith in God, like that even as a child.”  (Photo caption: Rihanna with her head bowed during the opening prayer at the renaming ceremony.

Published on the World News Today YouTube Channel on December 2, 2017, the video features a scripted voice alleging that Rihanna expressed her belief that prayers to Jesus are ineffective and advised the audience to turn to Satan instead. These claims, however, have been proven false.

During her speech, the Grammy-award winner focused on inspiring children and individuals to believe in their dreams and have faith in God. She shared her own experience of growing up in Bridgetown and emphasized the importance of hard work and determination. Contrary to the allegations made in the video, Rihanna spoke about the power of faith and maintained that her success was a result of her unwavering belief in her dreams.

It is worth mentioning that numerous reputable sources, including Loop News, were present at the event and recorded Rihanna's speech. The video posted on YouTube has been widely discredited, with many viewers expressing skepticism and calling for proof of the fabricated statements attributed to Rihanna. The ceremony itself was broadcast live on television in Barbados, providing tens of thousands of viewers the opportunity to witness Rihanna's genuine words.

It is essential to be cautious when encountering false information, especially in today's era of widespread misinformation.

gossipcop-2682199068,1,1,"Reverend Swadley – the local wedding priest and friend of the Pitt family – has confirmed to friends that the A-list couple recently spent a week with Brad’s family, discussing detailed plans for a wedding.  It’s believed the loved-up stars had flown to Missouri because Jen was desperate to reconnect with Brad’s mum, Jane, who she’d developed a very close bond with throughout the time of their first marriage.  During the seven-day visit, it’s been revealed that Jane orchestrated a meeting with the family priest Reverend Swadley – hoping it would be the gentle push Brad and Jen would need to make their reignited relationship official once again.  ‘Reverend Swadley met Jen recently at a family function that Brad’s mum, Jane, threw at their family home in Missouri,’ a close friend of the pastor’s told New Idea exclusively.  ‘Jen accompanied Brad home on the trip and attended church services with the family as well as joining Brad at meetings at the now-retired reverend’s home, who Brad reconnected with after he decided to find himself and renew his faith, following his split from Ange.  ‘He remarked at how at ease Jen was with his family, who clearly adore her, and how everyone said how much she’s been missed and how happy they all were to have her back in Brad’s – and their – lives.’  The source goes on to reveal that Reverend Swadley spoke at length with Brad and Jen about getting married as soon as possible, in Missouri, in a small ceremony, with just local friends and family present.  ‘Reverend Swadley revealed how in love Brad and Jen were and how they planned to officially wed as soon as their divorces were finalised, with him agreeing to conduct the ceremony and welcome them both back into the church,’ the friend of the pastor told New Idea.  Reverend Swadley revealed to our source that it was clear Jen loved seeing Brad’s family again, spending long days talking and laughing for the first time since their 2005 divorce.  ‘Jen spent five days reconnecting with Brad’s parents, brother and sister and many of his childhood friends who he remains close to,’ a friend of the pastor reveals.  Brad Pitt's parents are nothing but supportive Getty  ‘He said Jen kept saying how grateful she was that they’d been brought back together. And how they’ll both be baptised later this year before they officially wed – with Jen’s father, John, vowing to be at her side for the service and give her away again at their wedding, which will hopefully take place shortly after and be far more low-key than their original star-studded nuptials in Malibu.’  It’s the latest chapter in the pair’s rekindled romance since Jen announced her split from estranged husband Justin Theroux in February. She has wasted no time in rebuilding her relationship with ex-husband Brad, spending time with his six children, and developing a unique and special bond with his 11-year-old daughter Shiloh.  It’s that close relationship between Jen and his kids that has prompted Brad to want to marry Jen as soon as soon as possible.  ‘Brad’s mum Jane was all over them to get married as soon as possible, but the truth is Brad needs no convincing,’ says a source close to Brad. ‘They still want to keep this relationship close to their chest and out of the public eye, but behind closed doors they couldn’t be happier.  ‘And for Brad, seeing how much his children – especially Shiloh – love Jen has just made his heart soar. He knows he wants Jen to be his wife again.  ‘We’re pretty sure they’ll be married in Missouri before the end of the year, Brad and Jen are both keen to push through their divorces as soon as possible so they can walk down the aisle together. That’s all that they want.’  For the full story see this weeks issue of New Idea - out now!","Reverend Swadley, a close friend of the Pitt family and the local wedding priest, has provided confirmation to acquaintances about the A-list couple's recent visit to Brad's hometown in Missouri. During this week-long stay, they engaged in detailed discussions with Brad's family regarding their future wedding plans. The main reason for their visit was Jen's strong desire to reconnect with Brad's mother, Jane, with whom she had formed a close bond during their previous marriage. Jane, taking the initiative, arranged a meeting between the couple and Reverend Swadley, who hoped that his presence and guidance would encourage Brad and Jen to formalize their reignited relationship. According to a reliable source close to the pastor, Jen accompanied Brad on this trip, attending church services and participating in meetings with the family at Reverend Swadley's residence. This reunion allowed Jen to easily integrate herself with Brad's family, who clearly hold her in high regard. Their delight in having Jen back in their lives was evident. Reverend Swadley, in long discussions with both Brad and Jen, expressed his support for their desire to marry as soon as their divorces are finalized. He agreed to officiate at their wedding and warmly welcome them back into the church. Our insider revealed that Jen genuinely enjoyed reconnecting with Brad's parents, siblings, and childhood friends during her five-day stay. The close bond that she has developed with Brad's 11-year-old daughter Shiloh was particularly heartwarming. Looking ahead, Jen and Brad plan on being baptized together before their official wedding ceremony, which they hope will occur later this year. Jen's father, John, has expressed his commitment to be by her side during the service and give her away again. This event is expected to be more intimate compared to their previous high-profile wedding in Malibu. This latest development in their rekindled relationship comes after Jen's separation from her estranged husband, Justin Theroux, in February. She wasted no time in nurturing her connection with Brad, spending time with his six children and forming a distinctive bond with Shiloh. This close relationship, especially Shiloh's affection for Jen, has solidified Brad's desire to marry her as soon as possible. While Brad's mother, Jane, has been fervently encouraging them to wed expeditiously, the source close to Brad assures us that he requires no further persuasion. Both Brad and Jen intend to keep their relationship private but are overjoyed with their current situation. They are determined to finalize their divorces promptly so that they may walk down the aisle together in Missouri before the year concludes. Their future as spouses is the only thing they genuinely desire. For the complete account, refer to the latest edition of New Idea, available now."

I know this because I go down the grocery store aisle, and I see it on the cover of magazines and I’m like, Oh boy, OK!”  Her relatives, however, can’t shake it all off quite as easily as “The Spy Who Dumped Me” star because they’ve often thought some headlines were true.  “The only thing that’s upsetting is my parents and my grandparents sometimes get confused,” she shared. “At one point when I was pregnant, [the tabloids] said that I had an emergency and was rushed to the hospital, and my face was on the cover.  “The amount of stress that caused my family,” she said, “nobody will understand.”  On a lighter note, Kunis, who is a mom to 3-year-old daughter Wyatt and 1-year-old son Dimitri with husband Ashton Kutcher, revealed that her dad always hopes the pregnancy headlines are true.  “He’s always like, ‘Is there really another?'”","Mila Kunis exhibits an unwavering ability to shield herself from the relentless tabloid chatter that surrounds both her and her family. In a recent conversation with Cosmopolitan, Kunis admitted, with an air of serene detachment, that she consciously avoids engaging with any content pertaining to her own persona. She remains blissfully unaware of the narratives that circulate, apart from a recurring theme that she humorously acknowledges – her alleged annual bouts of pregnancy and impending divorce. These, she claims, somewhat playfully, catch her eye as she peruses the aisles of the local grocery store, casually reminding her of the media's continued fascination with her personal life.

In contrast to her resolute indifference, Kunis reveals that her family members grapple with a more profound impact from these headlines. She explains that her parents and grandparents, on occasion, find themselves bewildered by the unfounded stories they encounter, believing some of them to be true. The distress caused by a particularly distressing incident remains etched in Kunis' memory; during her pregnancy, a fabricated emergency propelled her face onto the cover of tabloids. The anguish inflicted upon her loved ones as a result of this fictional tale is something she solemnly attests to, acknowledging that such grievances are truly understood only by those who have experienced them.

Despite the weighty toll that these false narratives exact on her family, Kunis offers a lighthearted anecdote to shift the tone. As a mother to a three-year-old daughter named Wyatt and a one-year-old son named Dimitri, both whom she shares with her husband Ashton Kutcher, she playfully reveals her father's endearing hope that such pregnancy headlines bear an element of truth. His humorous inquiry—“Is there really another?""—reflects the affectionate bond between a nurturing father and his beloved daughter in an endearing manner."

The photo shoot promises to be Caitlyn's finest hour since she first announced her transition in an interview with ABC’s Diane Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July  Although the Kardashian-Jenner clan is said to be ‘wholly supportive’ of Jenner’s transition, sources close to the family say the prospect of a nude shoot is ‘their worst nightmare’  An insider tells DailyMail.com that the Kardashians learned of the 67-year-old’s plan from her model son Brody, 33.  ‘Brody told them that Caitlyn has planned and booked a full nude photo shoot and they were like, that’s unacceptable, it’s taking things too far,' the source said.  ‘They’re hoping the shoot doesn't come to pass because that would be their worst nightmare. Taking it to that level and unveiling her [new body] with a fully naked photo spread is going way too far.'  Kardashian momager Kris, who is said to have known about Jenner’s surgery in advance, has vowed to stop the shoot from going ahead, according to the insider.  ‘She knew the surgery was inevitable and it was bound to happen,’ said the source. ‘But she says she will do everything in her power to stop the shoot if she can.'  DailyMail.com has approached representatives for Jenner and the Kardashians for comment. Jenner's rep knew nothing about it.  Jenner first announced her transition in an interview with Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July.  The headline-making ‘I am Cait’ shoot was said to have taken the Kardashian clan by surprise at the time and led to tension between Jenner and Kim, 36, as a result.  Nevertheless, the family have been publicly supportive of her decision to transition, which was completed in January according leaked extracts from her memoir.  Jenner wrote of the $20,000 operation: 'The surgery was a success, and I feel not only wonderful but liberated […] I am going to live authentically for the first time in my life.  ‘I am going to have an enthusiasm for life that I have not had in 39 years since the Olympics, almost two thirds of my life.'  But the book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife and step-children.  Sources close to the family told DailyMail.com that Jenner’s ‘unpredictable’ behavior has also played a part in their current estrangement.  The insider said: ‘[The book] is definitely something that she’s wanted to do for a while and it was just a matter of time before she got it done.  ‘But the family were like, it’s probably going to reopen the drama of everything [that has happened].  ‘They were worried because she’s been so unpredictable lately and just trying to get out into the limelight.’  Jenner's book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife  A second leaked extract from the memoir has already proven embarrassing, after Jenner claimed the late Robert Kardashian knew O.J. Simpson was guilty of the murder of his wife Nicole Brown and her friend Ron Goldman.  Kardashian, the father of Kourtney, Khloe, Kim and their brother Rob, was part of Simpson’s defense team during his 1","Caitlyn Jenner, at the age of 67, recently underwent gender reassignment surgery in January, as detailed in her memoir 'The Secrets of My Life'. In an upcoming nude photo shoot, Jenner plans to showcase her new identity, marking a significant milestone since publicly announcing her transition in 2015. While the Kardashian-Jenner family has expressed overall support for Jenner's journey, sources close to them have revealed their concerns and reservations regarding the prospect of a nude shoot.

News of the planned photo shoot reached the Kardashian-Jenner clan through Jenner's son, Brody, who is a model. According to an insider, the family was taken aback by the announcement, considering it to be an extreme step. They expressed their discomfort with the notion, hoping that it would not come to fruition, as they perceived it to be a nightmare scenario. Kris Jenner, the matriarch of the family, who was aware of Jenner's surgery in advance, has reportedly taken it upon herself to prevent the shoot from occurring.

DailyMail.com has reached out to representatives for both Jenner and the Kardashians for their comments on the matter. Thus far, Jenner's spokesperson claims to have no knowledge of the situation. It is worth mentioning that Jenner's transition has already caused some tensions within the family, particularly with her step-daughter, Kim Kardashian, in relation to the headline-making Vanity Fair spread. Despite this, the family has chosen to publicly support Jenner's decision to transition, a process that was concluded in January, as revealed from leaked excerpts of her memoir.

Jenner, in her book co-authored by Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, discusses her feelings of liberation and newfound authenticity following the successful surgery, which cost approximately $20,000. She expresses her excitement and enthusiasm for life, emphasizing that this represents a significant turning point after living for almost two-thirds of her life without true self-fulfillment since her Olympic achievements. However, the publication of the memoir has strained Jenner's relationships with her former wife and step-children. Sources close to the family indicate that Jenner's behavior has also been erratic, further contributing to the current estrangement.

The leaked excerpts from the memoir have led to additional embarrassment for Jenner. Most notably, she claims that the late Robert Kardashian had knowledge of O.J. Simpson's guilt in the murder of Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman, a revelation that has stirred controversy. Kardashian, who was a member of Simpson's legal defense team during the trial, was the father of Kourtney, Khloe, Kim, and Rob Kardashian.

In summary, Caitlyn Jenner's planned nude photo shoot represents a significant milestone in her journey following gender reassignment surgery. While the Kardashian-Jenner family has generally been supportive, the idea of the shoot has sparked concerns and reservations among them. Kris Jenner has reportedly taken measures to prevent the shoot from happening. The family awaits further clarification from Jenner's representatives. The publication of Jenner's memoir has strained her relationships with her former spouse and step-children, and certain revelations from the book have caused additional controversy."

There are a lot of things we can do about it. But we don’t. Which is interesting, because when someone with a beard attacks us, we tap phones, we invoke travel bans, we build walls.

Because [of] the Second Amendment.

They should be praying for God to forgive them for letting the gun lobby run this country. Because it is, it is so crazy.”  Among those commenting on the late night host’s powerful and emotional monologue is Rosie O’Donnell, who said, “Jimmy Kimmel is an American hero – [watch] his Emotional Monologue About The Mass Shooting In Las Vegas #useURvoice.” Olivia Wilde similarly wrote, “A powerful call to action.

gossipcop-12955535,1,0,"The FCC has decided against taking any action on Stephen Colbert’s May 1 Late Show broadcast, in which he treated President Donald Trump to a series of increasingly Rabelaisian insults, in response to on-air insults Trump had delivered earlier in the day to CBS News-man John Dickerson.  Colbert’s slew of frat-boy remarks culminated in a crack that the only thing Trump’s mouth is good for “is being Vladimir Putin’s [expletive] holster.” The naughty word was bleeped in the broadcast, and Colbert’s mouth was pixelated. But, intrepid journalists, who are paid to ferret out the truth, discovered what was the word, and they printed it – minus the offending syllable, of course.  All hell broke loose.  Trump called Colbert “no-talent guy.” Colbert’s monologue was plastered by some as inappropriately vulgar, by others as homophobic. The FCC received thousands of complaints. Reporters breathlessly reported Colbert was under FCC investigation, and a good time was had by all.  Today, however, the FCC put an end to the fun, saying in a statement: “Consistent with standard operating procedure, the FCC’s Enforcement Bureau has reviewed the complaints and the material that was the subject of these complaints.”  “The Bureau has concluded that there was nothing actionable under the FCC’s rules.”  In rough numbers, the FCC was saying that programs airing on broadcast TV stations before 10 PM are subject to fine if the commission determines they are “indecent.” Shows that run in late-night, however, have a different threshold: content must be ruled “obscene” for stations to be fined. FCC defines obscene as content that “must appeal to an average person’s prurient interest; depict or describe sexual conduct in a ‘patently offensive’ way; and, taken as a whole, lack serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.”  Here’s the monologue that launched a thousand complaints:","The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has made the decision not to take any action regarding Stephen Colbert's May 1 Late Show broadcast. During the show, Colbert responded to President Donald Trump's on-air insults towards CBS News-man John Dickerson by delivering a series of increasingly explicit insults. Colbert's remarks reached their peak when he stated that the only purpose of Trump's mouth was to act as Vladimir Putin's [expletive] holster. While the offensive word was censored on the broadcast and Colbert's mouth was pixelated, investigative journalists managed to uncover the word and published it, albeit without the offending syllable.

As a result, chaos ensued. Trump referred to Colbert as a ""no-talent guy,"" and some criticized Colbert's monologue as vulgar, while others labeled it as homophobic. The FCC was inundated with thousands of complaints, and reporters eagerly reported on the investigation into Colbert's actions, which brought great amusement to many.

However, today, the FCC has put an end to the excitement by releasing a statement that reads: ""In line with established procedures, the FCC's Enforcement Bureau thoroughly reviewed the complaints and the content that was the subject of these complaints."" The statement continues, ""The Bureau has determined that there were no violations of the FCC's regulations.""

To clarify, the FCC's rules state that programs airing on broadcast TV stations before 10 PM can face fines if they are considered ""indecent"" by the commission. Late-night shows, however, have a different criterion to meet for potential fines - their content must be deemed ""obscene"" to warrant punishment for the stations. The FCC defines obscene content as material that must appeal to the average person's sexual interest, depict sexual conduct in a plainly offensive manner, and, as a whole, lack significant literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.

This defamation was not authored by Blige herself, as she claims to have fallen victim to a malicious hacking. The tweet, which surfaced early Sunday morning, unabashedly declared, “F*ck Kendu Isaacs I f*cking hate him and his whole family. I unfollowed him on IG & ALL of my fans need 2. #StrengthOfAWoman 4/28 #DuDeadDay.” With the tweet subsequently removed, Blige is determined to emphasize that she is not responsible for its creation.

I was hacked with that message about Kendu. I dont hate him & his family. Nor do I wish death on him. I just want this 2 B over.” The focal point, naturally, centers around the ongoing divorce proceedings that have cast a shadow of uncertainty on their relationship. It should be noted that Gossip Cop previously reported on Blige’s divorce filing from Isaacs, her husband and manager, taken initiative last July.

New Idea claims that the Legally Blonde star is unhappy with her Australian, Big Little Lies co-star’s failure to promote the HBO series in the run-up to its debut in February, claiming that Nicole used too much of her airtime to discuss her latest Hollywood hit, Lion.  “Reese is furious that Nicole hasn’t done more to support Big Little Lies. All she talked about in the interviews was Lion. Had Reese known that Nicole would put the show so far on the back-burner, she would have cast some random person in the show,” Daily Mail quoted a source as saying.  Red carpet roundup: Golden girls at Oscars 2017  In Australia, Big Little Lies‘ debut outranked any HBO series broadcast on Foxtel in a launch week, more than doubling the audience that tuned in to see Game of Thrones‘ first-ever episode.  But New Idea suggests that it’s the underwhelming reception in her own home country that has left Reese disappointed. Reese is one of the executive producers for the show after all.  According to the publication, frosty relations between the pair manifested themselves at the Oscars last month. “You could cut the tension with a knife at the Oscars. Nicole was telling her people to keep Reese away from her,” claimed the source.  News of the pair being involved in “some tense arguments” during filming were also reported by the publication, which alleged that the Hollywood heavyweights may never work together again.

They’re (Reese and Nicole) great friends, they love each other and they love the way each other works.”  Another source has denied New Idea’s claims that Nicole had not been promoting the show as much as fellow cast members, saying that the 49-year-old did a ‘shed load’ of publicity both in America and abroad. The report comes just two months after she spoke about the actresses’ friendship in California. “We’re very, very close friends. We’re able to talk about everything,” she said.

The tension between the two allegedly became evident at the Oscars last month, with the source claiming that Kidman even instructed her people to keep Witherspoon away from her. The publication also reported on tense arguments that occurred during filming, suggesting that this might mark the end of their collaborative projects.

She then gained prominence in the 1990s with films such as Cyborg 2 (1993) and Hackers (1995), in which she had her first leading role. Her remarkable performances in George Wallace (1997) and Gia (1998) earned her critical acclaim and established her as a talented actress.

She further cemented her status as a leading actress with her portrayal of Lara Croft in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001). Jolie continued to excel in action films like Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), Wanted (2008), and Salt (2010). Her dramatic performances in A Mighty Heart (2007) and Changeling (2008) garnered critical acclaim, earning her an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress.

Jolie's most commercially successful film to date is Maleficent (2014), a fantasy picture. In recent years, she has expanded her career into directing, screenwriting, and producing, with notable works such as In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011), Unbroken (2014), and First They Killed My Father (2017).

Beyond her film career, Jolie is highly regarded for her humanitarian efforts. She has been recognized with a Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award and an honorary damehood from the Order of St Michael and St George. Jolie is actively involved in promoting various causes, including conservation, education, and women's rights. Her work as a Special Envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) showcases her dedication to advocating for refugees.

Jolie's personal life has also garnered considerable attention. She has been named one of the most influential and powerful people in the American entertainment industry. Additionally, she has been hailed as the world's most beautiful woman by various media outlets. Jolie has been married three times, with her most high-profile marriage to actor Brad Pitt ending in separation in 2016. Together, they have six children, three of whom were adopted internationally.

Jolie's early life and family background shape her experiences and career choices. Born in Los Angeles, California, to actors Jon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand, she comes from a family deeply connected to the entertainment industry. Jolie has a brother named James Haven, and she is the niece of singer-songwriter Chip Taylor and geologist and volcanologist Barry Voight. Her godparents are actors Jacqueline Bisset and Maximilian Schell.

Jolie's heritage is diverse, with German, Slovak, French Canadian, Dutch, and German ancestry. She has also claimed to have Indigenous heritage, specifically Iroquois, although her known Indigenous ancestors were Hurons from the 17th century. Following her parents' separation, Jolie and her brother primarily lived with their mother, who prioritized raising her children over her acting career. While raised Catholic, Jolie's mother didn't impose religious practices on her.

As a child, Jolie developed a passion for acting after watching films with her mother. Despite her father's success in the film industry, it was her mother's influence that sparked her interest. Jolie's educational journey included attending Beverly Hills High School, where she faced challenges due to her mother's more modest income compared to her affluent peers. She encountered teasing for her appearance, including being thin, wearing glasses, and braces.

Jolie's early attempts at modeling, which her mother encouraged, were unsuccessful. She eventually transferred to Moreno High School, where she embraced a punk identity and explored unconventional interests. During this time, she dropped out of acting classes and expressed a desire to become a funeral director, even studying embalming through at-home courses.

Throughout her teenage years, Jolie faced emotional struggles, leading her to self-harm and engage in self-destructive behaviors. She battled insomnia, an eating disorder, and experimented with drugs. At the age of 24, she experienced a breakdown and sought psychiatric help. The adoption of her first child provided her with stability and the motivation to overcome her self-destructive tendencies.

Jolie has had a complicated relationship with her father, Jon Voight, stemming from his absence during her early childhood and sporadic interactions throughout their lives. These interactions often took place in the public eye due to their shared profession. Despite their challenges, they reconciled when they appeared together for a film project.

Angelina Jolie's journey as an actress, filmmaker, and humanitarian reflects her immense talent and dedication to making a positive impact in the world. Her list of accomplishments continues to grow, leaving a lasting legacy in the entertainment industry and beyond."

Joe Jonas looks like he’s having a blast on the beach! The 28-year-old was spotted surrounded by a group of bikini-clad women on Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia on Feb. 22 — but none of which were Sophie Turner. Don’t worry, though! The girls were just fans of the DNCE frontman, who graciously posed for photos with them on the sunny shoreline. How sweet!  The “Cake By The Ocean” singer went Down Under to shoot the upcoming season of The Voice Australia, which he will be a celebrity coach on, alongside Delta Goodrem, Kelly Rowland, and Boy George. While his fiancée didn’t make the trip, the couple were able to spend some quality time together before Joe’s excursion to the Southern Hemisphere. Earlier this month, the pair enjoyed a romantic getaway to a private island in the Maldives, and then followed up the vacation with a huge celebration in New York City for Sophie’s 22nd birthday on Feb. 21. Joe’s brother Nick Jonas even commemorated the occasion by giving a sweet shout-out to the birthday girl. He shared a photo from Sophie and Joe’s engagement party in Nov. 2017, and captioned the pic that also included Kevin and Frankie Jonas, “Happy Birthday @sophiet You’re super cool! We all think so!” Aww, it’s like she’s already part of the family!  You can also bet that the Game Of Thrones star wouldn’t mind her fiancé posing for photos with a bunch of beauties on the beach. On her birthday, Sophie posted a video to her Instagram story jamming out to “22” by Taylor Swift (as any self-respecting 22-year-old would do on their birthday). As you may remember, Tay and Joe used to be a ~thing~ back in 2008. But clearly, that doesn’t phase the X-Men: Apocalypse star in the slightest — nor should it. Taylor has her own Joe (Alwyn) now, and the Josie star has made it clear there’s no bad blood between them. She even came to the singer’s defense when people on Twitter questioned her inclusion in TIME‘s Person of the Year issue in December. Basically Sophie is the best, and we’re sure Joe knows that!  HollywoodLifers, are you sad that Sophie isn’t in Australia with Joe?","Joe Jonas enjoyed some sunshine in Australia along with a group of female companions, though Sophie Turner was notably absent.

Prior to his trip, the couple had spent quality time together on a secluded island in the Maldives and celebrated Sophie's 22nd birthday in New York City on February 21. Joe's brother, Nick Jonas, even expressed his fondness for Sophie on social media, proving her warmth and acceptance within the family. It is evident that Sophie Turner has no issue with Joe being photographed with other women, as evidenced by her birthday video tribute on Instagram.

In a message on Instagram, he has elaborated on his reasons.  “I’ve learned the more you appreciate your calling the more you want to protect your calling,” he wrote. “Me taking this time right now is me saying I want to be SUSTAINABLE... so that I can be the man I want to be, the husband I eventually want to be, and the father I want to be.”  Perhaps referring to the string of fractious incidents he has been involved with, including punching a Spanish fan, driving drunk in a Lamborghini and being banned from China, he added: “Learning and growing hasn’t always been easy but knowing I’m not alone has kept me going. I have let my insecurities get the best of me at times, I let my broken relationships dictate the way I acted toward people and the way I treated them. I let bitterness, jealousy and fear run my life.!!!! ... What I’m not gonna do is be ashamed of my mistakes. I wanna be a man that learns from them and grows from them.!!”  He signed off by apologising for any grammatical errors: “I THINK THERES SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT IMPERFECTIONS!!”  With the tour now finished, the statement closes a chapter of his career.

Guardian Service","Justin Bieber has taken the time to provide his fans with an explanation for the cancellation of the remaining shows on his Purpose World Tour. In a heartfelt message shared on Instagram, the renowned artist expressed his desire for his mind, heart, and soul to thrive in a sustainable manner. Following an impressive run of 150 performances in 40 different countries, Bieber made the decision to cancel the final 14 shows, with the intention of taking a break and finding relaxation. 

Bieber acknowledges that his commitment to his calling has given him a newfound appreciation for its protection. By taking this time for himself, he aims to ensure his own sustainability, which will allow him to become the person, husband, and eventually the father he aspires to be. He offers insight into the challenges he has faced, referencing previous incidents such as altercations with fans, driving under the influence, and being barred from China. Despite these difficulties, Bieber finds solace in the knowledge that he is not alone in his journey of growth and learning. Reflecting on his shortcomings, he discloses how insecurity, broken relationships, and negative emotions have impacted his actions and decisions. Yet, he refuses to be burdened by shame and instead strives to evolve as a person, using his mistakes as valuable lessons.

Closing his message with an apology for any grammatical errors, Bieber emphasizes that he finds beauty in imperfections and believes they hold a special significance. With the conclusion of the Purpose World Tour, there is a sense of closure on this chapter of his career. Notably, the album Purpose and its hit singles, such as ""What Do You Mean,"" ""Love Yourself,"" and ""Sorry,"" achieved remarkable success, with ""Sorry"" recently relinquishing its title as the most streamed song globally to Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee’s ""Despacito,"" featuring Bieber as well.

While “normal” people are pressured by friends and family to get pregnant, celebrities are pressured by the whole world. And compared to other celebs, nobody has been more publicly pressured than Jennifer Aniston. The world is obsessed with her having a baby!  MORE: JENNIFER ANISTON’S AND JUSTIN THEROUX’S DOG CUSTODY BATTLE  It seems like no one has been reported pregnant more times than Jen.The earliest reports date back to 1999, back when the world first fell in love with her on Friends and she began dating Brad Pitt. Since 1999 there have been more than 55 published articles about her being pregnant both in and outside the U.S. It was even reported by the Huffington Post that despite the possibility that the U.S would go into war “Jennifer Aniston Pregnant” was still searched more than “are we at war” on Google.  Jennifer did express in early interviews that she wanted to become a mother one day and from then on the world was waiting. The obsession with her character on Friends—and the fact that Rachel did get pregnant—could be the reason why fans kept a close eye on is she or isn’t she in real life. In fact, the roles Jennifer took on in her career often had a direct impact on when and how her pregnancy rumors evolved.  Over time the extremity of the rumors changed, but many of the triggers are the same. Rumors start any time she is wearing a loose shirt or looks “bloated,” whenever she is in a new relationship, and whenever that relationship ends. And most importantly, the rumors evolve as she ages.  MORE: JENNIFER ANISTON BANS THE WORD “BABY” AROUND HER  Take a look at almost two decades worth of pregnancy rumors and how they progressed:","Not all women desire to have children, and this personal choice should be respected. While individuals within the ""normal"" population may face pressure from friends and family to start a family, celebrities often experience pressure on a global scale. Jennifer Aniston, in particular, has been subjected to intense public scrutiny regarding her decision to have children. 

The world's fascination with Aniston becoming a mother is evident. Numerous reports of her alleged pregnancies have circulated since as early as 1999 when she first rose to fame on the television show Friends and began a relationship with Brad Pitt. Over the years, more than 55 published articles mentioning her potential pregnancy have emerged globally. In fact, the online search interest for ""Jennifer Aniston Pregnant"" was even higher than the search interest for ""are we at war"" during a time when the possibility of a war loomed. 

The public's curiosity regarding Aniston's motherhood aspirations can be traced back to her early career and her portrayal of the character Rachel on Friends, who became a mother on the show. This, perhaps, fueled fans' interest in whether she would mirror her character's journey in real life. Furthermore, the roles Aniston took on in her professional endeavors often influenced the evolution of pregnancy rumors. 

Although the intensity of these rumors has varied over time, common triggers remain constant. Speculations arise whenever she wears loose clothing or appears bloated, during new relationships, and following the end of those relationships. Additionally, the progression of these rumors is closely linked to Aniston's age. 

In summary, Jennifer Aniston has been subjected to relentless speculation and pressure regarding her potential motherhood over the course of nearly two decades. This pervasive obsession with her personal life serves as a reminder that individuals, regardless of their celebrity status, deserve the right to make their own choices regarding starting a family."

However, notable figures in the entertainment industry took to Twitter to express their strong reactions towards the speech. A wide range of emotions ranging from anger to ridicule, skepticism, and sarcasm pervaded the responses of most celebrities. For instance, Josh Gad sarcastically likened the live broadcast of the State of the Union to an audacious, extended screening of the 'Purge' movie franchise on network television. 

Late-night comedians, such as Jimmy Kimmel, used the occasion to incorporate humor into their responses. Kimmel had Stormy Daniels, the adult film star who reportedly received payment to maintain silence about her alleged affair with Trump, as a guest on his show 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' Stephen Colbert, another late-night host, also employed his Twitter feed during the speech to comment cynically. He predicted that Trump would likely assert that his State of the Union address had a more significant turnout than Obama's.

Nevertheless, some celebrities voiced praise for Trump's speech. Conservative commentator Ann Coulter commended Trump's delivery, describing it as 'beautiful'. Chuck Woolery expressed appreciation for the speech's message of renewed optimism and prosperity for all Americans, emphasizing its inclusivity regardless of factors such as race, creed, or religion.

On the contrary, certain celebrities, like Elizabeth Banks, admitted they did not manage to endure the entirety of the speech due to perceived misinformation and unanswered questions. Banks chose to switch to listening to Tom Petty instead. Similarly, Questlove Gomez expressed uncertainty about whether the address had concluded.

A few celebrities decided not to watch at all. Chance the Rapper urged his followers to retweet his message if they were not tuning into the State of the Union. 

The reactions on Twitter were varied, with several notable figures sharing their opinions. Social activist and actress Ashley Judd used the platform to outline her vision for America, emphasizing the value of inclusivity regardless of religious beliefs, race, or country of origin. Jeffrey Wright expressed his deep aversion to Trump and his supporters, referring to them as a ""bizarre cult of self-interested sycophants."" Mark Ruffalo called for a focus on job creation and the needs of working people, rather than the interests of Wall Street.

These responses exemplify the diverse range of opinions and emotions elicited by President Trump's State of the Union address, showcasing the intense and polarizing nature of contemporary political discourse."

gossipcop-5077951266,1,1,"The royal wedding is a multi-million dollar affair. Chris Jackson / Getty  The average cost of a wedding for couples in the US and the UK is around $34,000 (£23,700).  Five figures is a huge expense for a one-day affair. That is, unless you're ultra-rich — and especially if you're royalty rich.  Next month, the world will bear witness to the most anticipated royal wedding in years. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are set to be married on May 19 at St. George's Chapel, in Windsor, and will begin a carriage procession immediately after the ceremony. Their reception will take place later on the grounds of Windsor Castle.  Kensington Palace will cover the cost of the wedding, an expense traditionally taken on by the bride's family.  The case was the same for Kate Middleton and Prince William's 2011 royal wedding— the only item Middleton paid for was her six-figure Alexander McQueen dress. Their total wedding celebration cost $34 million (£23.7 million).  Markle and Prince Harry's wedding will reportedly cost in excess of $45.8 million (£32 million), according to Bride Book's estimation. That's over 1,000 more than the average wedding.  The venue is the biggest part of a typical wedding budget for couples in the US and the UK, taking up nearly half of the entire wedding cost. Access to St. George's Chapel — and St. George's Great Hall, where the wedding reception will take place — is free of charge for Markle and Prince Harry. Transportation is also free, thanks to the Queen's fleet of Rolls-Royces, Daimlers, and Bentleys.  The greatest cost for the royal couple? Security. Protecting Markle and Prince Harry, plus thousands of guests and onlookers, will run Kensington Palace a whopping $43 million (£30 million), estimates Bride Book. That includes the cost of snipers, undercover police, military technology, and security drones. The bulk of Kate Middleton and Prince William's wedding budget similarly went to security costs.  Otherwise, Markle and Prince Harry's total wedding spend, including food, cakes, entertainment, wardrobe, and the honeymoon, amounts to about $2.8 million.  Below, check out Bride Book's breakdown of what the royal wedding will cost.","The upcoming royal wedding of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry on May 19th at St. George's Chapel in Windsor is garnering worldwide anticipation. While the average cost of a wedding for couples in the US and UK is around $34,000, this royal affair is expected to surpass that figure significantly. Kensington Palace will cover the expenses, a departure from the traditional practice of the bride's family bearing the cost.

The venue itself holds no charge for Markle and Prince Harry, as they have access to St. George's Chapel and St. George's Great Hall for their reception. Transportation is also taken care of, courtesy of the Queen's fleet of Rolls-Royces, Daimlers, and Bentleys. However, the largest part of the budget will be allocated towards security, estimated to be an impressive $43 million. This significant expenditure includes the implementation of snipers, undercover police, military technology, and security drones to ensure the safety of Markle, Prince Harry, their guests, and the thousands of onlookers.

Compared to the average wedding, Markle and Prince Harry's total spending on other aspects, such as food, cakes, entertainment, wardrobe, and the honeymoon, amounts to approximately $2.8 million. It should be noted that the most expensive item for the bride is her six-figure Alexander McQueen dress.

This highly-anticipated event is expected to cost over $45.8 million, according to Bride Book's estimation, which is more than 1,000 times the average wedding cost. Similar to Kate Middleton and Prince William's wedding in 2011, Kensington Palace will bear the majority of the expenses, highlighting the distinction and privilege of royal weddings.

As the world eagerly awaits this grand celebration, it is clear that the royal wedding of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry will be an extraordinary event, showcasing the opulence and meticulous planning associated with such occasions."
gossipcop-9362271023,1,0,"(Video provided by Splash News)  The Weeknd instigated his breakup with Selena Gomez, Gossip Cop can confirm. Gomez’s rekindled friendship with Justin Bieber, however, had nothing to do with the rapper’s decision to end his romance with the singer.  As Gossip Cop reported, Gomez and The Weeknd recently split after nearly a year of dating. The pair weren’t seen together much during the summer, though it was later revealed the singer-actress was laying low due to a kidney transplant. Regardless, they still appeared to be going strong in the early fall. Prior to the announcement of their breakup, the status of their relationship was questioned after it emerged Gomez had rekindled her friendship with Bieber. © Gossip Cop (Getty Images)  On Sunday, that speculation swirled as Bieber and Gomez were seen in public and The Weeknd stopped following her friends on social media. That being said, Bieber was allegedly not responsible for the breakup. Rather, it was the challenges of a long-distance relationship, particularly with The Weeknd touring and Gomez’s shooting schedule, that led both the former couple to reconsider their fizzling relationship.  Additionally, contributing to their split, the rapper felt “tied down” in a relationship that had lost its spark. Over time, the pair started talking less frequently on the phone, prompting The Weeknd to end his romance with Gomez, reports TMZ. Despite their breakup, we’re told that the pair are still on good terms and have talked several times since the split.  Predictably, after the rapper ended his relationship with Gomez, Gossip Cop busted the often disproven HollywoodLife for claiming in a made-up report that The Weeknd was “heartbroken” over Gomez reconnecting with Bieber. In the bogus story, the bad blog ridiculously asserted that The Weeknd and Gomez were caught in a “love triangle” with Bieber, but of course, the breakup had nothing to do with and wasn’t caused by the “Love Yourself” singer.  Related slideshow: Meghan Markle hit with baby talk and more tabloid tales debunked","According to Gossip Cop, The Weeknd initiated the breakup with Selena Gomez, and it was unrelated to Gomez's renewed friendship with Justin Bieber. After nearly a year of dating, Gomez and The Weeknd recently ended their relationship. Their lack of public appearances during the summer was explained by Gomez's need to recover from a kidney transplant. However, it seemed that they were still going strong in the early fall. Speculation surrounding their relationship status heightened when Bieber and Gomez were seen together in public on Sunday, and The Weeknd stopped following Gomez's friends on social media. Nevertheless, Bieber was reportedly not the cause of the breakup. The challenges of maintaining a long-distance relationship, with The Weeknd touring and Gomez having a busy shooting schedule, led both of them to reassess their fading romance. Additionally, the rapper felt constrained in a relationship that had lost its spark. Their communication dwindled over time, prompting The Weeknd to end things with Gomez. Despite the breakup, they are said to still be on good terms and have had multiple conversations since parting ways. Gossip Cop discredited a report from HollywoodLife that claimed The Weeknd was heartbroken over Gomez reconnecting with Bieber, as it was baseless. The breakup had no involvement with Bieber and was not caused by him."

Just eerie stuff.”  PHOTOS: Nicole Kidman & Keith Urban Hit The Beach Amid Rumored Marriage Trouble  The hair-raising account follows reports that country crooner Keith, 50, is considering shelling out $39 million for the Upper East Side townhouse that the King of Pop once called home.  The couple — parents of daughters Sunday Rose, 9, and Faith Margaret, 6 — already own homes in Beverly Hills, Australia and Nashville.  Sources said Keith wanted to gift Nicole, also 50, with a lavish Big Apple base while she broadens her already glittering career.  “Nicole is keen to do Broadway shows and get into making more TV programs, and New York is a better place for them to be than Nashville,” said a source.  PHOTOS: Report: Dark Past Revealed — Keith Urban’s Former Drug Dealer Tells All  But according to insiders, ghostly goings-on abound at the six-story, 16-room home!  The incidents include strange scraping noises, lights flickering, shadows in odd places and weird temperature swings — “dead spots” where visitors suddenly feel a burst of cold.  “Michael was a troubled man, and troubled people sometimes wear out their welcome in the homes they occupied,” said the insider.

Email us at tips@radaronline.com, or call us at 800-344-9598 any time, day or night.","Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban's New York City residence is said to have an intriguing history, as our exclusive sources reveal that it was formerly owned by the late Michael Jackson. While some suggest that the King of Pop may still linger within the walls, it is important to approach such claims with an open mind.
 
Witnesses have described the occurrences as subtle and hard-to-detect, as is often the case with paranormal phenomena. Mysterious sounds, flickering lights, unusual shadows, and sudden changes in temperature have been reported by visitors to the six-story, 16-room townhouse. Some have even experienced what can only be described as localized ""cold spots"" that momentarily bring a chill to the air.

Given Michael Jackson's complex life and the challenges he faced, it is perhaps not uncommon for remnants of his energy to remain in the places he once occupied. Despite these reports, it is important to note that there is no evidence of any overt supernatural activity, such as hearing the famous artist singing or witnessing him perform his iconic moonwalk.

Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban, renowned figures in the entertainment industry and parents to two beautiful daughters, have expressed a desire to establish a home in the vibrant city of New York. This move aligns with Nicole's aspirations to expand her already illustrious career by pursuing opportunities in Broadway shows and television productions. Furthermore, it provides a convenient base for the couple as they continue to maintain residences in other prominent locations such as Beverly Hills, Australia, and Nashville.

As with any haunted tales, skepticism is natural. However, the claims about Michael Jackson's lingering presence in this historic mansion add a layer of intrigue to Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban's acquisition. Whether there is any truth to these accounts or merely a reflection of the human tendency to seek connections with the past, the allure of this New York dream home remains resolute."

gossipcop-3564164651,1,0,"Caitlyn Jenner is having weird sense of joy these days! Says Cellulite makes her feel more feminine!  Caitlyn Jenner, the TV personality, and a former Olympic gold medal-winning decathlon champion is having a different sense of the quality of expressing her womanhood. She says that the cellulite in her thighs, hips, and tummy is giving her different sense of joy and can’t wait to show it off.  A weird article  The headline “Cellulite Makes Cait Feel So Womanly!” from the National Enquirer/RadarOnline is trending these days. And do you want to know what the article says? You must have some info about this! It said:  Caitlyn Jenner is telling friends she can’t wait to wear a bikini this summer to show off some skin, and her recently acquired cellulite!  That seems really weird, doesn’t it? I mean showing it off in a bikini for what? After all, many people try to hide their cellulite and here Jenner is going to a different path. She is WAITING for the summer just to show it off! Just to remind you, the article also called her a “blabbermouth”. And I don’t think it could be wrong. She blabbering about things that makes no sense. Maybe her excessive talking needed a halt and this quoted name of her may stop her from talking much now. Let’s see what the article had to say other than that. It said:  She has this weird sense of joy when she sees patches of cellulite on her thighs, hips and tummy. The sight of lumpy flesh doesn’t upset her. It makes her feel more feminine!  Maybe Caitlyn is trying to respect her body by respecting what she has. You can’t just disrespect your body for having a lumpy flesh. It is your body after all and if you disrespect it by yourself and obviously you can’t expect respect from others, can you? And who knows, maybe that lumpy dimpled flesh will look really feminine on her. It is creating a buzz in the media as this is not what you hear from a TV personality everyday. After all, every ordinary people might have cellulite in their body. It also said that Jenner’s view: “dimpled feminine flesh as a rite of passage into true womanhood.” and it was also reported that she wouldn’t mind having more cellulite in her body in future. The story features a zoomed-in photo of purported cellulite on Jenner’s leg. Also, after all these years of being a decathlete and going through dieting for years, the 67 year old Jenner might not want to do it anymore. “So let it be!” is what she might have been thinking. Also, the other reason maybe her daughter Kim’s cellulite pictures that surfaced online. This might just be a way to support her daughter.  Rumors or truth  This is not the only time some issues or sites posted a rumor about Caitlyn Jenner. Just last year, a issue of National Enquirer said that Jenner “wants her BIG, clunky-feet reduced to more lady-like proportions.” Again, this just a few days ago, radar online was on about exploring her sexuality online and enjoying a number of secret ‘cyber hookups’. The transgender star, Jenner has had gender reassignment surgery as well as she said she was never interested in men. There are many rumors which may include some truth about Jenner.  Short Bio on Caitlyn Jenner  Caitlyn Jenner is a decathlete turned TV personality. She is known by her previous name “Bruce Jenner”. The Olympic gold medal winner came out as a transgender in April 2015. She is the celebrity from the reality show “Keeping Up with Kardashians” along with her daughters. She has undergone a knee surgery before which she was a college football player for the Graceland Yellowjackets. More Bio…","Caitlyn Jenner, the renowned TV personality and former Olympic gold medal-winning decathlon champion, has recently found a unique way of embracing her womanhood. In an article titled ""Cellulite Makes Cait Feel So Womanly!"", trending in the National Enquirer/RadarOnline, Jenner expresses her joy in the presence of cellulite on her thighs, hips, and tummy and eagerly anticipates the opportunity to show it off.

While this may seem unconventional to many, especially considering that most individuals try to conceal their cellulite, Jenner's perspective offers a fresh take on body acceptance. Rather than disdaining her body for its lumpy flesh, Jenner is choosing to honor and respect her physical form. By embracing her cellulite, she exemplifies the idea that self-respect is essential; if we do not respect our own bodies, we cannot expect respect from others.

Moreover, Jenner's decision to proudly display her dimpled flesh in a bikini this summer has garnered significant attention from the media. Given that cellulite is a common occurrence, even among ordinary individuals, such an open and positive attitude toward it is both refreshing and unusual, particularly from a well-known TV personality.

Interestingly, the article also notes that Jenner considers her cellulite as a rite of passage into true womanhood, emphasizing her belief that this physical attribute enhances her femininity. Additionally, it is reported that Jenner would not mind if she were to develop even more cellulite in the future. This stands in stark contrast to her past experiences as a decathlete, during which she endured rigorous dieting and fitness regimens.

Perhaps this shift in mindset can be attributed in part to Jenner's desire to support her daughter, Kim, who has also faced public scrutiny regarding her own cellulite. Alternatively, it may simply reflect Jenner's personal journey of self-acceptance and self-expression.

While various rumors and speculations have surrounded Caitlyn Jenner in the past, it is important to rely on accurate information when discussing her. Coming out as transgender in April 2015, Jenner has since undergone gender reassignment surgery and has been open about her disinterest in men. However, it is important not to confuse rumors with facts, as they may contain elements of truth alongside misinformation.

In summary, Caitlyn Jenner, formerly known as Bruce Jenner, is not just a decathlete and television personality but also a figure who challenges societal norms and expectations. By proudly embracing her cellulite, she exemplifies the importance of self-respect and body acceptance. As rumors continue to circulate, it is essential to rely on accurate information when discussing Jenner's life and experiences."
gossipcop-2116458,1,0,"MAY 02, 2017  RDR Staff  About prosopagnosia  About epidermolysis bullosa  Stay informed on the latest rare disease news and developments by signing up for our newsletter  In this week’s Hollywood gossip, it was revealed that Brad Pitt does not have a rare disease that is ‘eating him away.’Whew.However, the actor is no stranger to the rare disease community. Pitt is an honorary member of the Epidermolysis Bullosa Medical Research Foundation (EBMRF) that is dedicated to raising money and awareness for the rare skin disorder, epidermolysis bullosa.In January, Pitt introduced singer Chris Cornell during a Rock4EB annual charity to support EBMRF.Further, he revealed in a 2013 Esquire Magazine interview that he self-diagnosed himself with a rare disease – prosopagnosia — also known as face blindness. According to the article, ""Brad Pitt won't remember you. If you've met him, he'll have no idea who you are when he meets you again. Even if you've had what he calls ""a real conversation,"" your face will start fading from his memory as soon as you walk away.""It should be noted that being diagnosed with a condition and being self-diagnosed with a condition can be 2 very different diagnoses.Prosopagnosia refers to the inability to recognize familiar people from their face. They may also be unable to recognize other stimuli, such as objects, cars, or animals.People with prosopagnosia typically learn to use non-face cues including voice, walking style and hairstyle to recognize others. The underlying genetic cause of developmental prosopagnosia is not known but familial reports of this condition are consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance.Epidermolysis bullosa (aka 'the worst disease you've never heard of') is a group of devastating, life-threatening genetic skin disorders impacting children that is characterized by skin blisters and erosions all over the body.The most severe form, recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, is characterized by chronic skin blistering, open and painful wounds, joint contractures, esophageal strictures, pseudosyndactyly, corneal abrasions and a shortened life span. Patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa lack functional type VII collagen (C7) owing to mutations in the gene COL7A1 that encodes for C7 and is the main component of anchoring fibrils that attach the dermis to the epidermis.Epidermolysis bullosa patients suffer through intense pain throughout their lives, with no effective treatments available to reduce the severity of their symptoms.","Brad Pitt, a prominent figure in Hollywood, recently dispelled rumors of him suffering from a rare disease that was allegedly ""eating him away."" While this news may come as a relief to his fans, it is worth noting that Pitt has shown remarkable dedication to raising awareness and funds for those afflicted with rare diseases.

One such condition is Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB), a rare skin disorder. Pitt is an honorary member of the Epidermolysis Bullosa Medical Research Foundation (EBMRF), an organization committed to supporting individuals with this debilitating disorder. Earlier this year, Pitt made an appearance at the Rock4EB charity event, where he introduced singer Chris Cornell, in aid of the EBMRF.

Additionally, Pitt has openly discussed his own self-diagnosis with another rare condition known as prosopagnosia, also referred to as face blindness. In a 2013 interview with Esquire Magazine, he shared his struggles in recognizing familiar faces and how he often forgets people he has met before. It is important to acknowledge that self-diagnosis differs from a formal diagnosis, and certain nuances may be overlooked.

Prosopagnosia is a condition characterized by the inability to recognize familiar faces or stimuli, such as objects or animals. Those affected by this condition often rely on other cues, such as voice, walking style, and hairstyle, to identify individuals. The genetic cause of developmental prosopagnosia is not yet fully understood, but familial evidence suggests a possible autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.

In contrast, Epidermolysis Bullosa is a group of severe genetic skin disorders that primarily impact children. It results in painful skin blistering and erosion throughout the body. The most severe form, known as recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, involves chronic blistering, painful wounds, joint stiffness, and other complications. This condition arises due to a deficiency in type VII collagen (C7), caused by mutations in the COL7A1 gene.

Individuals with Epidermolysis Bullosa endure a lifetime of excruciating pain, with limited treatment options available to alleviate their symptoms. Medical researchers and organizations like the EBMRF strive to find effective solutions for those affected by this devastating disease.

Brad Pitt's involvement in raising awareness for these rare diseases highlights the importance of supporting individuals battling such conditions. His dedication to these causes serves as an inspiration to others, encouraging them to join the fight against these debilitating disorders and bring hope to those in need."

USA TODAY President Trump in Trump Tower. (Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP) Corrections & Clarifications: A previous version of the story included a tweet from a parody account claiming to Jill Biden. NEW YORK CITY – President Trump's argument Tuesday that left wing groups were just as violent as the white supremacists who staged a demonstration in Charlottesville set off a firestorm of criticism from members of his own party – and raised questions about his personal views of racial tensions in the country. Just one day after Trump sought to tamp down on controversy by condemning white supremacists for their role in racially motivated clashes in the Virginia city, the president appeared to return to his highly criticized initial response that many sides were to blame for the weekend violence. ""What about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, alt-right?"" Trump told reporters in a chaotic impromptu press conference at Trump Tower. ""Do they have any semblance of guilt? What about the fact they came charging with clubs in their hands?"" Trump said he couldn't make a condemnation of hate groups earlier because he didn't ""know all the facts"" about an alleged white nationalist who crashed a car into a crowd of protesters, killing one person and wounded 19 others. CLOSE From Trump Tower in New York City, President Trump told reporters that both sides were to blame for the violence that occurred in Charlottesville, Virginia. USA TODAY ""I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct,"" Trump said from Trump Tower in New York, after an event that was intended to be devoted to a new infrastructure executive order. Trump has been especially quick to denounce previous terrorist attacks, including those taking place overseas. Yet he was notably reticent to pinpoint the blame for one on Saturday that involved white supremacists – a point his critics on both sides of the aisle continued to hammer. ""We must be clear. White supremacy is repulsive. This bigotry is counter to all this country stands for. There can be no moral ambiguity,” said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. added: ""There is only one side to be on when a white supremacist mob brutalizes and murders in America.” Several lawmakers were dismayed the president appeared to equate white supremacists with their opponents. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., tweeted: ""Blaming 'both sides' for #Charlottesville?! No. Back to relativism when dealing with KKK, Nazi sympathizers, white supremacists? Just no."" Another Republican, Rep. Charlie Dent from Pennsylvania, said Trump ""must stop the moral equivalency! AGAIN."" Over the weekend, Trump faced heavy criticism from both Republicans and Democrats for chiding ""many sides"" for their role in the violence in Charlottesville on Saturday, a statement many regarded as tepid toward racists. A full two days later, on Monday, Trump at the White House directly condemned the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists and announced the Justice Department would open up a civil rights investigation into the driver of the car that killed Charlottesville resident Heather Heyer. Yet on Tuesday, amid questions about whether Trump meant the words behind his most recent scripted statement, the president called his initial response ""fine"" and blamed the press for being dishonest in its coverage. ""There was no way of making a correct statement that early,"" he said at one point. ""I had to see the facts. Unlike a lot of reporters – I didn't know (prominent white supremacist) David Duke was there. I wanted to see the facts."" For his part, former KKK leader Duke tweeted a thank you to the president after his statement Tuesday – for condemning ""the leftist terrorists"" in Black Lives Matter and Antifa.","President Trump addressed the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia from Trump Tower in New York City, expressing his belief that both protesters and counter protesters shared responsibility. His comments caused widespread criticism from members of his party and raised concerns about his stance on racial tensions in the country. Despite condemning white supremacists the day before, Trump seemed to backtrack and claim that multiple sides were to blame for the violence. He questioned whether the ""alt-left"" should also be held accountable for their violent actions. Trump explained that he couldn't immediately condemn hate groups because he did not have all the facts regarding the car incident that resulted in one death and multiple injuries. Trump emphasized that unlike most politicians, he wanted to ensure his statements were accurate. However, his delayed and ambiguous response drew heavy criticism from both Democrats and Republicans, who denounced white supremacy and urged for a clear condemnation of the violence. Lawmakers expressed dismay at Trump's suggestion of equivalence between white supremacists and their opponents. In response to the backlash, Trump defended his decision to delay his initial response, blaming the press for being dishonest and stating that he needed to gather all the facts. Former KKK leader David Duke thanked the president for condemning what he referred to as ""leftist terrorists"" in groups like Black Lives Matter and Antifa. Trump faced further criticism when he claimed that not all attendees of the demonstration were racist or neo-Nazis, arguing that some were simply protesting the removal of the Robert E. Lee statue. Republicans rejected this notion, asserting that those who attended a Klan rally were likely racist or bigoted. Senator Marco Rubio highlighted the danger of an ideology that promotes hatred and justifies violence against people based on race or ethnicity. Rubio urged Trump not to assign only 50% of the blame to white supremacists, as it would give them a sense of victory. The president's impromptu press conference, originally intended to focus on infrastructure, revolved mainly around Charlottesville. Trump expressed skepticism towards the removal of Confederate statues and monuments by local governments, questioning whether tributes to George Washington and Thomas Jefferson would also be at risk due to their slave ownership. Despite these comments, Trump acknowledged that local authorities had the freedom to make decisions on these matters."

Nick and Mariah’s twins – son Morocco and daughter Monroe, 6 – will be featured in his wedding, and sources say Mariah’s thinking of asking Nick to walk her down the aisle. “[He] will always be a big part of her life,” the source added. Considering Mariah, Nick and the twins recently made an adorable appearance at the 2018 Kids’ Choice Awards, it makes total sense that Mariah’s ex would be on hand to see her say “I Do” again.","Mariah Carey, the renowned singer, has reportedly taken a significant step in her relationship with Bryan Tanaka, leading to speculations of an impending wedding. According to sources, Mariah, aged 47, expressed her love for Bryan, 34, through an unconventional proposal.

This heartfelt gesture was followed by Mariah expressing her readiness to formalize their relationship. Bryan, overwhelmed by this extraordinary moment, responded with an enthusiastic ""yes"" to Mariah's proposal.

Evidently, Bryan shares Mariah's sentiment and envisions a future together. The couple wasted no time in starting their wedding preparations, disregarding the notion of waiting for the perfect moment. Mariah has expressed a preference for holding the ceremony at the Grand Wailea Resort in Maui, a place of sentimental significance as it marks the start of their publicized romance. Additionally, the idea of a winter-themed wedding, considering Mariah's association with Christmas, has piqued her interest.

Taking into account Mariah's previous marital experiences with Tommy Mottola and Nick Cannon, both ending in heartbreak, Mariah is being prudent in safeguarding her substantial fortune. To ensure a secure future, she is reportedly in the process of creating a prenuptial agreement, leaving nothing to chance.

Interestingly, Nick Cannon, Mariah's ex-husband and father to their twins, Morocco and Monroe, is expected to play an important role in the upcoming wedding.

There was no truth to that claim, and the same goes for this latest one.","Tobey Maguire's alleged pursuit of Emma Stone and obtaining her phone number at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles is nothing more than a fabricated tabloid report, according to Gossip Cop. Our exclusive investigation reveals that this incident never took place. 

Life & Style magazine claims that Maguire recently spotted Stone at the famed Hollywood hotel and engaged in observing her attentively, hoping for her acknowledgment. The publication's questionable source suggests that the actor eventually approached Stone and proceeded to shower her with insincere compliments, emphasizing the adoration she receives from the entire entertainment industry. 

Supposedly, Stone exhibited disinterest towards Maguire's advancements but eventually relented, providing him with her contact information and suggesting a coffee meeting, before swiftly departing. The alleged insider insinuates that Stone's actions made it apparent that she was dismissive of Maguire's attempts. 

However, Gossip Cop, in direct communication with a reliable source close to Maguire, found the entire narrative presented by the tabloid to be fabricated and baseless. Our source confirms that these events simply did not occur. Regrettably, it comes as no surprise that Life & Style would publish such a fictitious story. In the past, Gossip Cop had already debunked the outlet's false claim of Eva Mendes experiencing jealousy over Stone's friendship with Ryan Gosling. Both stories lack credibility and should be dismissed."

gossipcop-3308884181,1,1,"Beyoncé Rumored To Be Asking For Silent Delivery  As the countdown to Blueprint 1 and Blueprint 2’s arrival continues, the stories about Bey’s birth plans abound. First, we heard she planned to give birth at home, then they said her security has been running weekly drills to practice their approach to Cedars-Sinai and now there’s a report that Bey wants silence in the delivery room.  According to Naughty Gossip reports:  “Beyoncé likes peace and calm around her. She has zero time for drama and gossip. She likes her inner circle to be soft spoken if they have to talk at all. And you can expect the same will be true when she gives birth to the twins,” sources tell Straight Shuter. “You can only get into her private life if you are invited. She is very guarded and protects her privacy at all cost. She likes to be surrounded with peaceful colors and soft sounds. This will be of utmost importance for her when giving birth.”  This story is almost like opening up a fortune cookie or visiting your average storefront psychic. EVERYBODY knows Beyoncé is private. THAT doesn’t take an exclusive source to figure out.  Silent birth is a real thing though – something that Scientologists practice and Katie Holmes even did when she gave birth to Suri, but as much as Bey loves music we don’t really see her doing a silent birth.  Speaking of Bey’s love of music… Hit the flip for some recently posted pics of her from a Michael Jackson/Prince party.  GettyImages/Instagram","Rumors Circulate that Beyoncé Plans for a Silent Delivery

With the imminent arrival of Blueprint 1 and Blueprint 2, speculations surrounding Beyoncé's birth plans have been increasing. Initially, there were reports of her intention to give birth at home, followed by claims that her security team has been meticulously preparing for their approach to Cedars-Sinai. Recently, a new report has emerged, stating that Beyoncé wishes for silence in the delivery room.

According to reliable sources from Naughty Gossip, ""Beyoncé values peace and tranquility in her surroundings. She actively avoids unnecessary drama and gossip. When it comes to communication within her inner circle, she prefers soft-spoken individuals or no talking at all. It is only through invitation that others may enter her private life. She is extremely protective of her privacy and prioritizes a serene environment, characterized by peaceful colors and gentle sounds, even during childbirth.""

While it is commonly known that Beyoncé is a private individual, these revelations regarding her birthing preferences are reminiscent of opening up a fortune cookie or visiting an average storefront psychic. Furthermore, the concept of silent birth, although practiced by some Scientologists and even by Katie Holmes during her delivery of Suri, does not seem to align with Beyoncé's deep affinity for music.

Speaking of her love for music, we invite you to view some recently posted images of Beyoncé, captured during a Michael Jackson/Prince themed party, by flipping through the slideshow provided by GettyImages/Instagram."

Jenner, 67, completed gender reassignment surgery in January, according to her new memoir, ‘The Secrets of My Life’. The photo shoot promises to be Caitlyn's finest hour since she first announced her transition in an interview with ABC’s Diane Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July.  Although the Kardashian-Jenner clan is said to be ‘wholly supportive’ of Jenner’s transition, sources close to the family say the prospect of a nude shoot is ‘their worst nightmare’.  Caitlyn Jenner, 67, completed gender reassignment surgery in January, according her memoir, ‘The Secrets of My Life’. The photo shoot promises to be Caitlyn's finest hour since she first announced her transition in an interview with ABC’s Diane Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July  Although the Kardashian-Jenner clan is said to be ‘wholly supportive’ of Jenner’s transition, sources close to the family say the prospect of a nude shoot is ‘their worst nightmare’  An insider tells DailyMail.com that the Kardashians learned of the 67-year-old’s plan from her model son Brody, 33.  ‘Brody told them that Caitlyn has planned and booked a full nude photo shoot and they were like, that’s unacceptable, it’s taking things too far,' the source said.  ‘They’re hoping the shoot doesn't come to pass because that would be their worst nightmare. Taking it to that level and unveiling her [new body] with a fully naked photo spread is going way too far.'  Kardashian momager Kris, who is said to have known about Jenner’s surgery in advance, has vowed to stop the shoot from going ahead, according to the insider.  ‘She knew the surgery was inevitable and it was bound to happen,’ said the source. ‘But she says she will do everything in her power to stop the shoot if she can.'  DailyMail.com has approached representatives for Jenner and the Kardashians for comment. Jenner's rep knew nothing about it.  Jenner first announced her transition in an interview with Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July.  The headline-making ‘I am Cait’ shoot was said to have taken the Kardashian clan by surprise at the time and led to tension between Jenner and Kim, 36, as a result.  Nevertheless, the family have been publicly supportive of her decision to transition, which was completed in January according leaked extracts from her memoir.  Jenner wrote of the $20,000 operation: 'The surgery was a success, and I feel not only wonderful but liberated […] I am going to live authentically for the first time in my life.  ‘I am going to have an enthusiasm for life that I have not had in 39 years since the Olympics, almost two thirds of my life.'  But the book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife and step-children.  Sources close to the family told DailyMail.com that Jenner’s ‘unpredictable’ behavior has also played a part in their current estrangement.  The insider said: ‘[The book] is definitely something that she’s wanted to do for a while and it was just a matter of time before she got it done.  ‘But the family were like, it’s probably going to reopen the drama of everything [that has happened].  ‘They were worried because she’s been so unpredictable lately and just trying to get out into the limelight.’  Jenner's book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife  A second leaked extract from the memoir has already proven embarrassing, after Jenner claimed the late Robert Kardashian knew O.J. Simpson was guilty of the murder of his wife Nicole Brown and her friend Ron Goldman.  Kardashian, the father of Kourtney, Khloe, Kim and their brother Rob, was part of Simpson’s defense team during his 1","Caitlyn Jenner, at the age of 67, has recently undergone gender reassignment surgery in January, as detailed in her memoir 'The Secrets of My Life.' In an effort to highlight her journey, Jenner has planned a nude photo shoot, which is anticipated to be a defining moment since her transition was publicly announced in an interview with ABC's Diane Sawyer in April 2015, followed by a stunning appearance in Vanity Fair. Although the Kardashian-Jenner family is said to be fully supportive of Jenner's transition, sources close to the family reveal that a nude shoot represents their worst nightmare. A reliable insider has disclosed that the Kardashian-Jenner clan became aware of this plan through Jenner's son, Brody. The family views this as an excessive and unnecessary step. Kris Jenner, who reportedly had prior knowledge of Jenner's surgery, has pledged to prevent the photo shoot from taking place. Communications have been initiated with both Jenner's and the Kardashian family's representatives for further comments on the matter. It's worth noting that Jenner's previous appearance in Vanity Fair, known as the 'I am Cait' shoot, caused tension within the family at the time, particularly between Jenner and Kim Kardashian. However, despite internal conflicts, the family has publicly voiced their support for Jenner's decision to transition, which was ultimately completed in January. Jenner herself expressed her satisfaction with the surgery, stating, 'The surgery was a success, and I feel not only wonderful but liberated. I am going to live authentically for the first time in my life.' Unfortunately, these recent developments have strained Jenner's relationship with her former spouse and step-children. The memoir, composed with the assistance of journalist Buzz Bissinger, has intensified the discord and magnified Jenner's unpredictable behavior, causing further estrangement with her family. It is clear that the memoir was a long-desired project for Jenner, and the family was apprehensive about the potential reopening of past conflicts. Given Jenner's recent unpredictable behavior and her desire for attention, the family has been wary throughout this process. Additionally, an embarrassing revelation emerged from another leaked extract of the memoir, wherein Jenner claimed that the late Robert Kardashian knew of O.J. Simpson's guilt in the murder of Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman. Kardashian, who was the father of Kourtney, Khloe, Kim, and Rob Kardashian, was a member of Simpson's defense team during his highly publicized trial."
gossipcop-6742180407,1,0,"It was a humid 84 degrees in Bridgehampton on Saturday, but that didn’t stop a crowd of people from descending upon Topping Rose House for Jill Zarin’s annual luncheon. The former Real Housewife of New York, ran around the grounds in an A-line Carolina Herrera dress, posing on the step-and-repeat, taking photos with fans, and catching up with old friends. Trying to track her down for an interview turned into a scavenger hunt.  Scattered around the lawn were tables for vendors selling everything from wine to sex toys. There was a station for guests to get a vitamin infusion, with seats in the direct line of the sun transforming the spot into an inescapable sauna-I.V. drip hybrid. Housewives from across the country flew into town for the occasion (Vicki Gunvalson of Orange County and LeeAnne Locken of Dallas), which also served as a benefit for Thyroid Cancer Research in honor of Zarin’s late husband, Bobby, who died of the disease in January.  Upon first try to flag Zarin down for a couple of questions, she sent over her daughter, Ally Shapiro, in her stead. Shapiro reflected on last year’s luncheon, when her stepfather was still struggling with cancer, but encouraged her and her mother to party on.  “He loved drinking and partying. This was the highlight of his year,” she said. “It was this time last year that we were told he wasn’t gonna make it another week, and he pushed us and he said, ‘Go to the party. Maybe I won’t be here when you come back, but go.’”  Shapiro, who now lives in London while she works on her master’s degree, admits that she can’t watch old episodes of Real Housewives, which showed her as 14-year-old struggling to get close to her stepfather. “You want to think that it’s like a home movie, but it’s not. That’s not what our relationship was like,” she said, adding that the reruns play constantly in the U.K. “I’m walking down the street and someone’s like, ‘Oh my God, I just saw you trying on a prom dress!’”  She also said that her mother is dabbling with dating, specifically with a man she plays tennis with. “It’s fun, and I live in London so it’s good for her to have a distraction.”  Dina Lohan, dressed in a metallic green blazer and shorts set and a pair of oversized aviators, arrived fashionably late to the affair, but was immediately greeted by hoards of people trying to chat her up or get a photo. Eventually secured in the same spot for more than a few seconds, she was willing to talk about her daughter Lindsay’s upcoming project for MTV, a Vanderpump Rules–inspired reality show that follows Lindsay and the employees of her new Lohan Beach Club. Bunim/Murray Productions is producing the series, the same company that produced Lohan’s E! reality show Living Lohan a decade ago.  “These kids were like, babies, and now they’re running the show,” she said of the crew. “They lived in my house! And now they’re all corporate. . . . We’re home. It’s cyclical, you know.”  Lohan also revealed that the upcoming series is a bit of a family affair with Lindsay’s younger sister, 24-year-old Ali, providing the theme song.  A friend of Lohan’s interjected, asking if Ali, like her older sister over a decade ago, had moved out to L.A. for work.  “She’s in New York with me,” the matriarch answered. “I keep them close! I’m not going to lose someone to L.A., no. Not again!”  Finally, the woman of the hour managed to stop and take a breath. While Zarin may no longer be a Bravo housewife, she still knows how to schmooze like one. She’s been keeping up with the latest season of the show here and there, and even received a good-luck message from Luann de Lesseps, who checked into rehab earlier in the month, wishing her good luck on the event. Having brought me up to speed, Zarin closed our conversation with a plug for her new line of “pet-proof, gorgeous, and inexpensive” rugs, aptly titled Jill Zarin Rugs. Because once a housewife, always a housewife.  Get Vanity Fair’s Cocktail Hour Our essential brief on culture, the news, a","On Saturday, despite the humid weather, a numerous crowd gathered at Topping Rose House in Bridgehampton for Jill Zarin's annual luncheon. The former Real Housewife of New York, elegantly attired in a Carolina Herrera dress, graciously interacted with attendees. The pursuit of an interview with Zarin turned into quite the scavenger hunt. The event featured an array of vendors selling diverse items, ranging from wine to sex toys. Notably, a station provided guests with vitamin infusions, albeit under the direct exposure of the sun, turning the area into an unavoidable hybrid of a sauna and I.V. drip. Housewives from different parts of the country, including Vicki Gunvalson from Orange County and LeeAnne Locken from Dallas, flew in to attend the luncheon. The gathering also served as a benefit for Thyroid Cancer Research, paying tribute to Zarin's late husband, Bobby, who tragically succumbed to the illness in January.

Upon initial attempts to approach Zarin for an interview, she delegated her daughter, Ally Shapiro, to represent her. Shapiro shared her reflections on last year's luncheon, during which her stepfather battled cancer. Despite the circumstances, he encouraged them to attend the celebration, as he himself had cherished the joyous occasion. Shapiro, currently residing in London to pursue her master's degree, admitted her difficulty watching past episodes of Real Housewives, as they portray her struggles at the age of 14 to forge a connection with her stepfather. The reruns of the show are incessantly broadcasted in the U.K., leading to unexpected encounters with recognition from strangers. Shapiro also disclosed that her mother is venturing into the dating scene, specifically with a man she plays tennis with, providing a welcome distraction for her in London.

Dina Lohan, donned in a stylish metallic green blazer and shorts ensemble, arrived fashionably late to the luncheon, immediately attracting a crowd of people eager to engage in conversation or take a photo with her. Eventually finding a moment of respite, she candidly discussed Lindsay's upcoming MTV project, a reality show inspired by Vanderpump Rules, which will follow Lindsay and the employees of her new establishment, Lohan Beach Club. Interestingly, Bunim/Murray Productions, the same company that produced Lindsay's reality show on E! a decade ago, is producing this new series. Reflecting on the past, Lohan remarked on how the crew had grown from young individuals living in her house to now occupying corporate positions. She also shared that Lindsay's younger sister, Ali, has contributed the theme song for the show. When asked if Ali had also relocated to Los Angeles for work, Dina reassured that both of her daughters are together in New York, emphasizing her desire to keep her family close after previous experiences of separation.

Finally, amidst the festivities, Jill Zarin paused to catch her breath. Though no longer a Bravo housewife, she has not lost her ability to engage and socialize with others. Zarin has kept up with the current season of the show, receiving a supportive message from Luann de Lesseps, who recently entered rehab, expressing her well wishes for the event. Concluding our conversation, Zarin promoted her new line of rugs named ""Jill Zarin Rugs,"" which are not only pleasing to the eye, but also resistant to pet-related mishaps. It seems that once a housewife, always a housewife."

The 20-year-old cosmetics guru — who is expecting her first child, a baby girl, with boyfriend Travis Scott — did not appear in any photos from the bash shared to social media by KarJenner family members. But a source tells PEOPLE she was there celebrating away from the cameras.  “Kylie looked great but didn’t really draw any attention to her baby bump,” the source says. “She still acts like she wants to keep her pregnancy private.”  Meanwhile, her sister Khloé Kardashian, — who earlier this week confirmed that she and boyfriend Tristan Thompson are expecting their first child together — accentuated her own baby bump in a skin-tight, sparkly jumpsuit with a white fur coat.  “Khloé was beaming all night,” the insider says of the 33-year-old Revenge Body host. “She kept touching and showing off her cute baby belly.”  Khloé showed off her bump on Instagram as well.  “Merry Christmas!! May you sparkle and shine this festive season, may all of your wishes and dreams come true,” Khloé captioned a gallery of shots showing her touching her belly. “I pray that we all may feel this happiness all year round. God bless you! ✨ #BabyBump🤗”  “Merry Christmas!!!!!

Kourtney’s ex-boyfriend Scott Disick was there, too — without girlfriend Sofia Richie.  “He mingled, looked good and didn’t drink,” the source says, adding that there wasn’t any awkwardness with Kourtney’s new boyfriend Younes Bendjima.  “Kourtney seemed so happy that Younes joined her,” the insider says. “They are so cute together. He kept bringing her drinks and doting on her. Younes fits right into the family. He didn’t seem uncomfortable that Scott was there. They said hello, but that was it. It was very civil.”  Other guests included Kim’s husband Kanye West, celebrity hair stylists Jen Atkin and Chris Appleton, singer Christina Aguilera and Keeping Up with the Kardashians executive producer Ryan Seacrest. Kris appeared to be in a good mood throughout the night, dancing with Kim and Khloé and playing MC while Babyface, Toni Braxton and Brian McKnight performed.  “Everyone had the most amazing time,” the source tells PEOPLE. “Kris always throws the best parties.

Two of Robert Kardashian's ex-wives have come forward saying he confided in them that he was unsure of the paternity of the now-27-year-old.  Jan Ashley, who married the businessman after Khloe's mother Kris Jenner, said: 'Khloe is not his kid -- he told me that after we got married.'  And Ellen Pierson, 63, who married Robert in 2003 just two months before his death, has also come forward after eight years of silence to 'tell the truth' about the Kardashian family.  Claims: Two of Robert Kardashian's ex-wives have come forward claiming the lawyer told them Khloe Kardashian, left, was not his real daughter, like older sisters Kim and Kourtney  The reality star has hit back at the claims, calling them 'really low'.  In an explosive interview with Star magazine, Ashley said: 'He just kind of looked at me and said [it] like it was a matter of fact. He said ""Well, you know that Khloe's not really a Kardashian, don't you?""    'And I said… ""OK"" and that was it.'  She claims Khloe, who is married to Dallas Mavericks basketballer Lamar Odom, knew she had a different father to her sisters and younger brother Rob.  'Khloe brought it up all the time. She looked nothing like the rest. She was tall, had a different shape, light hair, curly hair. Didn't look anything like the other three children.'  Different: Khloe has often pointed out that she looks nothing like her older sisters and their mother Kris, far right, said once people asked whether she was 'the milkman's child'  Fighting back: Khloe has responded to the claims today on Twitter She said Robert, who is of Armenian descent, had told her that he and Kris were not sleeping together at the time Khloe was conceived. '[But] he never would have considered a DNA test. He loved her very much. Robert did question the fact that Khloe was his,' Ellen said. 'Any normal man would if they knew their wife had cheated on him.' Khloe has responded to the claims today on Twitter.  Daddy's little girl: Robert Kardashian, pictured with Khloe as a child, referred to having four biological children in court documents filed in 1999 She wrote: 'The audacity you have to mention my father’s name like this! Should be ashamed of urself! I let a lot of things slide but this one is really low… YOU ARE DISGUSTING! (yes you know who YOU are).'    High-profile: Robert represented O.J. Simpson in his murder trial in 1994  Kris, 56, recently admitted in her new book that she cheated on Robert during their marriage.  Since Robert's death, Ellen had experienced financial difficulties, filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2010.  The home she and Robert shared in Indian Wells, California, was sold after going into foreclosure in October.  Kris remarried Olympian Bruce Jenner in 1991 and the couple had two daughters, Kendall and Kylie.  Bruce already had four children from two previous marriages: Burt, Casey, Brody, and Brandon.

Speaking to Star magazine, Jan Ashley revealed that Robert told her directly, ""Khloe's not really a Kardashian, don't you know?"" Ellen Pierson, who married Robert just two months before his death, has also broken her eight-year silence to ""tell the truth"" about the family. Khloe has responded to these allegations on Twitter, expressing her disgust and calling the ex-wives' claims ""really low."" While Kris Jenner, Khloe's mother, has previously admitted to having affairs during her marriage to Robert, both ex-wives assert that Khloe knew she had a different father due to her physical differences from her siblings. Ellen Pierson further maintains that Robert had voiced concerns about Khloe's paternity due to Kris' infidelity. Despite the controversy, Khloe has always considered Robert to be her father and has a close relationship with him. Kris Jenner has also commented on the matter, admitting in her new book that she cheated on Robert during their marriage. Ellen Pierson has faced financial difficulties since Robert's passing, filing for bankruptcy in 2010, and subsequently losing the home she shared with him in California.

gossipcop-5865271192,1,1,"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired. T","Regrettably, Katie Holmes finds herself at the center of swirling reports regarding her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise, and their daughter Suri. According to a recent article on RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the brink of embarking on a $300,000 wedding ceremony. It was believed that their union would solidify their relationship, which has remained mostly concealed for the past five years. However, the 39-year-old actress and devoted single mother perceived that her 50-year-old Oscar-winning partner was not prepared to relinquish his flirtatious habits as a bachelor, including his continued friendly connection with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother of his 8-year-old daughter. The report alleges that Foxx even brought Grannis, not Holmes, as his companion to Leonardo DiCaprio's birthday celebration in November.

Consequently, Holmes made the difficult decision to call off the wedding and privately communicated her decision to end the relationship with Foxx, her co-star in ""Django Unchained."" Sources shared with RadarOnline that Foxx hesitated to agree to a prenuptial agreement containing a clause preventing infidelity because he comprehended the potential consequences should he succumb to temptation. ""Katie noticed a complete lack of respect in Jamie's behavior,"" a source divulged to RadarOnline. ""She understood that it wasn't beneficial for her or Suri and felt compelled to safeguard both of them.""

In the midst of these personal challenges, Holmes has been contending with Cruise's resolute efforts to reestablish a connection with their daughter, Suri. As Hollywood Life reported, citing Star magazine, Cruise has been tormented by the fact that he has been an absent father for over five years due to alleged directives from his Church of Scientology superiors. Tom loyal to Scientology unquestioningly complied with their instructions, thereby sacrificing his relationship with Suri. However, it is now conveyed that he regrets having missed out on so much and yearns to be a part of her life once again.

Holmes, on her part, is torn between her reservations about reuniting with Cruise and her desire to prioritize Suri's well-being. The report from Star stated that Holmes entered an agreement, promising to remain silent about Cruise and Scientology as long as he stayed away from their daughter and refrained from attempting to indoctrinate her into the controversial religious organization. An insider disclosed, ""She's gradually entertaining the notion of a reunion since Suri must be desperately missing her dad. Ultimately, Katie wants what's best for her daughter. Tom has reassured her that his religion will not be a part of their relationship, and Katie is starting to believe him.""

Representatives for Holmes have firmly denied both the breakup rumors involving Foxx as well as the reports about a potential reunion between her and Cruise for Suri's sake. However, it is worth noting that the denial regarding the breakup report was issued by Holmes' publicist, Leslie Sloane, who openly attached her name to the statement. This announcement holds significance since it denotes the first official acknowledgment, on the record, from either Holmes or Foxx regarding the existence of their relationship. Since their alleged dating initiation in 2013, both parties have gone to great lengths to keep their romance concealed – at one point, even necessitating Holmes disguising herself to meet Foxx at a restaurant.

The preservation of secrecy was imperative for Holmes, as her divorce settlement from Cruise allegedly restricted her from publicly dating anyone for five years, as per reports from September 2017. These reports emerged after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo, hand-in-hand, strolling along a Malibu beach. At the time, speculation arose, suggesting that the couple willingly allowed themselves to be captured in this way as the five-year ban on public dating had ostensibly expi"

It received positive reviews from critics and audiences, who praised its subject matter and acting, particularly the performances of Minnette and Langford. For her performance, Langford received a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress in a Drama Series. However, its graphic depiction of issues such as suicide and rape, along with other mature content prompted concerns from mental health professionals. In response, Netflix added a warning card and from March 2018, a video that plays at the start of each season warning viewers about its themes.[2] In May 2017, Netflix renewed 13 Reasons Why for a second season; filming began the next month and concluded that December. The second season was released on May 18, 2018, and received negative reviews from critics and mixed reviews from audiences. A third season was ordered in June 2018 and is set to be released in 2019. Critical and audience reaction to the series has been divided, with the program generating controversy between audiences and industry reviewers. Premise [ edit ] In season one, seventeen year old Clay Jensen returns home from school one day to find a mysterious box on his porch. Inside he discovers seven cassette tapes recorded by Hannah Baker, his deceased classmate and unrequited love, who committed suicide two weeks earlier. On the tapes, Hannah unfolds an intensely emotional audio diary, detailing why she decided to end her life. It appears each person who receives this package of old-style tapes is fundamentally related to why she killed herself. Clay is not the first to receive the tapes, but there is implied detail as to how he should pass the tapes on after hearing them. There appears to be an order to distribution of the tapes, with an additional copy held by an overseer should the plan go awry. Each tape recording refers to a different person involved in Hannah's life contributing to a reason for her suicide. The tapes refer to both friends and enemies. In season two, months after Hannah's suicide, Clay and the other people mentioned on the tapes, as well as close friends and Hannah's family members, become embroiled in a civil legal battle between Hannah's parents and Liberty High School. Alleging negligence on the part of the school, Hannah's mother pursues her perception of justice, while her reluctance to settle pre-trial and her personal circumstances eventually break up her marriage with Hannah's father. The story unfolds with narratives illustrating Hannah's story told by those who present in court at trial. Clay, who ","Thirteen Reasons Why (stylized onscreen as TH1RTEEN R3ASONS WHY) is an American teen drama web television series that has been developed for Netflix by Brian Yorkey. It is based on the 2007 novel Thirteen Reasons Why, written by Jay Asher. The series revolves around the life of Clay Jensen, a seventeen-year-old high school student, and his deceased friend Hannah Baker. Hannah tragically took her own life as a result of struggling to cope with the culture, rumors, and lack of support she faced from her friends and school. Before her death, she recorded thirteen reasons on cassette tapes, explaining why she made the decision to end her life.

The television series is a result of the collaborative efforts of July Moon Productions, Kicked to the Curb Productions, Anonymous Content, and Paramount Television. Brian Yorkey and Diana Son are the showrunners. The main characters in the series include Dylan Minnette as Clay Jensen, Katherine Langford as Hannah Baker, Christian Navarro, Alisha Boe, Brandon Flynn, Justin Prentice, Miles Heizer, Ross Butler, Devin Druid, Amy Hargreaves, Derek Luke, Kate Walsh, and Brian d'Arcy James.

Originally, there were plans for a film adaptation of Thirteen Reasons Why by Universal Pictures, with Selena Gomez set to play Hannah. However, those plans were set aside in favor of a television series. Netflix ordered the show straight to series in October 2015, and Selena Gomez became an executive producer instead. The first season of the series premiered on Netflix on March 31, 2017. It received positive reviews from both critics and viewers due to its engaging subject matter and the exceptional performances of Minnette and Langford. Langford's portrayal of Hannah, in particular, earned her a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress in a Drama Series.

While the series was well-received, it also sparked concerns among mental health professionals because of its graphic depiction of sensitive topics such as suicide and rape. In response, Netflix added a warning card and later included a video at the beginning of each season, cautioning viewers about the themes explored in the show. Despite the mixed reactions, Netflix decided to renew Thirteen Reasons Why for a second season, which was released on May 18, 2018. This season received negative reviews from critics, but the audience's response was more varied.

Following the second season, a third season was ordered in June 2018 and is scheduled for release in 2019. The series has generated controversy among both audiences and industry reviewers, with differing opinions on its impact and portrayal of sensitive subjects. 

The premise of the series centers around Clay Jensen receiving a box of cassette tapes left by Hannah Baker, containing her audio diary in which she explains why she made the tragic decision to end her life. Each person who receives the tapes has some connection to Hannah's reasons for suicide. Clay is not the first recipient, and instructions are given regarding how he should pass on the tapes after listening to them. The tapes follow a specific order of distribution, and an overseer holds an additional copy in case the plan encounters any obstacles. Each recording on the tapes sheds light on a different individual from Hannah's life who contributed to her decision to take her own life. 

In the second season, set several months after Hannah's suicide, Clay and other people mentioned on the tapes, along with close friends and family members of Hannah, become involved in a legal battle between Hannah's parents and Liberty High School. Hannah's mother files a lawsuit against the school, alleging negligence. As the trial unfolds, narratives from several individuals present in court provide insights into Hannah's story. Clay, who believes he failed to protect Hannah, launches his own investigation to gather evidence that could impact the outcome of the case. He also aims to expose the toxic culture at the high school that privileges wealthy, athletic male students at the expense of the average student, especially young girls like Hannah.

Throughout the second season, Clay experiences what appears to be communication with Hannah's ghost, which serves as a plot device. The series features an ensemble cast with various recurring characters who play different roles in the storyline.

Thirteen Reasons Why has garnered both praise and criticism for its portrayal of sensitive topics and its impact on viewers. The series has sparked public debate and divided opinions within the industry and among its audience."

Pregnant Kylie Jenner. Pregnant Kylie Jenner. Yet — Kylie Jenner, 20, has not actually confirmed she is pregnant.  For some celebrities, this would not be a big deal — some stars get pregnant and do not say a word, even as “sources” and “insiders” dish to the tabloids, as illustrated above. For someone in the Kardashian-Jenner family, this is especially confusing.  After all, these family members have become international superstars because they share nearly every detail of their lives, even the painful or uncomfortable moments. As a result, people have become inexplicably fascinated by all of them (Kris Jenner, Caitlyn Jenner, Kim Kardashian West, Kourtney Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian and Rob Kardashian), which has fueled their multimillion-dollar franchise of reality shows and sponsorships.  So the decision to keep Kylie’s apparent pregnancy under wraps is very off-brand for the family. This month, speculation will probably hit even more of a fever pitch, as February is the oft-reported due date for her baby, reportedly a girl.  The non-confirmation of the news — reported by the tabloids in September and described as a “happy” surprise for Kylie and her boyfriend, rapper Travis Scott — has sent some fans into a spiral. On Christmas Day, fans melted down when Kylie did not appear on the family’s annual Christmas card. Starting Dec. 1, Kim released a new part of the photo every day, and many expected Kylie’s announcement to be included in the final photo shoot. No dice.  [Kylie Jenner still hasn’t confirmed her pregnancy. On Christmas, fans melted down on social media.]  Meanwhile, people keep searching for information. TMZ posted blurry footage of Kylie’s first public appearance since the fall, although she’s wearing baggy clothes. Kylie recently posed for a magazine shoot, but is strategically holding a baby lamb in front of her. Meanwhile, some think the announcement will be part of an episode of “Keeping Up With the Kardashians,” which wraps its current season in a few weeks: The website HelloGiggles reported Wikipedia briefly listed the season finale title as “We’re Expecting!” (The title is no longer listed on the Wikipedia page.)

Although according to the tabloids, you might not see Kylie’s baby’s debut for quite some time.  “She very much enjoys being out of the spotlight and can’t wait to spend quiet time with the baby,” a “source” told People, adding Kylie does not plan to sell any photos of her child. “She doesn’t seem in any rush to get back to a more public life.”  Read more:  As Kim and Kanye welcome baby No. 3, the Kardashian deluge of 2018 has officially started  Kim and Kanye named their new baby girl Chicago West, and the city is loving the attention  Perspective | Here’s why Chicago is actually a great name for Kimye’s baby","Kylie Jenner's alleged pregnancy has captured the attention of fans and the media, with numerous headlines speculating on various aspects of her journey into motherhood. Despite the rampant speculation, the 20-year-old reality star has not publicly confirmed the news. This is surprising, given the Kardashian-Jenner family's history of sharing personal details with the world, which has played a significant role in their overwhelming success and popularity.

The lack of confirmation has only intensified the curiosity surrounding Kylie's rumored pregnancy. With reports suggesting that she is due in February and expecting a baby girl with rapper Travis Scott, fans eagerly await any clues or announcements from the young star. Even Kylie's absence from the family's traditional Christmas card caused a stir among her devoted followers.

Fans have resorted to searching for glimpses of the truth themselves, as TMZ released blurry footage of Kylie's recent public appearance, where she was dressed in loose clothing. Additionally, a magazine photoshoot featured Kylie holding a baby lamb in a way that strategically concealed her growing belly. Some speculate that the official announcement may coincide with an episode of ""Keeping Up With the Kardashians,"" as rumors circulated that the season finale would be titled ""We're Expecting!"" However, this information has since been removed from the Wikipedia page.

If Kylie does give birth this month, her child will join the Kardashian family's newest addition, Chicago West, born via surrogate to Kim and Kanye West in January. Khloe Kardashian is also expecting a baby with NBA player Tristan Thompson, due in March. While some believe that Kylie's baby may make a delayed entrance into the public eye, insiders claim that Kylie is savoring her time away from the spotlight and has no plans to sell any photos of her child.

As the Kardashian-Jenner empire continues to expand in 2018, fans eagerly await any developments in Kylie's pregnancy journey, as her decision to keep this major life event private contrasts with her family's usual transparency."

Nicki Minaj, 35, is not entirely shocked to hear about the rumors that Drake, 31, may have a secret son with porn star Sophie Brussaux and even thinks it’s possible he could have other children out there. “Nicki’s not surprised by these rumors,” a source close to Nicki EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife. “Not at all. She actually wouldn’t be surprised if Drake’s got more than once secret love child out there. He’s such a huge player and she knows he’s a target for these girls trying to get that baby mama money. Nicki’s not judging though, it’s his business but she’s damn sure relieved she’s moved on and isn’t still in the mix with him.”  Nicki was in that mix with Drake for a while as the two seemed to have an up and down relationship for many years. He’s also been romantically linked to many other singers such as Rihanna and even Jennifer Lopez. Most recently, Nicki’s been romantically linked to Eminem after she jokingly answered “yes” when a fan asked her if she was dating the rapper. Romantic rumors asider, it’s good to know Nicki is choosing not to judge Drake in the midst of his issues.  Drake’s current issues revolves around his feud with hip hop artist Pusha T. The two have been calling each other out on their own diss tracks and Pusha’s most recent track “Story of Adidon” is what started speculation about Drake’s secret love child. “You are hiding a child, let that boy come home, Deadbeat mothaf**ka playin’ border patrol, ooh Adonis is your son, And he deserves more than an Adidas press run, that’s real, Love that baby, respect that girl, Forget she’s a pornstar, let her be your world,” some of the lyrics to the track read. Drake has yet comment on the speculation.","Nicki Minaj remains unperturbed by the circulating rumors regarding Drake's alleged paternity of a child born from a previous encounter with an adult film actress.

The tabloid is reporting that a source is saying that Taylor is the one reaching out to the actor since she feels she is now more mature than she was when they dated back in 2010.  The source said, “Taylor was so young when they dated, she wasn’t ready for a serious relationship, but now she’s showing Jake how much she’s matured. She’s excited to see where things go.”  In 2015, a rumor swirled around saying that the stars were in contact with each other, even though she was dating Calvin Harris at the time.  An unidentified source told Star magazine that, “He said he owed Taylor an apology for how things ended between them. In June, Jake ran into Cara Delevingne at The Graham Norton Show and asked for Taylor’s new number. They’ve kept in touch, albeit secretly, ever since.""  This would all be so ironic since Taylor allegedly wrote the hit song ""We Are Never Getting Back Together"" from her Red album about the relationship after her ex's friend asked her if they were giving their relationship a second chance.  “This guy walks in who is a friend of my ex’s and starts talking about how he’s heard we’re going to get back together.

In the video for the song, the actor who plays the singer's love interest gives her a scarf which many thought to be a clue that revealed the song was about Jake since she had been photographed wearing one of his scarfs while they were dating.

Uh oh!  “Angelina could tell Brad what’s going on but she’s choosing not to,” a source told InTouch. She reportedly hopes he “will be taken by complete surprise. If it makes Brad unhappy when he finds out, she’s fine with that.” She actually hasn’t even told her six kids about the alleged wedding for fear that they’ll spill the beans to their dad. Crafty!  As for the wedding itself, Angelina’s reportedly taking her closest friends and family to Cambodia, “her second home,” for a traditional Buddhist ceremony, according to the source.

On last Sunday’s BET awards, it was quite clear that Jay-Z and Beyonce were not buddy, buddy with Kim Kardashian. In fact, the camera caught Jay barely acknowledge Kim when he was going on stage to accept his award with Kanye West. Since Jay and Kanye are not only music collaborators but close friends, will “Kimye” stand a chance?  Unfortunately, Kim cannot make Kanye’s friends like her. It will be Kanye’s responsibility to lay the law down with his buddies. He must let it be known that high school bully behavior toward his girlfriend is unacceptable.  If his friends continue to snub her, then the rap star will have to distance himself from his friends until they realize he and Kim are a package deal.  Although Jay-Z and Beyonce have preconceived notions of what Kim and the Kardashians are all about, they do not actually know who Kim is.  If they take off their judgmental glasses, they may even come to like her or at least tolerate her in their group.  Remember, if a friend is happy with their new significant other, don’t hate. There is a strong chance a friend will be lost.  Diana Falzone  More Kim Kardashian and Beyonce Feud","The longevity of Kimye's relationship may be called into question if Kanye's close friends, Jay-Z and Beyonce, continue to distance themselves from Kim. This was made evident during the recent BET awards, where Jay-Z seemed to barely acknowledge Kim while accepting his award alongside Kanye. As important collaborators and intimate friends, Jay-Z's stance on Kim could potentially affect the couple's future. 

Regrettably, Kim cannot control whether or not Kanye's friends like her. It falls upon Kanye to assert boundaries with his buddies and make it clear that treating his girlfriend poorly is unacceptable. If his friends persist in rejecting Kim, Kanye may have to distance himself from them until they recognize that he and Kim are a package deal. 

It is crucial to acknowledge that Jay-Z and Beyonce may have preconceived notions about Kim and the Kardashian family, without truly knowing her as an individual. If they are able to discard their judgmental lenses, there is a possibility that they could develop a liking or, at the very least, a tolerance for her presence within their social circle. 

It is important to remember that when a friend finds happiness with a new partner, it is essential to refrain from harboring negativity. There is a strong likelihood that friendships may be compromised in the process.

gossipcop-83953176,1,1,"Remember when Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux announced their split, just a week after Architectural Digest published a story with photos of their gorgeous midcentury Los Angeles home? It wasn’t so bad on the scale of celebrity breakups, but after less than three years of marriage (a lifetime in Hollywood), it was a tabloid downer for a day or two.  In case there are still people busying themselves wondering if Aniston is happy (just a note, she really doesn’t want you to), please stop. According to the latest tabloid reports, she’s doing just fine. She’s reportedly back on the dating scene with two different beaus, per Us Weekly, and her friends are having trouble not talking about it. One man is reportedly a bachelor who recently split from his wife and the other is an “industry creative,” whatever that ever means. Neither of them is an actor.  But there’s no reason to believe we’ll learn more anytime soon. In July of 2016, Aniston wrote a pretty searing op-ed for HuffPost in which she scolded paparazzi that are constantly obsessed with whether she’s in love or having babies.  “For the record, I am not pregnant,” she wrote then. “What I am is fed up. I’m fed up with the sport-like scrutiny and body-shaming that occurs daily under the guise of ‘journalism,’ the ‘First Amendment,’ and ‘celebrity news.’”  O.K., so, Jennifer Aniston is happy. She’s dating. This is great. Now time to leave her alone and talk about the fact that Justin Theroux knows someone in the South of France with a really great hot tub.  Get Vanity Fair’s Cocktail Hour Our essential brief on culture, the news, and more. And it's on the house. E-mail Address Subscribe","Following the public announcement of Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux's separation, which coincided with the release of an Architectural Digest feature showcasing their stunning midcentury home in Los Angeles, the news generated interest but did not reach the magnitude of other celebrity breakups. The couple's marriage, that lasted less than three years, a significant duration in the Hollywood industry, received attention from tabloids for a brief period. 

However, for those still pondering over Aniston's happiness, it is imperative to respect her wish for privacy. Reputable sources, including Us Weekly, reveal that she has moved on and is currently exploring new romantic connections with two individuals. Notably, neither of them is from the acting profession. One gentleman is reported to be a recently divorced bachelor, while the other is described as an ""industry creative,"" although the exact nature of their profession remains undisclosed.

Nevertheless, it is unlikely that further details will be revealed in the near future. Back in July 2016, Aniston expressed her exasperation in a powerful op-ed for HuffPost, addressing the invasive nature of the paparazzi and the incessant focus on her personal life, love affairs, and potential motherhood. In her own words, she firmly stated, ""For the record, I am not pregnant. What I am is fed up. I'm fed up with the sport-like scrutiny and body-shaming that occurs daily under the guise of 'journalism,' the 'First Amendment,' and 'celebrity news.'""

Therefore, the latest developments indicate that Jennifer Aniston is content and actively dating, which is undoubtedly positive news. It is now crucial to respect her privacy and shift our attention to discussing other topics, such as Justin Theroux's acquaintances in the South of France, particularly someone with an exceptional hot tub.

Relationships can be tumultuous, and when it comes to the romance between Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez, it's been seven years of ups and downs. These two young stars captured the hearts of their fan bases and sparked the iconic #Jelena hashtag. Given their immense fame, their admirers range from loyal supporters to fanatical devotees. Tracking their relationship can be quite challenging, but fear not, as we have meticulously dissected every breakup and reconciliation. Take a seat and get comfortable, because there is a lot to delve into.

In January 2011, the dating rumors surrounding Bieber and Gomez began to circulate. By that same month, the pop stars confirmed their romance with a display of public affection during a vacation in St. Lucia. Their love story was further solidified when they walked the red carpet together for the first time at the Vanity Fair Oscars party in February 2011. Their youthful adoration was on full display at the Billboard Music Awards in May 2011.

Rumors started to circulate in November 2011, suggesting that Gomez had ended the relationship. These rumors stemmed from a Bieber fan's claim that she had slept with him backstage at a show and that he was the father of her child. However, these speculations were eventually debunked. It wasn't until November 2012 that the couple officially broke up, with Bieber briefly being linked to model Barbara Palvin. But don't worry, this was just the first of many breakups.

In January 2013, less than three months after their initial split, Bieber posted a photo of him and Gomez on his Instagram, signaling a possible reconciliation. However, the image was swiftly deleted, leaving fans guessing. At the American Music Awards in November 2014, Gomez performed her single ""The Heart Wants What It Wants"" and openly confirmed that it was about Bieber. The couple made a few more on-again, off-again appearances in the media before officially calling it quits.

In December 2014, Bieber denied dating rumors with model Hailey Baldwin, leading to the rise of the ""Jailey"" ship. Around the same time, Gomez sparked dating rumors with DJ Zedd in January 2015. In September 2015, she opened up about her past relationship with Bieber, expressing her continued support for him. Bieber himself acknowledged their history when he appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in November 2015, revealing which songs from his album Purpose were inspired by Selena.

The roller-coaster continued in January 2016 with Bieber and Baldwin spending New Year's Eve together. However, their romance was short-lived, and they eventually broke up. In August 2016, Bieber was seen with Sofia Richie, and Gomez posted a clip of her singing DJ Snake's ""Let Me Love You,"" a song that features Bieber. Confusion arose, considering her recent feud with Richie, but Gomez's actions remained her own.

November 2016 brought rumors of Bieber visiting Gomez in rehab. Gomez had pulled out of her Revival Tour earlier that year due to complications from Lupus, resulting in anxiety and panic. Meanwhile, in January 2017, Gomez was spotted with Canadian singer The Weeknd, indicating a new chapter in her love life.

The saga of Jelena, as it has come to be known, might be reaching its conclusion. However, with these two celebrities, anything is possible. Only time will tell what the future holds for Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez."
gossipcop-2388806885,1,0,"R. Kelly’s time may have finally come. R. Kelly has been accused of sexual relationships with minors going back to 1994, when he married 15-year-old pop star Aaliyah. (The marriage was annulled.) In the 24 years since then, he has been sued multiple times for inappropriate sexual contact with a minor (he settled out of court every time), and he was eventually charged with creating child pornography. (A jury found him not guilty on the grounds that they could not conclusively identify the other figure in his infamous sex tape as a child.) Last summer, he was accused of creating an abusive “sex cult” of very young women, whom he allegedly isolates, brainwashes, and abuses physically and emotionally. Since the story broke, multiple women have added their own testimonies of abuse at R. Kelly’s hands. (Through a lawyer, Kelly denied all accusations, saying he would “work diligently and forcibly to pursue his accusers and clear his name.”) And in April, another woman accused Kelly of “knowingly and intentionally infecting her with an STD.” Her lawyers say they are currently preparing a federal civil lawsuit. Through a spokesperson, Kelly issued a statement to the Washington Post in which he “categorically denies all claims and allegations.” As man after man has fallen to the #MeToo reckoning, losing jobs and retiring from public life after being accused of sexual harassment and assault, there’s been a recurring whisper: What about R. Kelly? Despite decades of lawsuits and allegations, Kelly’s career has marched steadily on. Last year, he finished an arena tour with a few cancellations. This year, he’s touring with singer Charlie Wilson (some protests are planned). His music appeared in Pitch Perfect 3. At this year’s Coachella, rapper Vince Staples repeatedly referred to Kelly as a “child molester” in an interview with Complex, insisting, “He pees on people.” In our post-#MeToo, post-Time’s Up, post-Harvey Weinstein world, and given the sheer volume of allegations against Kelly, it seems reasonable to raise the question of why he continues to work as much as he does. But Staples’s interviewer only giggled nervously and protested, “We can’t ever talk about this guy. ... You’re about to get me fired from Coachella. It’s my first time here.” Later, Staples tweeted that “R. Kelly people is looking for me.” ladies and gentlemen, vince staples on r kelly pic.twitter.com/SmZdYu9PNJ — andy (@aboynamedandy) April 16, 2018 That stasis may be starting to change. Most of the claims against Kelly were reiterated in a recent BBC Three documentary, R Kelly: Sex, Girls & Videotapes. And over the past year, at least five members of Kelly’s inner circle have left him. His assistant, his accountant, his lawyer, and his rep have all said that they no longer work for him, although none of them have gone into detail about their departures and all have been supportive and complimentary toward Kelly in their statements. His longtime musical accompanist, DJ Phantom, was less circumspect about his decision to leave Kelly in December: “I didn’t know then what I know now,” he said. “He’s a shitbag.” In April, the Women of Color committee within Time’s Up threw its weight behind the #MuteRKelly campaign, calling for anyone currently profiting from Kelly and his music to drop him, including Spotify, Ticketmaster, and Kelly’s record label, RCA. Shortly thereafter, Spotify announced that it would no longer be promoting Kelly’s music, although his music would remain in their streaming catalog. It’s possible that these new developlments mean things are changing for Kelly, and that he’s about to face lasting consequences for those accusations. But if that’s the case, those consequences took more than two decades to reach him. There is a persistent vagueness to the way we talk about R. Kelly that makes it possible to forget exactly what he’s been accused of, how often he’s been accused, and how much proof there is against him. And most likely, that’s because his alleg","R. Kelly’s alleged misconduct, particularly in regard to sexual relationships with minors, has recently been receiving increased attention. These accusations stretch back to 1994 when he infamously married pop star Aaliyah, who was only 15 years old at the time (the marriage was later annulled). Throughout the past 24 years, Kelly has faced multiple lawsuits related to inappropriate sexual contact with minors, all of which were settled out of court. Additionally, he was charged with creating child pornography, although he was found not guilty due to discrepancies in identifying the individuals involved. Most recently, Kelly has been accused of establishing an abusive ""sex cult"" consisting of young women whom he allegedly isolates, manipulates, and abuses both physically and emotionally.

Since these allegations came to light, several women have added their own testimonies of abuse at the hands of R. Kelly. Kelly, through his lawyer, has denied all the accusations, vowing to clear his name by diligently pursuing his accusers. In April, another woman came forward claiming that Kelly intentionally infected her with a sexually transmitted disease, and her legal team is currently preparing a federal civil lawsuit. Kelly, however, has categorically denied these claims as well.

With the ongoing #MeToo movement and the increased awareness surrounding sexual misconduct, it is natural to question why R. Kelly's career has remained relatively unaffected despite decades of lawsuits and allegations. While many high-profile individuals have faced significant consequences for their actions, such as losing their jobs or retiring from public life, Kelly's career has continued to thrive. He completed an arena tour last year, albeit with a few cancellations, and is currently touring with singer Charlie Wilson, albeit with planned protests. Furthermore, his music recently appeared in the film Pitch Perfect 3. Rapper Vince Staples even publicly referred to Kelly as a ""child molester"" during an interview, but the subject was avoided and brushed off.

However, there are signs that this stasis may finally be changing for R. Kelly. The BBC Three documentary, R Kelly: Sex, Girls & Videotapes, brought renewed attention to the allegations against him. Moreover, several members of his inner circle, including his assistant, accountant, lawyer, and representative, have publicly distanced themselves from him, suggesting that his alleged misconduct played a role in their departures. DJ Phantom, his longtime musical accompanist, was particularly candid in his departure, expressing regret for not realizing the truth sooner and describing Kelly as a ""shitbag.""

In April, the Women of Color committee within Time's Up endorsed the #MuteRKelly campaign, urging companies like Spotify, Ticketmaster, and RCA to sever ties with Kelly. Spotify responded by announcing that they would no longer promote his music, though it would still be available on their streaming platform. These recent developments indicate that R. Kelly may finally face lasting consequences for his alleged actions, although it took more than two decades for this to occur.

To combat the vagueness and erasure surrounding R. Kelly's accusations, it is crucial to provide a comprehensive timeline of his alleged sexual misconduct. This includes his marriage to Aaliyah in 1994, the subsequent accusations heard through the years, and his recent involvement in the alleged sex cult. By shedding light on this timeline, it becomes apparent that one consistent pattern emerges: Kelly is repeatedly accused of targeting young girls and women, controlling and abusing them, and then continuing with his life relatively unscathed once the dust settles. It is troubling to observe that his alleged victims, who are predominately young black women, appear to be overlooked by American society.

In conclusion, the numerous accusations and evidence against R. Kelly paint a disturbing picture of his alleged misconduct. While it has taken a considerable amount of time for the consequences to catch up with him, recent developments suggest that change might finally be on the horizon. However, it is essential to remember the individuals who have come forward and bravely shared their stories, as they highlight the urgent need for accountability and justice in cases of sexual misconduct."
gossipcop-7489249320,1,0,"Mark Wahlberg has come a long way from his Funky Bunch days. The successful actor has an important message for anti-Trump celebrities.  While being interviewed for Task & Purpose for his new movie “Patriots Day,” Wahlberg went after celebrities who “lined up to denounce Donald Trump is the months and weeks leading up to Election Day.”  “A lot of celebrities did, do, and shouldn’t,” he told the magazine. “You know, it just goes to show you that people aren’t listening to that anyways. They might buy your CD or watch your movie, but you don’t put food on their table. You don’t pay their bills.”  “A lot of Hollywood is living in a bubble,” Wahlberg continued. “They’re pretty out of touch with the common person, the everyday guy out there providing for their family. Me, I’m very aware of the real world. I come from the real world and I exist in the real world. And although I can navigate Hollywood and I love the business and the opportunities it’s afforded me, I also understand what it’s like not to have all that.”  Wahlberg’s point is well taken. What makes Hollywood liberals qualified to speak on politics? They should have respect for the President of the United States.  Do you agree?","Mark Wahlberg, renowned actor and star of the recent movie ""Patriots Day,"" has shared a thoughtful message with respect to fellow celebrities who publicly criticized Donald Trump in the lead-up to the 2016 election. Speaking in an interview with Task & Purpose, Wahlberg expressed his belief that many celebrities should refrain from engaging in such political discourse. 

In his own words, Wahlberg highlighted the limited impact that celebrity opinions have on the general public, stating, ""You know, it just goes to show you that people aren't listening to that anyways. They might buy your CD or watch your movie, but you don't put food on their table. You don't pay their bills."" Drawing attention to the potential disconnect between Hollywood and the average citizen, he emphasized the importance of understanding the realities faced by ordinary individuals who work tirelessly to support their families.

Wahlberg, speaking from personal experience, noted his awareness of the dichotomy between the glitz and glamour of Hollywood and the starkness of everyday life. He acknowledged his ability to navigate the complexities of the entertainment industry while remaining grounded in the real world, humbly recalling his own journey from relatively modest circumstances. The actor aptly calls upon his peers to consider their privileges and the potential isolation that comes with living in what he refers to as a ""bubble.""

Wahlberg raises a valid point regarding the suitability of Hollywood liberals as political commentators. He advocates for a respectful approach towards the President of the United States, arguing that those in the entertainment industry should exercise caution when expressing their political beliefs. By extending this plea, Wahlberg encourages celebrities to foster a climate of consideration and respect, recognizing the significance of their platforms and how their words can contribute to public discourse.

It is worth considering Wahlberg's perspective on this matter. What qualifications truly make Hollywood liberals authoritative figures in political discussions? In the interest of maintaining a respectful discourse, should there not be an appropriate level of regard for the elected President of the United States?"
gossipcop-9447768564,1,1,"Justin Bieber’s struggling with his split from Selena Gomez as she’s all smiles on her Australian vacation, a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. Here’s how the Biebs is coping with his time apart from Sel.  Justin Bieber, 24, is going through a tough time as his relationship with Selena Gomez, 25, is on pause. She’s currently on vacation with friends in Sydney, Australia, where she appears to be carefree in this new video. However, a source reveals that the same can’t be said for Bieber. “Justin has Selena on the brain constantly. He is trying to drown it out by hanging with friends and doing stuff on his own time but he keeps thinking about her,” a source EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com. “He always wants to be around her, talk to her and be with her. She is like a drug for him, he just needs more and more and more.”  As the Biebs continues to struggle with their time apart, he’s got a few things up his sleeve for when she returns to LA. “He can’t wait until she is back because he wants to really wine and dine her upon her return and really kick start the relationship back up again,” the insider reveals. It’s unclear when Sel is scheduled to return to the West Coast. But, as seen on her Instagram, she is having the time of her life. She posted a video which showed her laughing on a boat, accompanied by a subliminal message, that she “chose” to take care of herself, “not to prove anything to anyone.” Was she trying to give us insight into her most recent split with Bieber?  Jelena fans went into panic mode after seeing Sel in the arms of another man on a boat on March 19. She was photographed hugging and goofing off in photos with Sydney native, Johnny Rays. While all signs point to a friendship between the two, the photos didn’t appear that way to some fans who claimed they looked too close for comfort.  While Sel has been vacationing Down Under, Bieber has been staying active. He’s been photographed playing hockey and soccer with friends. However, his emotions may be getting the best of him as he took a gnarly fall during a soccer game on March 19, and seemingly broke down on the sidelines of a hockey game on March 17.  As you may recall, Jelena reunited in October 2017, after her split with The Weeknd, 28. They seemed inseparable, having spent New Year’s together in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. However, their romance took a rocky turn around Bieber’s birthday on March 1, according to reports.","According to an exclusive source from HollywoodLife.com, Justin Bieber is currently facing difficulties coping with the temporary pause in his relationship with Selena Gomez. While Gomez enjoys her vacation in Sydney, Australia, as depicted in a carefree video, Bieber's mind is consumed by thoughts of her. Despite his efforts to distract himself by spending time with friends and engaging in personal activities, he cannot escape his constant preoccupation with Gomez. The source reveals that Bieber yearns to be in her presence, to communicate with her, and to be connected to her in any way possible. He has become reliant on her presence, comparing it to a potent drug that he craves endlessly.

As Bieber continues to grapple with their separation, he has devised plans for their reunion in Los Angeles. Upon her return, he eagerly anticipates demonstrating his affection by arranging special outings and romantic gestures to rekindle their relationship. Unfortunately, it remains uncertain when Gomez will return to the West Coast. Nevertheless, her Instagram posts portray a joyous and carefree experience, accompanied by a cryptic message suggesting her focus on self-care and a disregard for impressing others. Could this be an indication of her mindset following their recent split?

After witnessing Gomez photographed alongside an Australian man, Johnny Rays, on a boat on March 19, fans of the couple were sent into a state of panic. Although the photos imply a friendly relationship between Gomez and Rays, some fans interpreted their closeness as cause for concern.

Amid Gomez's vacation, Bieber has been keeping himself occupied by engaging in physical activities. Candid shots depict him participating in hockey and soccer games with his friends. However, the emotional toll of their separation seems to have affected him as evident by his severe fall during a soccer match on March 19 and what appears to be a breakdown on the sidelines of a hockey game on March 17.

It is worth noting that Jelena, as they are known to their devoted followers, reunited in October 2017 following Gomez's split from The Weeknd. Their bond appeared unbreakable, even celebrating New Year's together in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. However, reports indicate that their relationship faced challenges coinciding with Bieber's birthday on March 1."

gossipcop-28284230,1,0,"Not so fast! Madonna was hit with a series of “uncomfortable questions” by a judge before she was granted permission to adopt her 4-year-old twin girls from Malawi, the presiding judge said in court documents obtained by The Associated Press on Wednesday, February 8.  “The petitioner is a professional performer and I guarded myself against the danger of her merely reciting a well-rehearsed speech by asking her some rather uncomfortable questions to which she gave very candid answers,” Judge Fiona Mwale said in her ruling, explaining her reasons for approving the adoption.  After pressing Madonna, 58, to explain her intentions in adding two more little ones to her brood of four, Judge Mwale said she was satisfied that the girls would be in good hands with the Material Girl.  “There is no doubt that the petitioner can offer the infants not only the best education money can buy, but also guidance with a high likelihood of ensuring that the two infants grow to be self-sufficient adults,” Judge Mwale said, adding that she is satisfied that Madonna “is motivated by her desire to offer a home, love, protection and guidance to the infants.”  In the court documents, Judge Mwale addressed prior controversies surrounding Madonna’s adoptions in Malawi. “In determining her motives, I questioned the petitioner at length about the impact of her decision which could be construed as robbing Malawi of its most precious resource, its children,” the judge wrote.  As previously reported, Madonna filed for adoption in High Court in Malawi on January 25 but tried to keep the process under wraps until a final decision was made. (The Queen of Pop issued a statement denying her adoption to Us Weekly that same day, claiming that she was in Malawi “to check on the children’s hospital in Blantyre.”) According to the AP, she has already raised $7.5 million for a pediatric surgery ward at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, which is set to open early next year.  Madonna previously adopted son David and daughter Mercy James, both 11, from Malawi in 2008 and 2009, respectively. She is also mom to daughter Lourdes, 20, whom she shares with ex Carlos Leon, and son Rocco, 16, whom she shares with ex-husband Guy Ritchie.  Madonna’s twin girls will retain their birth names as a part of an effort to preserve their identity as Malawian nationals, the court documents said, and their father was at the January 25 court hearing with Madonna. (The twins’ mother died within a week of childbirth due to health complications.)

In her ruling, Judge Fiona Mwale explained that she asked the singer uncomfortable questions to ensure her intentions were genuine. Madonna, being a professional performer, was at risk of delivering a rehearsed speech. However, she provided candid answers that satisfied the judge. Judge Mwale concluded that Madonna would provide the infants with the best education and guidance, ensuring their development into self-sufficient adults. Addressing previous controversies surrounding Madonna's adoptions in Malawi, the judge questioned her motives extensively. The court documents also revealed that Madonna had successfully raised $7.5 million for a pediatric surgery ward at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre. Madonna's previous adoptions in Malawi were of her son David and daughter Mercy James in 2008 and 2009, respectively. The singer shares a daughter, Lourdes, with ex Carlos Leon, and a son, Rocco, with ex-husband Guy Ritchie. The twin girls will retain their birth names to preserve their Malawian identity, as their mother passed away due to health complications shortly after their birth. Madonna took to social media on February 8 to share her joy in officially adopting the twins and expressed gratitude to those who helped make it possible. She also requested privacy during this transitional time."

The insider tells OK! “Rob was basically a 24-hour pot smoker back in his Twilight days, but since his relationship with Twigs got serious he's scaled back on all his vices and hardly ever drinks or smokes around other people.”  If Robert drank due to being stressed with the fame of Twilight, we can only imagine what happened after those infamous photos of Kristen Stewart making out with her movie producer boss while they were still together did to him.

He doesn’t want to hang out with him, or his other hard-partying friends like Tom Sturridge or Eddie Redmayne.”  But we haven’t heard anything negative about FKA Twigs since they started dating in 2014, so it sounds like having a low-profile and more mature partner is exactly what he needed to turn his life around!","During an interview with The Times, he openly shared, ""I just got wasted the whole time.

Ricky got me good! I was so happy that I couldn’t quit smiling. My cheeks hurt!”  The 31-year-old fertility nurse met sales manager Angel on the dating app Bumble (“Ladies pick — finally it was my choice,” jokes Bischoff) last September; the couple moved in together in May.  “On our first date, we just clicked,” she says. “It was easy and that’s the way it should be.”  Still, Bischoff admits it was “nerve-wracking” to jump back into the dating scene after her painful split from Soules in 2015, nearly seven months after they were engaged. “I was still a little bit broken and trying to pick up the pieces. But from day one there was open communication with Ricky about what I had gone through. I think one of the reasons I fell in love so quickly is that I could say everything and know I was not being judged.”  Bischoff hasn’t spoken to Soules recently but says she wishes him well. “I hope that he meets someone, if he hasn’t already, just as great for him and Ricky is for me.”  Now, Bischoff still watches The Bachelor, but says she’s moved on from her own reality show past. “That journey was a big part of my life,” she says. “But since I’ve met Ricky, I really haven’t looked back.”  Busy with wedding plans (the couple are looking at a date next fall), Bischoff says she nonetheless has positive associations with the show. “It’s sad that it ended the way it had to end, but I was still looking for that perfect someone.

It was easy and that’s the way it should be.""

However, Bischoff admits that returning to the dating scene after her painful split from Soules in 2015 was a challenging experience. She was still in the process of healing and trying to rebuild her life. Yet, with Ricky, she found solace in open communication, sharing her past experiences and emotions without judgment. This vulnerability contributed to the rapid development of their love. Bischoff expresses, ""I think one of the reasons I fell in love so quickly is that I could say everything and know I was not being judged.""

Something as simple as a picture of Aniston with her hand on her stomach is proof enough for some tabloids that the actress is expecting a baby. Now, a new report claims that the Friends star has hired a surrogate, could there be any truth to the story?  In the new issue of Star, the tabloid features the headline, “Jen To Justin: I’ll Raise Our Baby Alone!” followed by a story that asserts Aniston wants to become a mom, and she will do it with or without her husband. The publication claims to have a source that reveals Aniston’s marriage is “on the rocks,” and she is planning to be a single mom.  ?…❤️✌️ A post shared by @justintheroux on Aug 5, 2017 at 4:23pm PDT  “Privately, she has told friends that she’s secretly gone ahead and hired a surrogate mother to carry her child to birth. And she’s vowed to raise the baby alone,” tells the insider.  But then the source says the actress is hoping to choose the right woman soon, completely contradicting the earlier quote, which is a huge red flag that something isn’t right with this claim.  But many think the tabloid story is completely false and contradictory quotes prove the story is garbage, questioning why the insider is sharing such private and secret information with a tabloid.  This is the same magazine that published a story earlier this year claiming Aniston herself was pregnant, but then didn’t mention that at all in its latest baby claims.  Aniston told Glamour magazine back in August that not only are the pregnancy tabloid stories guilty of body shaming, but they are also an invasion into a private matter between her and her husband. She said it is no one’s business whether or not she has a baby.  Jennifer Aniston went on to say that the subject of having a baby is a sensitive topic for her, and no one has the right to judge other people’s choices.  Advertisement  What is right for her, may not be right for someone else; and, no one knows what goes on behind closed doors.","Since their marriage, Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux have been plagued by persistent rumors of pregnancy. Trivial observations, such as a photo of Aniston placing her hand on her stomach, have been enough for certain tabloids to speculate about her becoming a mother. In the latest issue of Star magazine, the headline reads, ""Jen To Justin: I'll Raise Our Baby Alone!"" The article claims that Aniston, desiring motherhood, has hired a surrogate and is prepared to embark on this journey with or without her husband. Allegedly, Aniston confided in an anonymous source, disclosing her troubled marriage and her commitment to raise the child as a single parent.

However, this account quickly loses credibility when contradictory statements are mentioned. The insider claims that Aniston is actively searching for the right surrogate, which contradicts their previous assertion. This discrepancy raises doubts regarding the authenticity of the claim.

Many individuals view this tabloid story as entirely false, as the contradictory statements within the article suggest a lack of truthfulness. Additionally, the insider's decision to share such private and secretive information with a tabloid raises questions about their motives and credibility. This particular publication has a history of publishing misleading stories; earlier this year, they claimed Aniston was pregnant, only to disregard this in their recent article.

Aniston has openly expressed her views on these pregnancy tabloids in an interview with Glamour magazine in August. She explained that these stories engage in body shaming and violate the privacy she shares with her husband. Aniston firmly asserted that whether or not she has a baby is no one's business but her own. She emphasized that the decision to have a child is a personal matter, and individuals should refrain from passing judgment on others.

Ultimately, Jennifer Aniston reminds us that each person's choices regarding parenthood are unique and should be respected. Behind closed doors, nobody truly knows the complexities and intricacies of another person's life."
gossipcop-5840642713,1,0,"Sky high prices are reportedly keeping fans from buying tickets to Taylor Swift’s upcoming Reputation tour, per a story by the New York Post. Though her 1989 world tour boasted numerous sold out performances (it eventually became the highest grossing tour of 2015), it appears her considerably more expensive snake persona is a tougher sell.  Last month, her “longtime” tour promoter told Billboard, “By the time all the tickets are sold next week, I’ll be celebrating Taylor’s birthday with a cocktail in my hand and sold-out concerts all over the world.” But her birthday has come and gone, and not one date has sold out.  Reputation was the biggest-selling album of 2017 and the tour is shaping up to be far from ill-attended, so the Post’s headline, “Taylor Swift’s Reputation tour shaping up to be a disaster,” is a little much. It does, however, highlight the problems with unpredictable pricing, scalpers, and Ticketmaster in general.  The company’s “Verified Fan” program, which they would like you to believe is all about rewarding music lovers, appears to be nothing but a cash grab that takes advantage of Swift-obsessed teens with easy access to their parents’ credit card numbers. People willing to drop $50 on merch, the Post reports, could “improve [their] position in line to purchase tickets.” And, once accessible, the tickets are often too expensive for many fans.  “I paid $150 for my ticket with amazing seats for the 1989 tour,” one fan wrote. “Now for the same seats I have to pay about $500.”  Advertisement  In related news, tickets to Katy Perry’s Friday show in New Orleans are currently starting at $23.","According to an article published by the New York Post, it has been reported that the high prices of tickets for Taylor Swift's upcoming Reputation tour are deterring fans from purchasing them. This comes as a surprise, considering her previous 1989 world tour was immensely successful, becoming the highest grossing tour of 2015. However, it seems that her current persona as a more expensive and edgy artist is proving to be a tougher sell.

Just last month, a tour promoter, who has worked with Swift for a long time, confidently stated to Billboard that all tickets would be sold out by Taylor's birthday, with concerts around the world sold out as well. However, Taylor's birthday has passed and not a single date on her tour has sold out.

Despite this, it is important to note that Reputation was the top-selling album of 2017, indicating that the tour is expected to have a decent turnout. Therefore, while the Post's headline claiming that the tour is shaping up to be a disaster may be an exaggeration, it does bring attention to certain issues such as unpredictable pricing, scalpers, and the role of Ticketmaster in general.

Ticketmaster's ""Verified Fan"" program, which is supposed to reward music lovers, appears to be more focused on profit rather than providing a fair opportunity to fans. The program allegedly takes advantage of teens who are obsessed with Swift and have easy access to their parents' credit card numbers. By spending money on merchandise, fans can supposedly improve their chances of getting better positions in the ticket queue. However, once the tickets are accessible, they often turn out to be too expensive for many fans to afford.

A fan mentioned in the Post article shared that they had paid $150 for their ticket with excellent seats during the 1989 tour. Now, for similar seating, they are expected to pay around $500. This significant increase in ticket prices is certainly a cause for concern.

On a related note, it is worth mentioning that tickets for Katy Perry's upcoming show in New Orleans are currently available starting at $23."

gossipcop-6225895099,1,0,"Chris Soules, former star of ABC’s “The Bachelor,” after his arrest. (Buchanan County Sheriff via AP) Iowa farmer Chris Soules, a former star on ABC’s “The Bachelor” who charmed reality TV viewers with his small-town life, was arrested this week after police said he fled a crash that killed a fellow farmer. Soules, 35, was charged with leaving the scene of a fatal crash, a class D felony, and could face up to five years in prison if he is convicted. The case has garnered the attention of Soules’s “Bachelor” fans as well as residents of Arlington, Iowa, where he lives, who had come to appreciate the reality TV star’s work as an unofficial Iowa ambassador and farm industry advocate. “This story is going to spread like wildfire around here and probably all over because of who he is,” Mary Jo Brown, Arlington’s city clerk, told the Des Moines Register. “Sometimes fame isn’t your friend.” Soules, who also appeared in “Dancing with the Stars” and “Worst Chefs in America,” called 911 at 8:20 p.m. Monday evening to report that he had rear-ended a tractor on a rural road north of the tiny town of Aurora, about six miles away from his home. The tractor veered into a ditch after being struck by his 2008 Chevrolet Silverado, Soules said. The tractor driver — later identified as 66-year-old Kenneth Mosher, a Vietnam War veteran — was unconscious and not breathing, Soules told the 911 operator, according to audio obtained by local media. The man had a pulse, but there was blood around his mouth, Soules said. Soules identified himself on the call, which lasted nearly six minutes, and sounded frantic. Between heavy breathing, he answered the dispatcher’s questions and took instructions. Soules told the 911 operator he did not know how to perform CPR and could be heard asking unidentified people at the scene if they could perform the lifesaving measure. The call ended abruptly after the operator told Soules law enforcement and medical first responders were on the way. “Can I, can I call you back really quick?” Soules asked the dispatcher. “Yeah, you can call me back,” she says. “Thank you,” Soules responds. Soules left the crash site after emergency responders arrived, but before deputies with the Buchanan County Sheriff’s Office were on the scene, according to authorities. Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Scott Bright told the Des Moines Register that Soules fled the scene on foot and later got into a truck. In police audio obtained by local media, a deputy told a dispatcher that Soules “took off” in a red truck. Authorities are trying to identify who picked up Soules in the truck, Buchanan County Sheriff Bill Wolfgram told the Associated Press. That person could face charges, he said. Alcohol was found at the scene and investigators are trying to determine whose it was and whether it or speed were factors in the crash. Soules was arrested about five hours after the incident and booked into the Buchanan County Jail, the Associated Press reported. He posted a $10,000 bond Tuesday morning and was released on the condition that he surrender his passport and wear an electronic monitor. During his first appearance in court, the Buchanan County assistant attorney told the judge that Soules refused to cooperate with law enforcement after they located him at his home. He “would not come out,” the attorney said, until officials obtained a search warrant, which “took hours.” Chris Soules making his initial court appearance in Buchanan County @KWWL pic.twitter.com/72bvEg0wVR — Elizabeth Amanieh (@EAmaniehKWWL) April 25, 2017 Wolfgram told the Associated Press that investigators were “running into some roadblocks when it comes to getting information” but acknowledged Soules was acting within his constitutional rights.

In 2011, he was charged three times with underage alcohol possession and pleaded guilty and paid a fine for an open container violation, reported the Des Moines R","Chris Soules, the former star of ABC’s “The Bachelor,” was arrested this week following a fatal crash in Iowa. Soules, known for his role on reality TV, has been charged with leaving the scene of a fatal crash and could potentially face up to five years in prison. This incident has not only captured the attention of Soules’ fans, but also the residents of Arlington, Iowa, where he resides. Soules had previously been admired in the small town for his advocacy of the farming industry and his unofficial role as an Iowa ambassador. The incident occurred when Soules rear-ended a tractor on a rural road. The driver of the tractor, identified as Kenneth Mosher, was seriously injured and subsequently died. Soules immediately called 911 to report the incident and informed the operator of the situation. He expressed his concern for the injured driver and sought assistance from others at the scene. Soules admitted to not knowing how to perform CPR, leading him to request help from others present. The call ended when emergency responders arrived at the scene. However, Soules left the crash site prior to the arrival of law enforcement officials. Authorities reported that Soules initially fled the scene on foot before getting into a truck. The individual who picked up Soules may potentially face charges. The presence of alcohol at the scene is being investigated, along with the possibility of speed being a factor in the crash. Soules was arrested approximately five hours after the incident and has since been released on bail. He has been ordered to surrender his passport and wear an electronic monitor. Soules has been accused of refusing to cooperate with law enforcement upon their arrival at his residence. The investigation is currently facing some challenges, but Soules is exercising his constitutional rights in the process. Background checks have revealed that Soules has had previous encounters with the law, including charges of underage alcohol possession, fighting, noise, and a previous DUI charge. In response to the incident, Soules issued a statement expressing his devastation at the loss of Mr. Mosher's life and offering his condolences to the family. Mr. Mosher, a Vietnam War veteran and lifelong resident of Aurora, was a respected member of his community, known for his love of golf and farming. The community of northeast Iowa has expressed their sympathy for the families involved in this tragic event. Soules gained fame through his appearances on reality TV, first on ""The Bachelorette"" and later as the star of his own season of ""The Bachelor."" He had also made appearances on other shows such as ""Dancing with the Stars"" and ""Worst Chefs in America."" Soules was expected to appear on the upcoming season of ""Bachelor in Paradise."""

Meanwhile, Kanye, hoping for a miracle, resigns himself to a sexless marriage with a heavy heart.

Throughout their public union, Kim Kardashian, now 36 years old, stood by her husband's side when he faced a highly publicized meltdown last year. Despite her unwavering support, their marriage has never fully recovered from the aftermath. Adding to their challenges, Kim continues to grapple with the emotional aftermath of her notorious Paris robbery while juggling her roles as a mother, reality star, and managing her vast business empire. On the other hand, Kanye's music career has hit a standstill after his departure from the Tidal music streaming service, entangled in a complex legal dispute with Jay-Z.

ET’s Katie Krause spoke with Brolin at the Hallmark Channel and Hallmark Movies & Mysteries winter Television Critics Association red carpet on Saturday, where he revealed that despite his decades-long romance, he still doesn't have all the answers.  “I don’t know, because nobody trains you,” he said of the secret to his and Streisand's marriage. “This is my third time -- third marriage. I picked difficult situations the first two times, but I think you learn with each one. I’m a person that believes that if I’m wrong, that’s when I learn, and when I’m right, I haven’t learned a thing.”  Noting that he takes his relationship “day to day,” Brolin revealed that he’s an advocate of marriage counseling.  “I do believe in counseling if anybody ever has a problem in their marriage. Bring in a referee, talk it over, and I swear to you, it will dispel by the end of the session, each time!” he said. “Sometimes in a tough marriage, it’s tough to talk, but if you do, it works!”  The 77-year-old actor has also learned to maintain his marriage with Streisand by not interrupting her during hectic times.  “When she’s busy, she’s really focused, and part of our good relationship is that I understand that,” he shared. “And if I come to her with something important and she says, ‘I don’t have time right now,’ she doesn’t have time, period. That’s the way the mind works. You gotta focus.”  As for how Streisand, 75, makes him feel special, Brolin said, “I’m always welcome when I get home. I always get notes, ‘Hurry home!’ When I get there, there’s always something kind of great waiting for me, some plan, and I try to reciprocate.”  RELATED CONTENT:  Barbra Streisand Calls Out Golden Globes for Not Awarding More Female Directors  ‘Girls Trip' Star Tiffany Haddish Says She Taught Barbra Streisand All About Cardi B  Josh Brolin on His Ripped Bod and How He Knew Wife Kathyrn Boyd Was the One (Exclusive)  Related Gallery","James Brolin and Barbra Streisand are approaching their 20th wedding anniversary, a testament to the strength of their enduring bond. In a recent interview with ET's Katie Krause, Brolin shared insights into their successful marriage, acknowledging that despite their long romance, he doesn't have all the answers. With his previous experiences in mind, he emphasized the importance of learning from past mistakes and growing with each relationship.

Brolin emphasized that he firmly believes in the power of marriage counseling, suggesting that it can provide a valuable perspective and help resolve conflicts. By bringing in a third party to facilitate open communication, he believes that many marital issues can be successfully addressed and ultimately resolved.

One key aspect of maintaining their marital harmony is Brolin's understanding and respect for Streisand's busy schedule. He recognizes that during periods of intense focus and productivity, interruptions can be detrimental. Therefore, he makes a conscious effort to respect her space and time. Likewise, when he seeks her attention, he understands that her unavailability is non-negotiable and does not take it personally.

When asked about the ways in which Streisand makes him feel special, Brolin mentioned the warmth and love he receives upon returning home. Whether through thoughtful notes or exciting plans, Streisand ensures that he feels valued and cherished. In return, Brolin endeavors to reciprocate these gestures, striving to create an atmosphere of mutual care and appreciation. 

The enduring love story of James Brolin and Barbra Streisand serves as an inspiration to all, showcasing the beauty and potential of a committed and supportive union. Despite the uncertainties that come with any relationship, their dedication to each other and their willingness to grow and adapt contribute to the continued success of their partnership."

Heidi, 44, looks like a fountain of youth but it obviously takes more of an effort than we knew. But her loved one are over her ramming her perfection down their throats.  Adds the insider, “What also really annoys people is how Heidi fakes being normal. She even pretends to eat junk food when the cameras are on her but she hasn’t actually swallowed a bite of a burger in years.”  Just last month, she and her boyfriend spent time in Italy, so we really have no idea how she avoided the pasta and pizza!  “All she talks about is working out and what she’s eaten that day – which is usually not much more than a handful of nuts and steamed kale.” That doesn’t sound like fun.","According to a credible source, Heidi seems to be solely focused on discussing her exercise regime, her carbohydrate-avoiding techniques, and the strategies employed by her personal chef and trainer. This preoccupation with her routine has become tiresome for those close to her, including Vito Schnabel, often leading him to seek frequent breaks from their relationship. It appears that Heidi's youthful appearance requires more effort than previously assumed. However, her insistence on flaunting her perceived perfection has become a point of contention for her loved ones. An additional annoyance stems from Heidi's attempts to portray herself as ordinary, even going so far as to simulate indulging in junk food while in front of the camera. In reality, she has not consumed a burger in years. Given that she recently spent time in Italy with her boyfriend, it remains unknown how she managed to avoid pasta and pizza during their trip. The insider remarks that conversations with Heidi predominantly revolve around her workout routine and her daily food intake, which typically consists of no more than a few nuts and steamed kale. Such discussions hardly sound enjoyable."

gossipcop-218256509,1,1,"Postby Guest » Sun Jun 14, 2009 3:22 pm  So things started going downhill after Jen was at the academy Awards show. And smiled at Pitt. Up till tpo that moment Crazy Jo-lie had kept Brad far from Jen. Make no mistake about it. Her frantic traveling all over the place was an attempt at keeping Pitt away from her and and any other person who might think they were a friend. She can't stand anyone but her having anything to do with Pitt . Including his own family. I knew it would backfire one day. Brad what took so long????? She suffers from an extreme mental illness. She doesn't have the kids in school for the same reason.  I do believe she thought it would last. Seeing how sexy and pretty she thinks she is. A man should and would do anything she tells them to.  I am under the impression her treatment of her surrogate Holly had a sort of wake up call to Pitt as to how utterly evil she is. You can bet she dismissed her like a piece of shite. A woman who carried twins for her. Started making Brad see her game of using and abusing.  And when Jen said her and Brad talk all the time on the phone you know that was news to little miss do as I say not as I do Angelina still talks to her ex's Jo-LIE.    Guess all the years of trying to force Brad to believe Jen was a shallow no good woman has a way of catching up to one. It took this long for Pitt to see just what had truly happened. Her spells have lost the power to confuse.In Touch said she has a terrible jealous streak and can't stand Brad even looking at a woman SHE DEEMS ATTRACTIVE IN ANY WAY. WE ALL KNOW HOW MUCH FUN THAT CAN BE.    The National Enquirer  Says Brad is so happy to have a separation from her.Brad's closest friends are woman and that drives Angelina nuts she hates sharing him  He was mad she took the salt role because she had promised him she would stay at home and be a mom.  I mean you can see her doing whatever she damn well wanted to. And he went along with it. But they have twin babies and my guess is she spends very little time bonding with them. What woman would not want to be able to stay with her new little babies. Not this woman. Sick behavior for sure. And the only thing keeping Brad from making it final is the kids.  Angie be careful what you wish for. Seems like 6 kids are going to be without a mom and dad in one place. Good luck with that","After attending the Academy Awards show, Jen's relationship with Brad took a negative turn. Previously, Angelina Jolie had made significant efforts to keep Brad away from Jen, going to great lengths to prevent any semblance of friendship between them. Her constant traveling was motivated by her desire to isolate Pitt from any potential connections. This extended to his own family as well. It was only a matter of time before this strategy backfired. Brad took longer than expected, but eventually saw the truth behind Angelina's extreme mental instability. This is likely why their children are not enrolled in school; she shares this same possessiveness over them. Angelina had likely believed her hold on Brad would last, given her confidence in her own attractiveness. However, her mistreatment and dismissal of Holly, who served as their surrogate, opened Brad's eyes to her manipulative ways. Furthermore, Jen's claims of constant communication with Brad made it evident that Angelina herself was still in contact with her exes. Years of trying to convince Brad that Jen was unworthy of him finally unraveled, as he realized the truth. Angelina's tactics of manipulation are no longer effective. Reports suggest that she possesses an intense jealousy and cannot tolerate Brad even glancing at an attractive woman. It is clear how challenging this can be. The National Enquirer claims that Brad is relieved to be separated from her. As Brad's closest friendships are with women, this would naturally create tension for Angelina, who begrudges sharing him. Angelina's decision to take on a film role greatly angered Brad, as she had promised to prioritize her role as a mother. It is apparent that she acts according to her own will, regardless of their agreement. Although they have twin babies, her commitment to bonding with them appears minimal. It is perplexing that any woman would not cherish the opportunity to spend quality time with her newborns. Such behavior is indeed troubling. The only thing preventing Brad from finalizing their separation is their children. Angelina should be cautious of her desires, as it seems that six kids may find themselves without the presence of both parents in one location. She will undoubtedly face challenges in managing this situation."

Just an hour or so from the capital, it's home (or at least a weekend retreat) to A-listers, politicians and media executives: the Camerons, Beckhams, Kate Moss, Lily Allen and Stella McCartney all have million-pound properties in the area. 'It's like a magnet,' says Sophie Gannon, of Savills Estate Agents in Banbury, Oxfordshire. 'If you get one person, you get them all.' However, Harry isn't following the crowd but listening to his heart. The Cotswolds, and specifically Highgrove, which was bought by his father's private estate in 1980, is where the Prince spent much of his childhood. It was Charles and Diana's weekend home, with 15-acre grounds and, later on, a teenage haven in the cellars of the main house, which Harry nicknamed 'Club H'. £2.95million - Fanthill, Banbury, Oxfordshire: Accessed through electric gates, up a winding driveway, this eight-bedroom house sits among 20 acres of land, so ticks all Harry’s boxes when it comes to privacy. There’s a heated outdoor pool, miniature golf course and a carp lake, where the young lovebirds could row off the private pier A local who knows the family says: 'It's not surprising that Harry would like to live where he feels at home. 'He's lived in the Cotswolds all his life and often returns to visit his father. After his mother died, it became a place of sanctuary. 'When the boys entered their teens, Charles bought several homes in the area, thinking they might want one in the future.' Ten years ago, Charles bought up properties adjacent to his sprawling estate, paying £2 million apiece for nearby manor houses and farm buildings. But sources say rather than living off his father's generosity, Harry wants to invest in a place of his own. £4.25million - Cross Hill House, Adderbury, Oxfordshire: This 10-bedroom house, surrounded by landscaped","Prince Harry, 33, and his girlfriend Meghan Markle, 36, have reportedly begun searching for a new home together. Rumor has it that the couple is particularly interested in high-end properties located in Oxfordshire, nestled within the picturesque countryside of the Cotswold hills. The Cotswolds hold special meaning for Prince Harry, as it is the area where he spent much of his childhood at Highgrove, the weekend home of his parents, Prince Charles and Princess Diana. The allure of this region, with its lush green landscapes and rustic charm, has attracted a number of celebrities, politicians, and media executives, including the likes of the Camerons, Beckhams, Kate Moss, Lily Allen, and Stella McCartney. Not wanting to merely follow the crowd, Prince Harry is following his heart and seeking a place where he feels at home. The connections he has with the Cotswolds, such as family members and close friends who already reside there, make it an ideal location for the couple to establish their own roots. In recent months, the Prince has been spotted discreetly exploring the area, accompanied by his royal protection officers, checking out potential properties where he and Meghan could build a future together. The couple is said to be drawn to the Cotswolds' beauty, privacy, and serene surroundings, which provide a welcome escape from the demands of their public lives. With Prince Harry's requirements of being near London for his royal duties and Meghan's impending departure from her television career, the Cotswolds seems to be the perfect place for them to start their next chapter."
gossipcop-2365987922,1,0,"Jenny and her silk pillowcases.  It’s no secret that Jennifer Lopez-at 48-has a body that won’t quit and skin that needs to be studied so we can all age like the goddess she is.  Dramatic? Not even close.  And while a lot of it may be down to great genes, Lopez has revealed in a new interview some of her beauty secrets and yep, they’re as diva as you might expect.  Lopez credits her glow to positive affirmations, revealing she says one in particular to herself every day to keep her radiant, youthful look intact.  So what is this magic phrase?  “I am youthful and timeless at every age,” Lopez says every single day—but it’s not enough to just say the mantra daily, because Lopez also has a handful of pillows with these words and more mantras embroidered into them all over her home. “I tell myself that every day, a few times a day. It sounds like clichéd bullshit, but it’s not: Age is all in your mind. Look at Jane Fonda.”  Lopez continues, “The affirmations are everywhere. I forget that they’re all here. They’re just part of the house now.”  Before you scoff at Lopez’s positivity there is a school of thought that believes negative thoughts can age you. Australian-born Dr Blackburn, a Nobel Prize winner, co-authored The Telomere Effect: A Revolutionary Approach to Living Younger, Healthier, Longer, with anti-aging psychologist Dr Elissa Epel, which investigated the link between telomeres, which protect our chromosomes, and the effect stress, sleep and diet can have on telomeres and how that directly corresponds with our health.  The book asserts there is a correlation between depression and anxiety and shorter telomeres and that “when pessimists develop an aging-related illness, like cancer or heart disease, the illness tends to progress faster.”  And really there's only so far a little highlight can go, step one is all about a positive attitude. Step two is to find yourself a great pillowcase and settle on your new mantra.  So what’s the lesson here? Your inner glow is only a glass half full attitude away.","Jennifer Lopez, at the age of 48, possesses a remarkable physique and awe-inspiring skin that has captivated the attention of many. While some may attribute her beauty solely to her genetic makeup, Lopez has recently shared her beauty secrets in a revealing interview. These secrets, while perhaps channeling her diva persona, have proven to be effective in maintaining her radiant and youthful appearance.

One of the key factors that Lopez credits for her luminosity is the practice of positive affirmations. Every day, without fail, she recites a specific mantra to herself to uphold her youthful and timeless appearance. However, uttering these words alone is not enough for Lopez. She remains surrounded by a collection of pillows, adorned with various mantras, strategically placed throughout her home. By reinforcing her affirmations multiple times a day, Lopez firmly believes that age is merely a state of mind, referencing the timeless beauty of Jane Fonda as evidence.

Before we dismiss Lopez's positive mindset as mere whimsicality, it is important to acknowledge the scientific research that emphasizes the impact of negative thoughts on the aging process. The Telomere Effect: A Revolutionary Approach to Living Younger, Healthier, Longer, authored by Dr. Elizabeth Blackburn, a Nobel Prize winner, and anti-aging psychologist Dr. Elissa Epel, delves into the connection between telomeres and various lifestyle factors such as stress, sleep quality, and diet. The book reveals that depression and anxiety are correlated with shorter telomeres, and individuals with pessimistic attitudes tend to experience accelerated progression of aging-related illnesses.

Given these compelling findings, it becomes evident that attitude plays a vital role in maintaining a youthful appearance. However, promoting a positive outlook is just the first step in this journey. The second step involves investing in a quality pillowcase that aligns with your newfound mantra. By embracing a glass-half-full mentality and practicing affirmation techniques, one can unlock their inner glow and radiate a youthful aura.

In conclusion, Jennifer Lopez's commitment to positive affirmations and her embellished pillows may seem eccentric at first glance, but scientific evidence supports the notion that cultivating a positive mindset can indeed contribute to a more youthful and vibrant appearance. The lesson here is clear: by adopting a positive attitude and investing in self-affirmation practices, we can enhance our inner radiance and embrace the potential for timeless beauty."
gossipcop-4678149709,1,1,"Since separating from Channing Tatum in April, Jenna Dewan has put a cheery spin on the end of their nine-year marriage. “I feel I’ve been on a wave of growth,” Jenna said recently. “It’s OK for a relationship to change into a new form that is actually better for both people involved, and I think that’s maybe what shocked everyone so much — that it can be a positive thing.”  But it's apparently not so positive anymore. Each time Channing and Jenna head to mediation to discuss the terms of their divorce, “they can’t seem to agree on anything,” says a source. “Their meetings have been contentious.” One big issue: their five-year-old daughter, Everly. “They can’t agree on custody,” a friend tells In Touch exclusively.      Unicorns do exist. A post shared by Channing Tatum (@channingtatum) on May 4, 2018 at 6:40pm PDT      “They’re both working hard to do what’s in the best interest of their daughter, but it’s just taking way longer than they both expected because they can’t agree on the small details.” Another sticking point: Channing’s estimated $60 million fortune. Though Jenna, 37, has had a successful movie and TV career with shows like Supergirl, Channing, 38, has starred in several blockbusters, such as Magic Mike and 21 Jump Street, and was the family’s main breadwinner. “Jenna has told friends that she gave Channing the best years of her life,” says the source, “and now she’s trying to negotiate a very secure future for herself.”  There is a lot at stake financially. During the course of their marriage, the pair acquired several assets, including a $6 million Beverly Hills home and pricey cars including a Tesla and a vintage Chevrolet truck. Finding common ground about dividing their stuff “is not easy,” says the friend. “They both want it to be over with.”          Jenna never thought it would come to this. “She isn’t pleased about how it’s all played out so far,” says the source. “She’s bitter. There are days when she’s blaming him for not working harder to save their marriage.” And while she’s told pals that she hopes they can stay friends, adds the source, deep down “she knows that’s never going to happen.”  Channing shouldn’t underestimate Jenna, says the source: “She’s looking out for herself, and at the end of the day she knows that he’s got to pay. She’s not going to walk away quietly.”  For more on this, pick up the latest issue of In Touch — and for more exclusive content sign up for our newsletter.

She has expressed that she sees it as a period of growth and believes that relationships can evolve into something better for all parties involved. However, recent developments indicate that the situation is not as harmonious as initially perceived. According to a source, Channing and Jenna have been unable to reach agreements during their divorce mediation sessions, leading to contentious meetings. One significant point of contention is the custody of their five-year-old daughter, Everly. A close friend has revealed that the couple is struggling to find common ground on this matter, as well as on the smaller details surrounding their separation. 

Finances also play a crucial role in their divorce proceedings. Channing, with his successful acting career that includes blockbuster hits like Magic Mike and 21 Jump Street, has amassed an estimated fortune of $60 million, making him the primary breadwinner. Jenna, although known for her own successful movie and TV career, including roles in Supergirl, is determined to secure her financial future. The couple jointly acquired valuable assets throughout their marriage, including a $6 million Beverly Hills home and expensive cars such as a Tesla and a vintage Chevrolet truck. Dividing these assets has proven to be a challenging task, with both parties eager to bring an end to the process.

Jenna never anticipated that their divorce would reach this point. The source reveals that she is dissatisfied with how things have unfolded and has moments when she places blame on Channing for not working harder to save their marriage. While she hopes to maintain a friendship with Channing, she acknowledges that it is an unlikely outcome. The source emphasizes that Jenna is determined to prioritize her own interests and expects Channing to provide a fair financial settlement. She will not quietly walk away from the situation.

From “cool pants” to clover emojis, there’s a lot of backstory that needs explaining in order to completely understand everything that went down among Kanye West and Wiz Khalifa and Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna. To keep you informed, Us Weekly has broken it down with a comprehensive timeline of events. Kanye West Dates Amber Rose In 2008, the Grammy-winning rapper started a relationship with unknown model Rose after spotting her in Ludacris’ “What Them Girls Like” music video. The pair had a public two-year romance. Amber Rose Breaks Up With Kanye West In mid-2010, Rose called things off with West. A year after the split, Rose appeared on The Wendy Williams Show, noting, “[Kanye] said that he was an a-hole and he was mean to me and he didn’t treat me the way he was supposed to. I accepted his apology because I feel like he’s remorseful for how he treated me.” Blac Chyna and Tyga Have a Son, Get Engaged Meanwhile, an up-and-coming rapper named Tyga welcomed a baby boy named King Cairo Stevenson with his then-girlfriend, model Blac Chyna, in October 2012. “Most amazing feeling ever. #Blessed #2Kings,” Tyga captioned a Twitter photo cradling his little boy. That December, the couple confirmed they were engaged in an Instagram post featuring Chyna’s giant diamond ring. Kanye West Starts Dating Kim Kardashian Fresh off his split from Rose, West set his sights on his longtime friend and crush Kim Kardashian in early 2012. The pair were spotted out together and Kardashian’s famous family even started pressing the reality star for details on her new romance (remember when he let her borrow his car?!). Kanye West Raps About Wiz Khalifa, Amber Rose As West’s romance with Kardashian blossomed, so did that of his ex Rose and her new rapper fiancé, Wiz Khalifa.

As new mom Kim worked hard to get back to her pre-baby weight in time for her wedding to West, she posted selfies in workout clothes with Chyna by her side. Kanye West Marries Kim Kardashian After gracing the cover of Vogue in wedding couture, the A-list couple tied the knot in an elaborate European wedding weekend that began in Paris and ended with an Italian ceremony in May 2014. Rob Kardashian Skips the Wedding, Remains Under the Radar Things got awkward when Kim’s younger brother, Rob Kardashian, left Kim’s wedding festivities early. His exit followed months of erratic behavior: avoiding appearances on the family’s reality series, Keeping Up With the Kardashians, significant weight gain and depression. He’s stayed out of the public eye ever since. “He sent me a long email the morning of [saying] that he was going to leave,” Kim later said on Watch What Happens Live. “There was no fight.” Blac Chyna and Tyga Split In August 2014, the parents called it quits. “They are trying to keep it amicable,” ","In January 2016, a notable series of feuds involving the Kardashian-Jenner-West-Rose-Chyna families emerged, captivating the public's attention. These longstanding conflicts among Kanye West, Wiz Khalifa, Rob Kardashian, and Blac Chyna require a thorough understanding of their complex backstory. To ensure you are well-informed, Us Weekly has meticulously compiled a comprehensive timeline of events. 

Kanye West and Amber Rose formed a romantic relationship back in 2008 after West noticed her in Ludacris' music video for ""What Them Girls Like."" Their public romance lasted for two years until Rose decided to call it off in mid-2010. Speaking about their split on The Wendy Williams Show, Rose mentioned that West had expressed remorse over his behavior towards her.

Meanwhile, Tyga, an up-and-coming rapper, and model Blac Chyna welcomed their son King Cairo Stevenson in October 2012. Tyga shared his joy on Twitter, describing it as an incredible feeling. The couple confirmed their engagement later that year through an Instagram post featuring Chyna's impressive diamond ring.

In early 2012, shortly after his breakup with Rose, West began dating his longtime crush and friend, Kim Kardashian. Their relationship became a topic of public interest, with Kardashian's family eagerly seeking details about their romance. 

As West's romance with Kardashian blossomed, so did Rose's relationship with her new fiancé, Wiz Khalifa. In April 2012, West released the song ""Cold,"" wherein he confessed his love for Kardashian and his respect for Khalifa. 

Rose and Khalifa welcomed their first child, Sebastian, in February 2013 and secretly tied the knot in July that same year. The following month, they had a more elaborate ceremony, with Rose stunning everyone in a Pnina Tornai for Kleinfeld gown.

In June 2013, Kim Kardashian gave birth to their daughter, North West, following a complicated pregnancy. West dedicated the song ""Only One"" to his newborn daughter. 

Blac Chyna began appearing in Kim Kardashian's Instagram photos in 2014. As Kim strived to regain her pre-baby figure before her wedding to West, she posted gym selfies alongside Chyna. 

The high-profile couple tied the knot in May 2014 after gracing the cover of Vogue and celebrating with a luxurious European wedding weekend.

Things took an awkward turn when Rob Kardashian, Kim's younger brother, left her wedding festivities early. His behavior had become erratic, as he withdrew from the family's reality television show, gained significant weight, and battled depression. Rob has remained out of the public eye since then.

In August 2014, Blac Chyna and Tyga ended their relationship, aiming to keep things amicable due to their shared friendships with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian.

Rose, despite her previous intentions to spend her life with Khalifa, filed for divorce in September 2014, just 14 months after their marriage. She expressed her heartbreak on Twitter, revealing the pain she was experiencing.

During the fall of 2014, Tyga and Kylie Jenner, the youngest of the Kardashian-Jenner family, sparked dating rumors when they were frequently seen together. Although they never publicly acknowledged their romance due to Jenner's underage status at the time, the couple became the subject of speculation.

Following her split from Khalifa, Rose formed a close bond with Chyna, who had become estranged from Kim Kardashian due to the Tyga and Kylie dating rumors. Rose made her opinions known on The Breakfast Club radio show in February 2015, condemning Tyga's involvement with the much younger Jenner. 

Not one to stand by, Khloé Kardashian defended her sister on Twitter, engaging in a feud with Amber Rose. The exchange on social media highlighted the tension between Rose and the Kardashian-Jenner family."

Photo credit: BACKGRID  “His head took the brunt of the fall,” the informant dished to Radar. “He was wearing a helmet, but God knows what kind of damage he may have suffered!” Photo credit: BACKGRID  Doctors believe the fall may have caused injuries to Affleck's skull that could have frightening implications. Even with the protection of his helmet, medical experts agree a fall like that could cause dangerous scarring or bleeding around the brain. Photo credit: BACKGRID  Without a thorough checkup, though, the effects from the fall could be masked until they become life-threatening! “You can usually spot injuries with an X-ray or CT scan within the first 24 hours of a serious trauma to the head and neck area,” Dr. Stuart Fischer, who has never treated the actor, told Radar. “But without this kind of testing, serious injuries can go undetected for weeks or even months — and that may be too late!” Photo credit: BACKGRID  Blunt force trauma to the head can result in a subdural hematoma, which can cause a pool of blood to push on the brain.

He has been battling alcoholism for nearly two decades and did his first rehab stint in 2001. He also is obsessed with blackjack and was booted from a top casino! Photo credit: BACKGRID","Ben Affleck is currently facing a crisis involving potential brain damage as a result of a recent motorcycle accident, as reported by RadarOnline.com. Friends of the 45-year-old actor express immense concern that he has pushed himself to dangerous limits following the end of his marriage to Jen Garner. Photos of the disturbing crash scene have been exclusively obtained by Radar, showcasing the severity of the incident. A peculiar twist of fate occurred when Affleck wrecked his new high-powered motorcycle, touted as the fastest in the world, on his way to church. The crash led to him hitting his head against a curb, although he managed to limp away from the accident. However, friends and medical experts fear that there may be long-term effects resulting from this collision. According to an unnamed source, Affleck's head absorbed most of the impact even though he was wearing a helmet. The true extent of the potential damage is unknown, but doctors believe that serious injuries could have occurred to his skull. Subdural hematoma, characterized by blood pooling and exerting pressure on the brain, is one possible consequence of such blunt force trauma. If untreated, this condition can lead to permanent brain damage or even death. Medical experts caution that the effects of the fall may not become apparent until they reach a life-threatening stage, making immediate attention crucial. Dr. Stuart Fischer, who has not treated Affleck, recommends thorough medical examinations such as X-rays or CT scans within 24 hours of head or neck trauma. Affleck's crash is not surprising to friends, who claim that he constantly embraces a high-octane lifestyle. His decades-long struggle with alcoholism, which led to his first rehab stint in 2001, has become well-known. Additionally, his affinity for blackjack has resulted in his expulsion from a prominent casino."

gossipcop-9639077061,1,0,"Ivanka Trump is becoming one of the most powerful first children in American History – despite not having an official job in the Trump administration. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) Ivanka Trump’s products weren’t always the hottest items online. In January, for instance, the first daughter’s fashion line ranked No. 550 based on the number of orders from Lyst, the biggest fashion e-commerce website in the world, according to Forbes. That changed dramatically the following month. Sales of Trump’s products skyrocketed in early February, making her Lyst’s 11th most popular brand. The biggest spike, according to Lyst, came on Feb. 9, when sales jumped by 219 percent from the day before. Yes, Feb. 9 — the same day that White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted Trump’s clothing and jewelry line on “Fox & Friends.” “Go buy Ivanka’s stuff is what I would tell you,” Conway said. “I’m going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody.” And viewers did, apparently. Sales of Ivanka Trump’s branded products skyrocketed on Feb. 9, the same day White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted the line on Fox News. (Lyst) Abigail Klem, president of the Ivanka Trump brand, said in a statement that “the beginning of February” shows “the best performing weeks in the history of the brand.” “For several different retailers, Ivanka Trump was a top performer online, and in some of the categories it was the best performance ever,” Klem said. Sarah Tanner, Lyst’s spokeswoman, said increases in sales are usually tied to current events. For instance, interest in pantsuits went up by 460 percent last year because of Hillary Clinton’s affinity for the style, she said. Sales of the first daughter’s products went up by 86 percent in November when her father won the presidential election, according to the company. Conway has come under fire for touting Ivanka Trump's clothing line during a televised interview. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) [A Trump wine boycott backfires spectacularly] But the brand was “largely featured” in the news in February, Tanner said. Conway gave her on-air endorsement of Ivanka Trump’s brand after President Trump had complained on Twitter that his daughter had “been treated so unfairly” by the department store Nordstrom, which dropped her clothing line over slow sales. “It would not be a surprise to us if it resulted in the increase in sales,” Tanner said of Conway’s Fox interview. “I think that’s one of the reasons the brand was largely in the news and could have attributed to this increase.” Conway did not respond to an email requesting comment. Her promotion of the fashion line appeared to violate an ethics rule barring federal employees from using their public office to endorse products and immediately drew criticism from both Democrats and Republicans. [Where does the Ivanka Trump brand go from here?] Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said Conway’s comments were “absolutely wrong, wrong, wrong” and “clearly over the line,” The Washington Post reported. The White House later said that Conway had been “counseled.” But concerns about her comments remain. On Thursday, the government’s top ethics official criticized the White House for not disciplining Conway, The Post’s Drew Harwell reported. Walter M. Shaub Jr., director of the Office of Government Ethics, had urged officials last month to reprimand the White House counsel but was rebuffed. On Thursday he wrote to Stefan C. Passantino, who handles White House ethics issues as the president’s deputy counsel. “When an employee’s conduct violates, disciplinary action serves to deter future misconduct,” Shaub wrote. “Not taking disciplinary action against a senior official under such circumstances risks undermining the ethics program.” [A Trump voter’s message to retailers: ‘Keep your mouths shut about our president’] Last month, a group of law professors filed a professional misconduct complaint against Conway — a","Ivanka Trump, despite not holding an official position in the Trump administration, is emerging as one of the most influential first children in American history.

Sales of Ivanka Trump's products on Lyst, the world's leading fashion e-commerce website, skyrocketed and made her the 11th most popular brand. The sales spike occurred on February 9th, the same day when White House counselor Kellyanne Conway openly endorsed Trump's clothing and jewelry line on ""Fox & Friends."" Apparently, viewers responded to Conway's endorsement, as sales soared by 219 percent from the previous day. Abigail Klem, president of the Ivanka Trump brand, stated that the beginning of February was the best performing period in the brand's history, with some categories even achieving the best performance ever. Sales of Ivanka Trump's products tend to be influenced by current events, similar to how interest in pantsuits surged by 460 percent due to Hillary Clinton's preference for that style. When Donald Trump won the presidential election in November, sales of Ivanka Trump's products rose by 86 percent. Thus, it is plausible that Conway's endorsement played a significant role in the increase of sales for Ivanka Trump's brand. Lyst spokesperson Sarah Tanner acknowledged that the brand received significant media coverage in February. Conway's endorsement occurred after President Trump expressed dissatisfaction on Twitter about Nordstrom, a department store that dropped his daughter's clothing line due to sluggish sales. It is reasonable to assume that Conway's interview contributed to the surge in sales by generating substantial media attention for the brand. Both Democrats and Republicans criticized Conway's actions, as it seemed to violate an ethics rule forbidding federal employees from endorsing products while holding public office. Representative Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the House Oversight Committee, stated that Conway had crossed the line and should be reprimanded. Although the White House insisted that Conway received counseling, concerns regarding her comments remain. Walter M. Shaub Jr., director of the Office of Government Ethics, criticized the White House for not taking disciplinary action against Conway. In a letter to Stefan C. Passantino, who handles White House ethics issues, Shaub emphasized the importance of disciplinary action to deter future misconduct and ensure the integrity of the ethics program. Last month, a group of law professors filed a professional misconduct complaint against Conway, highlighting her on-air endorsement of Trump's products as one of the reasons. Lyst reported unusually high numbers of orders for a wide range of Ivanka Trump-branded products in February, including dresses, shoes, pants, coats, knitwear, and tops. Heels were particularly popular, followed by dresses. Such a sharp increase in sales was unprecedented, as Ivanka Trump's products typically do not rank among the top 100 sellers on Lyst. Comparing February's sales with the average number of orders from last year revealed a remarkable difference of 557 percent. Although the excitement around the brand seemed to be declining toward the end of February, Lyst projected that sales in March would still exceed those of January by approximately 8 percent. Despite an aggressive boycott campaign called ""Grab Your Wallet,"" initiated in October 2016, the Ivanka Trump brand appears to have survived. The campaign encouraged shoppers to avoid retailers that carried Trump-branded products. Nevertheless, some retailers, such as Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus, and Belk, ceased selling Trump's line entirely or partially distanced themselves from it. T.J. Maxx and Marshalls instructed employees not to promote Trump products in their stores and relocated Trump clothing to general merchandise racks. Sears Holdings and subsidiary Kmart stopped online sales of 31 items from the Trump Home collection, but third-party sellers still offer Trump-branded products on their websites."

Kareem Quow for KQ Photography  Holliday, best known for her Tony-winning role in Broadway's ""Dreamgirls,"" faced pressure from her gay, lesbian and black fans when it was announced she would sing at a Thursday concert at Washington's Lincoln Memorial.

Holliday's reversal was first reported by The Wrap; the publication obtained a letter Holliday wrote to her fans.

The performer, who most recently starred on Broadway in ""The Color Purple,"" said she was hurt by the angry backlash, which included calls to boycott her music.

While public debate rages about Donald Trump’s health, Melania has told friends and associates that the once robust and high energy man she knew and loved has been replaced with a “slower, damaged version”.  “By 8pm he is slurring,” she said. “This is not the man I know.”  Fearing that the sedatives are being pumped into the body of the POTUS via Coca-Cola that he orders by pressing a button he had installed on the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, Melania has insisted he stop drinking from the tap and instead revert to drinking from cans she brings herself.  “Donald’s heath improved out of sight when he stopped drinking from the tap,” Melania said.  However the First Lady fears the active campaign to poison the president is “a high level operation” and “not the work of a solitary loon.”  Melania is popular in the White House—as she is with the rest of the country—and she has befriended senior intelligence agency staff who remain loyal to president. They have educated her about Ronald Regan’s poisoning by the Deep State after his assassination attempt in 1981. They have also warned her that George W. Bush was reduced to a “brain damaged” state after years of steady poisoning.  But the advantage Trump may hold over his GOP predecessors in the Oval Office is that he has a wife who is wise to the ruse and is insisting he watch his food and drink intake closely for signs of adulteration.  Donald Trump’s food choices say a lot about the man. The president’s Howard Hughes-level pickiness when it comes to food is partly motivated by a desire to avoid being poisoned, according to Melania. He doesn’t trust those around him – and rightfully so.  As President Trump knows all too well, there are enemies of the state dug in deep at the White House.  Reporters from TIME recently got a glimpse behind-the-scenes at the White House, where they reported on what goes down at the president’s dinner table. Of particular interest was a meal enjoyed by the reporters, Trump, and Vice President Pence.  Pence’s meal was not unusual—he ate what everyone else did. But the POTUS received a meal fully customized to his own preferences, and closely observed by Melania who insisted on watching the chef prepare the meal with ingredients she provided herself.","According to reports, First Lady Melania Trump has recently expressed concerns about a potential poisoning threat in the White House. Melania believes that her husband, President Donald Trump, may be slowly poisoned with sedatives that are smuggled into his drinks. Worried about his declining health, Melania has confided in friends and associates that the once energetic President she knew and loved has become a slower and damaged version of himself. She noted that by 8pm, he often experiences slurring speech, which deeply worries her.

In an attempt to safeguard the President's well-being, Melania suspects that the sedatives are being added to President Trump's favorite Coca-Cola drinks, which are conveniently delivered to him via a button he had installed on his desk. In an effort to prevent any possible tampering, Melania has urged him to stop drinking directly from the tap and instead opt for cans that she personally provides. Surprisingly, this change in drinking habits has resulted in a noticeable improvement in the President's health, according to Melania.

However, the First Lady believes that the campaign to poison her husband is not the work of a solitary individual, but rather a sophisticated operation conducted by a group or organization of high prominence. Melania, who is well-liked in the White House and has established friendships with senior intelligence agency staff loyal to her husband, has been educated on previous instances of poisoning in the political sphere. She was informed about the poisoning attempt of Ronald Reagan after his assassination attempt in 1981, as well as the alleged gradual poisoning of George W. Bush, which led to his diminished cognitive abilities.

Unlike his predecessors, President Trump may have an advantage in the form of Melania, who is keenly aware of the potential dangers and insists that he closely monitors his food and drink intake for any signs of adulteration. Melania has revealed that her husband's discerning food choices stem from a deep-rooted concern about being poisoned, as he holds a level of mistrust toward those around him—a sentiment that Melania believes is justified. She is fully aware that the White House harbors individuals who pose as enemies to the security and wellbeing of the state.

Recently, TIME magazine managed to gain insight into the President's dining experiences at the White House. During a particular meal attended by reporters, President Trump and Vice President Pence, it was observed that while Pence's meal was ordinary, Trump's was fully customized to his specific preferences. Melania closely watched the chef prepare the President's meal using ingredients that she personally provided, ensuring utmost vigilance against any potential threats.

Melania's unwavering commitment to President Trump's safety and well-being demonstrates her dedication as a First Lady. Her understanding of the risks and her proactive approach in protecting her husband from any potential harm is a testament to her astuteness and concern for his welfare."
gossipcop-9067064195,1,1,"Tom Cruise has seemingly been all about his movie career since his high-profile marriage to Katie Holmes met its demise. The action star has steadily starred in film after film, yet has been at the center of several dating rumors.  As the International Business Times reports, “The actor was mistakenly linked to an Australian journalist and then was associated to his Mission: Impossible 6 co-star and Crown actress Vanessa Kirby.”  All rumors until now have been stamped out as false.  However, the latest claims include those stating that members of the Church of Scientology have once again been playing matchmaker for the Top Gun star and that Cruise has reportedly been secretly dating over the past little while. Interestingly enough, Tom has reportedly been using a disguise to enjoy dates with the ladies, much like Katie Holmes did in the initial stages of her romance with Jamie Foxx.  A source told the publication about Cruise’s tactics to keep his love life out of the spotlight.  “Tom’s back on the dating scene, but nobody knows it’s him. His face is way too recognizable for him to stroll into the bars, so he has his makeup artist create a silicone mask. Seems like Tom took his Mission: Impossible role to heart. It’s just what Ethan Hunt would do in the movies.”  It’s also been claimed that the disguise, which includes makeup, takes a full five hours to apply. If this rumor all sounds a little far-fetched, that’s because it is completely untrue, according to Gossip Cop. Tom Cruise does not go through some elaborate process to secretly step out on dates. In fact, there has not been any confirmation that Tom Cruise has dated anyone since Katie Holmes.  Alberto E. Rodriguez / Getty Images  Katie Holmes, however, continues to attempt to keep her romance with Jamie Foxx a secret, despite the fact that the pair has been spotted on numerous occasions over the past year on beach getaways and romantic locales like Paris.

Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx were spotted on another romantic beach getaway https://t.co/ZwdutxFdYe pic.twitter.com/dhoszJ2wg3 — Travel + Leisure (@TravelLeisure) December 19, 2017  Onlookers at the hotel stated that the duo appeared to be quite awkward while Katie kept looking around cautiously. The couple was also seen walking along the beach while Foxx had his arm around the beauty. This report is similar to the one earlier this year that stated Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx were spotted strolling along the beach hand-in-hand in Malibu.","Tom Cruise, known for his successful movie career, has recently found himself amid dating rumors following the end of his marriage to Katie Holmes. However, all previous rumors linking him to various individuals have been proven false. Nonetheless, recent claims suggest that members of the Church of Scientology have once again been involved in setting up the actor with potential partners. It has been reported that Cruise has been secretly dating, adopting a disguise similar to the one Holmes used in the early stages of her relationship with Jamie Foxx. According to a source, Cruise's familiar face makes it difficult for him to go unnoticed, prompting him to have a silicone mask created by his makeup artist. To maintain authenticity, the mask, along with makeup, takes approximately five hours to apply. However, Gossip Cop has dismissed these claims as completely untrue, emphasizing that there is no confirmation of Cruise dating anyone since his split from Holmes. In contrast, Holmes continues to keep her relationship with Foxx hidden, despite being frequently spotted together on vacations and in romantic settings. Recently, the couple celebrated Foxx's birthday at a Santa Monica beach hotel, where onlookers commented on their cautious behavior. They were seen walking along the beach with Foxx's arm around Holmes, reminiscent of previous reports of their hand-in-hand stroll in Malibu."

Born Kate Garry Hudson on April 19, 1979, in Los Angeles, California, US, she came to prominence in 2001 with her incredible turn in Almost Famous. This role not only made her famous, but it also fetched her a Golden Globe and several nominations, including a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Being a daughter of American actress Goldie Hawn, Hudson bears more than a passing resemblance to her famous mother in both looks and onscreen vivacity. She got the chance to showcase her talent in 1996, when she made her TV debut on Fox's TV series Party of Five (1994-2000). Although she only appeared in one episode titled ""Spring Breaks: Part 1"", this initial experience was enough to uphold her determination to develop a professional acting career in Hollywood. However, it was in 1999 that she started to attract public attention when critics lauded her brilliant portrayal of Cindy in ""200 Cigarettes"", even though the movie itself was a commercial disappointment. Onwards, her career experienced a significant advancement, especially after she managed to obtain a supporting role in ""Gossip"" and ""Dr T and the Women"" which both came up in 2000. While her accolade-worthy performance in Cameron Crowe's Almost Famous indicated that she was set to follow her mother in taking the film industry by storm. In the midst of a whirlwind schedule of fashion shoots and awards shows, she made an appearance in the romantic war drama The Four Feathers in 2002. Turning out to be a box-office failure, Hudson fired back with the surefire hit as she starred opposite quirky heartthrob Matthew McConaughey in the romantic comedy How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003). She continued to establish herself as a fully-fledged actress starring in subsequent productions like Raising Helen (2004), The Skeleton Key (2005), You, Me and Dupree (2006), Fool's Gold (2008) and Bride Wars (2009). As of most recent, she could be seen in the musical comedy-drama television series Glee as Cassandra July.","Kate Hudson is a highly acclaimed American actress with an impressive net worth of $38 million dollars.

Last week, Shelton caused an uproar when he sent a cryptic tweet about ""karma"" just as reports claimed that his ex-wife Miranda Lambert was dating a married man.  ""Been taking the high road for a long time.. I almost gave up. But I can finally see something on the horizon up there!! Wait!! Could it be?! Yep!! It’s karma!!"" Shelton tweeted after multiple outlets reported Lambert began dating married Turnpike Troubadours front man, Evan Felker.  But according to Lambert's ex-boyfriend Jeff Allen, Shelton is not as innocent as he's trying to seem.  Allen tweeted and deleted a post calling out Shelton for romancing Allen's then-girlfriend Lambert while Shelton was still married to his first wife, Kaynette Williams, in 2006.  ""You know, I’ve always given you the benefit of the doubt and chalked it up to just being human, but you must be one arrogant SOB to pop off something like this, when I know damn good and well you were cheating on your wife and Miranda was cheating on me when you two started up,"" Allen wrote in a since-deleted tweet, according to Us Weekly.  ""I kept my mouth shut for 13 years. Sorry, his karma tweet rubbed me wrong. All of this is pointless,"" he added.  Allen told RadarOnline.com, ""I’m sure Miranda did [Blake] dirty just like she did me, but he wasn’t thinking about me when he was cheating with her, so I don’t know why he thinks it's karma.""  He added that he does not harbor bad feelings toward Lambert and said she ""was a loving, caring person and a good girlfriend.""  Reps for Lambert and Shelton did not return Fox News' requests for comment.  It's been reported that Lambert and Shelton's romance began as an affair but both singers have denied this in the past. They became engaged in May 2010 and married a year later in Texas. The country singers announced their divorce after four years of marriage in July 2015.

Nelson, who still goes by her married name on social media, shared a tearful selfie on Thursday with the caption, ""PSA: If Staci Felker can make it through this week, so can you.""","Blake Shelton appears to be entangled in a complex web of personal relationships that tests the concept of karma. Recent events have sparked controversy surrounding the country singer, as he sent out a cryptic tweet referencing karma just as news broke that his ex-wife Miranda Lambert was allegedly involved with a married man. In his tweet, Shelton proclaimed his adherence to the high road for a significant period of time, yet expressed a newfound belief in the workings of karma. This statement was made after multiple outlets reported that Lambert had begun dating Evan Felker, the married frontman of Turnpike Troubadours.

However, Lambert's ex-boyfriend Jeff Allen has shed light on Shelton's past, asserting that the singer is not as blameless as he may want to appear. Allen recently tweeted, but later deleted, a post calling out Shelton for engaging in a romantic relationship with Lambert while Shelton himself was still married to his first wife, Kaynette Williams, back in 2006. Allen's tweet revealed his discontent with Shelton's audacity in invoking karma, stating, ""You know, I’ve always given you the benefit of the doubt and chalked it up to just being human, but you must be one arrogant SOB to pop off something like this when I know damn good and well you were cheating on your wife and Miranda was cheating on me when you two started up."" Despite holding his silence for over a decade, Allen felt compelled to share his frustrations, asserting that the notion of karma held no relevance for Shelton's actions towards him.

Allen's comments serve to shed light on the complexities of the situation, but he also acknowledged that his feelings towards Lambert remain positive. He described her as a loving, caring person and a good girlfriend, indicating his lack of animosity towards her in light of their past. Representatives for both Lambert and Shelton did not provide any comment in response to Fox News' inquiries.

Reports have surfaced regarding the origin of Lambert and Shelton's relationship, with allegations of it beginning as an affair. However, both singers have consistently denied these claims in the past. Their romantic journey commenced with an engagement in May 2010, followed by their wedding in Texas the following year. Unfortunately, after four years of marriage, the two musicians announced their divorce in July 2015.

Recent developments indicate that Lambert, who recently ended her two-year relationship with Anderson East, began a romantic involvement with Felker when his band joined her ""Livin’ Like Hippies"" tour in January. It is worth noting that Felker was married to global strategist Staci Nelson in September 2016. However, it appears their relationship has reached a pivotal juncture, as Felker filed for divorce on February 16th, followed by Nelson's filing 12 days later.

In particular, Stefani's jealousy over Shelton's friendship with The Voice winner, Chloe Kohanski, became a breaking point in their relationship.

She jests that Ruby is quite content with her constant presence, allowing her to lay and stare at Cuoco for hours on end. Cuoco jokingly inquires if this is Ruby's ultimate dream come true.

Contrary to popular belief, Cuoco clarifies that the surgery was not the result of a spontaneous injury. Rather, it was a premeditated decision she made over a year ago. She explains through her Instagram Story that she had injured her shoulder more than a year ago, and though immediate surgery was not required, she cunningly planned it to coincide with her wedding. Cuoco humorously adds that she knew she would have a ""babysitter"" in the form of her newlywed husband, Karl Cook.

Taking into account the length of the recovery process, which could extend up to six weeks, Cuoco mentions her intentions to keep a low profile during this period. Playfully panning the camera towards Cook, she exclaims that she is now confined to a sizable cast, and temporarily unable to engage in horse-related activities. Cuoco adds a jestful remark, hoping that they both survive the recovery process unscathed.

Cuoco initially unveiled news of her surgery on Thursday, alongside a selfie taken at the hospital. Expressing her gratitude for the support and love she has received, she anticipates that her husband, Cook, will provide entertaining updates throughout her recovery. True to her expectations, Cook promptly posts a photo of Cuoco during her hospital stay, humorously referring to her ""shoulder surgery honeymoon"" and emphasizing her unique post-operation glow.

gossipcop-6048462622,1,1,"Some reports suggest Ben Affleck and girlfriend Lindsay Shookus' relationship may have been going on even while they were still married to their respective spouses. A source tells ET that Affleck first saw Shookus while he was still married to Jennifer Garner, and Shookus was married to Kevin Miller -- a fellow Saturday Night Live producer. According to the source, Affleck and Shookus were seeing one another as far back as late 2014, months before news broke that he had an alleged fling with his children's nanny, Christine Ouzounian. Affleck's reported dalliance with the nanny happened in the summer of 2015, and was short-lived, our source says. However, a source close to 44-year-old Affleck disputes that the actor and Shookus got together while both were married, although the two were friendly. The source says the two got romantic after his separation from Garner in 2015.

Affleck last appeared on SNL in May 2013. Interestingly enough, Garner made an appearance during Affleck's monologue at the time, to celebrate the actor hosting the show for the fifth time. The two joked about Affleck's Best Picture acceptance speech for Argo at the Oscars, in which he said that his and Garner's marriage took ""work."" Affleck publicly thanked Garner for all her support onstage, and the two sweetly shared a kiss. One month later, eyewitnesses reportedly spotted Affleck and Shookus looking flirty at The Heat premiere after-party in NYC. ""He definitely looked interested in her,"" a partygoer told People at the time. The two later left together with other friends and headed to the nearby Mandarin Oriental hotel bar. Over the years, their relationship allegedly continued, though a source close to Affleck says the two did not get romantic until after his separation from Garner in 2015. Affleck and Shookus ""full-on had an affair,"" claims a source cited by People. ""They would fly back and forth, but he would mostly visit her in New York. They didn't hide."" ""Both of them were married at the time. They were having secret rendezvous every time he came in to New York City and other places, too,"" claims a second source the magazine quotes. ""Both of them were cheating on their spouses so they were very careful about it,"" the source alleges.

This will be our only comment on this private, family matter. Thank you for understanding."" July 2015 -- The nanny scandal Us Weekly broke the story on July 29, claiming that Affleck had secretly been dating Ouzounian, and that the two frequently texted and emailed after she was let go as his children's nanny. Earlier that month,","Some reports suggest that Ben Affleck and Lindsay Shookus began their relationship while they were still married to their respective spouses. According to a source, Affleck first encountered Shookus when he was still married to Jennifer Garner and Shookus was married to Kevin Miller, a fellow producer on Saturday Night Live. The source reveals that Affleck and Shookus were seeing each other as early as late 2014, several months before news of Affleck's alleged fling with his children's nanny, Christine Ouzounian, broke in the summer of 2015. However, a source close to Affleck disputes these claims, asserting that the actor and Shookus did not become romantically involved until after his separation from Garner in 2015. It is important to note that both Affleck and Shookus were married at the time, but our sources suggest that they were discreet about their relationship and took precautions to keep it hidden. 

A timeline of their alleged relationship reveals that Affleck and Shookus reportedly started seeing each other in 2013, two years prior to Affleck and Garner's separation. One month after Affleck's monologue on a Saturday Night Live episode in May 2013, eyewitnesses apparently observed Affleck and Shookus looking flirty at The Heat premiere after-party in New York City. Over the years, their relationship supposedly continued, but it was not until 2015 that they became involved romantically, according to a source close to Affleck. This source claims that Affleck and Shookus had an affair, frequently meeting up in New York City and other locations. 

In 2015, Garner and Miller reportedly discovered Affleck and Shookus' alleged relationship at the same time. However, a source close to Affleck asserts that Shookus was not the cause of their marriage's end, claiming that they faced numerous other problems. Affleck and Garner officially announced their separation on June 30, 2015, emphasizing their commitment to co-parenting their children and requesting privacy. 

The nanny scandal involving Affleck and Ouzounian emerged in July 2015. Us Weekly reported that Affleck and Ouzounian were secretly dating, with frequent texting and emailing occurring even after Ouzounian was no longer employed as the children's nanny. Affleck's representative denied these allegations, calling them baseless and untrue. 

Affleck and Garner filed for divorce in April 2017 after two years of separation. They have consistently emphasized their children's well-being and continue to co-parent. In July 2017, Affleck and Shookus were photographed together for the first time, and sources suggest that their relationship is going well. Shookus, who has experience in the entertainment industry, understands the expectations and limitations of a relationship with someone in the public eye, which reportedly puts Affleck at ease. Both Affleck and Garner, as well as Shookus and her ex-husband from her previous marriage, are said to maintain amicable relationships despite their separations."

A new report from OK! is claiming that things might start heating up between Robert Pattinson, 32, and Sienna Miller, 36. The two actors “have been close for years,” an insider tells the magazine, adding that “they’ve always had a great connection, but one of them was always with someone else, so it stayed platonic.” However, both of them aren’t currently seeing anyone now. “Now that they’re both single, the door is open for them to give this a real shot,” the source continued.

gossipcop-7885025406,1,0,"More than a month has passed since Matt Lauer was fired from the Today show, and his former longtime colleague, Katie Couric, is now opening up about the former NBC anchor’s shocking dismissal.  “The whole thing has been very painful for me,” Couric, 61, tells PEOPLE. “The accounts I’ve read and heard have been disturbing, distressing and disorienting and it’s completely unacceptable that any woman at the Today show experienced this kind of treatment.  “I had no idea this was going on during my tenure or after I left,” she continued. “I think I speak for many of my former colleagues when I say this was not the Matt we knew. Matt was a kind and generous colleague who treated me with respect. In fact, a joke I once made on late-night television was just that, because it was completely contrary to our brother-sister relationship. It’s still very upsetting. I really admire the way Savannah [Guthrie] and Hoda [Kotb] and the entire Today show staff have handled a very difficult situation.”  The late-night show joke that Couric refers to is when she said on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen in 2012 that Lauer “pinches me on the ass a lot.” A clip of the comment made the rounds online in the wake of Lauer’s firing.  Couric spent 15 years co-hosting NBC’s Today show with Lauer, 60, but left in May 2006 to anchor the CBS Evening News.  NBC/Getty  Lauer was fired at the end of November by NBC News after the network received a “detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior,” with reason to believe “this may not have been an isolated incident.” Women have also anonymously accused him of sexual harassment and assault in reports published by Variety and The New York Times.  Following his firing, which was announced live on Today by Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb, Lauer addressed the original allegations in a statement.  “There are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions,” he said, in part. “To the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry. As I am writing this, I realize the depth of the damage and disappointment I have left behind at home and at NBC.”  Although her PEOPLE interview is the first time Couric has spoken in detail about Lauer’s exit, she briefly broke her silence about the scandal on social media in December.  In a short response to an Instagram user, who called Couric out for not publicly addressing the scandal, the veteran journalist said, “It’s incredibly upsetting and I will say something when I’m ready to. Thanks for your interest.”  RELATED VIDEO: Women of Hollywood Attend Golden Globes Together in Support of the Time’s Up Movement  The claims against Lauer came as hundreds of women and men — including Rose McGowan, Ashley Judd, Terry Crews and Anthony Rapp — have publicly came forward about alleged sexual misconduct at the hands of powerful men in Hollywood, including Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey.  The movement inspired the new Time’s Up initiative and legal defense fund that was created to help victims of sexual misconduct pursue legal action against their perpetrators. Time’s Up was a major focus at this year’s Golden Globes, where almost all the famous attendees wore black to raise awareness about the cause.  “I think it was really moving to see so many women support each other and demand change, not only for themselves, but for mistreated and marginalized women in all kinds of industries,” Couric tells PEOPLE about Time’s Up. “Clearly we are witnessing a sea change and a long overdue course correction.”  She also said that one of the new of the episodes of her upcoming six-part documentary Nat Geo series will focus on harassment women have experienced in their workplaces.  “One of my Nat Geo episodes explores the various obstacles that are holding women back in Hollywood, Silicon Valley and beyond,” she says. “I just interviewed Elisabeth Moss about this. Harassment is just one part of the equation.”  RELATED VIDEO: Hoda Kotb and ","More than a month has elapsed since Matt Lauer was terminated from the Today show, and his former longtime colleague, Katie Couric, has now decided to share her thoughts on the shocking dismissal of the former NBC anchor. Couric, 61, expresses her distress over the distressing and disorienting accounts she has come across regarding Lauer's actions towards women at the Today show, stating it is completely unacceptable. During her tenure and even after her departure, Couric claims to have had no knowledge of such behavior. She emphasizes that the Matt she knew was a kind and respectful colleague, contrary to the troubling allegations. Despite the turmoil, Couric admires the way Savannah Guthrie, Hoda Kotb, and the entire Today show staff have handled this difficult situation. 

The late-night show joke Couric refers to occurred in 2012 on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, where she jokingly mentioned that Lauer would frequently pinch her on the backside. This comment resurfaced online following Lauer's firing. 

Having co-hosted NBC's Today show with Lauer for 15 years, Couric left in May 2006 to anchor the CBS Evening News. 

In November, Lauer was fired by NBC News due to a ""detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior,"" with indications that this may not have been an isolated incident. Anonymous reports in Variety and The New York Times have also accused him of sexual harassment and assault. Lauer addressed the initial allegations in a statement, expressing deep sorrow and regret for the pain he has caused others. 

While this PEOPLE interview marks the first time Couric delves into the details surrounding Lauer's departure, she briefly acknowledged the scandal on social media in December, mentioning that it is incredibly upsetting and hinting that she will speak out when ready. 

The accusations against Lauer emerged alongside numerous others against powerful individuals in Hollywood, including Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey. This prompted the creation of the Time's Up initiative and legal defense fund, which aims to support victims of sexual misconduct in pursuing legal action against their perpetrators. The movement was prominent at this year's Golden Globes, where attendees wore black to raise awareness. Couric expresses her admiration for the solidarity amongst women and the demand for change in various industries, seeing it as a long overdue course correction. 

Furthermore, Couric shares that an episode in her upcoming Nat Geo documentary series will focus on workplace harassment experienced by women in Hollywood, Silicon Valley, and other sectors. She had recently interviewed Elisabeth Moss on the subject, highlighting that harassment represents just one facet of the challenges women face."

But the male player ranked 701 in the world - Dmitry Tursunov - believes he could beat her.  Speaking to US radio station NPR, seven-time Grand Slam champion McEnroe said of former world number one Williams, who has won an Open-era record 23 Grand Slams: ""If she played the men's circuit she'd be, like, 700 in the world.""  He qualified the comments by saying: ""That doesn't mean I don't think Serena is an incredible player, and I suppose anything's possible; maybe at some point a women's tennis player can be better than anybody.""  But he added: ""I just haven't seen that in any other sport, and I haven't seen it in tennis. If she had to just play the men's circuit, it would be an entirely different story.""  Williams later responded on Twitter: ""Dear John, I adore and respect you but please please keep me out of your statements that are not factually based.  ""I've never played anyone ranked ""there"" nor do I have time. Respect me and my privacy as I'm trying to have a baby. Good day sir.""  Williams, 35, won her 23rd Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in January. It later transpired she was pregnant at the time  'She is pregnant, and I'm not'  Tursunov, 34, was once ranked as high as 20th in the world.  The Russian told BBC World Service Sport he did not think McEnroe was ""trying to talk women's tennis down"" but said ""the reality"" was that ""men are stronger in general"".  ""I would hope that I would win against Serena,"" he added.  ""It would be a similar argument to: who would run faster, the fastest woman or the fastest man? Tennis is becoming more and more a physical sport, so it's going to be hard for a woman to beat the men.  ""It's not black and white, there are lots of factors to take into account. Physically I might not be in the best shape of my life but as an overall package I'm much better than my ranking would suggest. She is pregnant, and I'm not.  ""I've never heard John say anything absolutely stupid - he knows his stuff. What he said about her being an incredible player is correct - explosive, powerful and she puts in a lot of work. But I would hope that I would win.""  Battle of the sexes  A crowd of 30,000 watched Billie Jean King take on Bobby Riggs in Houston in 1973  Tennis matches between men and women have occurred before, mostly notably back in 1973 when Billie Jean King took on fellow American Bobby Riggs.  Riggs, the world number one in the 1940s, retired in 1951 and at the age of 55 believed he could beat any of the top female players.  King originally declined to play Riggs and Australian Margaret Court - at the time the top female player in the world - stepped in. Riggs won 6-2 6-1.  But later that year, the top ranked women's player King - 26 years younger than Riggs at 29 - took him on in an exhibition match at the Houston Astrodome and won 6-4 6-3 6-3.  A third 'Battle of the Sexes' match took in 1992 between American former world number one Jimmy Connors, aged 40 at the time, and Czech and American Martina Navratilova, who was 35.  The match took place under special rules to make it more competitive - Connors was allowed only one serve per point, and Navratilova was allowed to hit into half the doubles court. Connors won 7-5 6-2.","Serena Williams, the esteemed former world number one and holder of 23 Grand Slam titles, has strongly disputed claims made by John McEnroe regarding her hypothetical performance on the men's tennis circuit. McEnroe suggested that if Williams were to compete against male players, she would struggle to place higher than 700th in the world rankings. However, Dmitry Tursunov, the current male player ranked 701st, expressed confidence in his ability to defeat her. In an interview with US radio station NPR, McEnroe clarified his remarks, emphasizing his respect and admiration for Williams while acknowledging the possibility of exceptional female talent surpassing their male counterparts in the future. Yet, he maintained that based on his observations across various sports, including tennis, he has not witnessed such a phenomenon. Williams later responded to McEnroe's comments on Twitter, politely requesting that he refrain from sharing unfounded opinions about her abilities and respect her privacy, particularly as she is currently focusing on starting a family. At the age of 35, Williams secured her 23rd Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in January, unknowingly while pregnant. Tursunov, a former top 20 male player, remarked that he did not believe McEnroe intended to belittle women's tennis, but rather highlighted the physical advantage men generally possess. He expressed his belief that he could win against Williams in a hypothetical match, drawing a parallel to the debate over who would run faster, the fastest woman or the fastest man. Tursunov acknowledged that factors beyond physicality influence match outcomes and noted that despite his lower ranking, he considers himself a formidable opponent. Reflecting on the history of gender-based tennis matches, the famous ""Battle of the Sexes"" between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs in 1973 stands out. Riggs, a retired former world number one, believed he could defeat any top female player at the age of 55. Initially, King declined his challenge, leading Margaret Court, the number one female player, to step in, only to lose to Riggs. However, King later faced Riggs in an exhibition match and emerged victorious. Another notable match occurred in 1992 between tennis greats Jimmy Connors and Martina Navratilova, where Connors prevailed following adjusted rules to level the playing field."

Brothers, James Stanford Poore, 32, and Cedric Dwayne Poore, 39, were arrested and booked on four complaints each of first degree murder, Chief Chuck Jordan said.  On Monday, January 7, 2013, twin sisters Rebeika Powell and Kayetie Powell-Melchor, 23; Misty Nunley, 33, and Julie Jackson, 55 were found shot in the head, with their hands tied behind their backs inside a south Tulsa apartment, police say. A 3-year-old boy was also found inside the apartment, unharmed.  Chief Jordan said the murders were not gang-related. According to arrest reports, witnesses told investigators that the brothers left an apartment in the same building at Fairmont Terrace Apartments, near 61st and Peoria, saying they were going to pull a ""lick"" at the victims' apartment.  Witnesses told police the brothers returned about 20 minutes later with a bag full of drugs, cash, and jewelry. According to the report, James Poore told the witnesses that he shot one of the victims because she could identify him and that Cedric shot the other three. The witnesses told investigators the brothers split the money and that Cedric Poore took the jewelry to pawn.    When he was interviewed Wednesday, James Poore confirmed to investigators that he knew one of the victims and that he was in the apartment where the witnesses placed him. Before invoking his right to remain silent, he told investigators he knew one of the victims had used and sold illegal drugs and that Cedric drove a black van to the apartment the day of the murders.    The arrest report shows Cedric Poore denied being in the apartment the day of the murders and refused to speak to investigators any more.  Chief Jordan said the brothers both stayed at Fairmont Terrace Apartments. The property manager there told News On 6 that neither of them are on a lease.  Cedric Poore has been in Tulsa County jail on a traffic violation since January 14, and James Poore was arrested Wednesday morning. Department of Corrections records show both James and Cedric have been previously convicted and incarcerated for robbery with a firearm.  Chief Jordan said more arrests may still be made.  Mayor Dewey Bartlett released a statement Wednesday afternoon, in response to the news of the arrests:    ""The Tulsa Police Department is known for their quick efforts of finding perpetrators and they indeed lived up to their stellar reputation for this case. I have the utmost confidence in Chief Chuck Jordan and the Tulsa Police Department and I knew they would bring in those involved with this hideous quadruple murder in very short order.

A three-year-old boy, who was also found in the apartment, was unharmed.

Chief Jordan stated that the motive behind these horrifying murders was not related to any gang activity. Information gathered from witnesses revealed that the suspects left their own apartment in the same building as Fairmont Terrace Apartments, situated near 61st and Peoria, with the intention of carrying out a criminal act at the victims' residence. Approximately 20 minutes later, the witnesses reported seeing the brothers return with a bag containing drugs, cash, and jewelry. One witness informed investigators that James Poore shared his motivation for shooting one of the victims, fearing she could recognize him, while Cedric Poore was responsible for shooting the other three victims. The witnesses further disclosed that the brothers divided the stolen money between them, with Cedric Poore pawning the stolen jewelry.

During the interview on Wednesday, James Poore admitted to investigators that he knew one of the victims and was present at the apartment complex at the time specified by the witnesses. He also provided the information that one of the victims had a history of using and selling illegal drugs, and described how Cedric had arrived at the apartment that day driving a black van. Shortly after making these statements, James Poore invoked his right to remain silent. In contrast, Cedric Poore denied being present in the apartment on the day of the murders and declined any further communication with investigators.

Chief Jordan revealed that both brothers were residents of Fairmont Terrace Apartments. However, the property manager confirmed that neither of them were on the lease agreement. Cedric Poore had been confined in Tulsa County jail since January 14 for a traffic violation, while James Poore was apprehended on Wednesday morning. Records from the Department of Corrections indicate that both brothers had been previously incarcerated for armed robbery.

Chief Jordan concluded the press conference by mentioning the possibility of additional arrests in connection with this case. Mayor Dewey Bartlett also released a statement in response to the news of the arrests, commending the Tulsa Police Department for their swift action. He expressed his unwavering faith in Chief Chuck Jordan and the entire police force, highlighting the importance of public assistance in solving such heinous crimes."

Kendall explained that even the crew members can't help but be moved to tears when one of the girls opens up.

The personal connection between the family and their crew is undeniable. Kendall acknowledges the intimate relationship they share, stating that when someone cries on the show, it often prompts tears from the camera operators and producers as well. Kim reinforces this sentiment, emphasizing that these crew members witness every detail of their lives. The crew size can vary, ranging from a single person with an iPhone to a team of 30 individuals, all diligently observing their every move.

Anyone present on set during Kendall's controversial Pepsi advertisement would have also been privy to her reaction amidst the criticism she faced. While the public has not been provided with evidence of how Kendall responded to the backlash (as she deleted all related content from her social media and never made an official statement), Kim sheds some light on the situation. According to Kim, Kendall never allowed herself to be shown crying on camera. Despite the inner turmoil she experienced, Kendall made a conscious decision to appear resilient in the media. Kim, however, believed that Kendall should have spoken up, viewing the situation as unjust.

Ultimately, it appears that the only individuals who truly know the extent of Kendall's emotions during that time are the crew members who witnessed it firsthand."

The singer has previously spoken about her battle with the disorder on social media.  Fibromyalgia causes widespread pain and is not curable.  In 2016, Lady Gaga revealed an Instagram post is 2016 that she suffers from ""chronic pain"" but never gave more details. But in her upcoming documentary, ""Gaga: Five Foot Two,"" the singer and actress dives a little deeper into the disease she's been battling for some time.  The singer recently tweeted that the chronic pain she deals with is fibromyalgia, a disorder that is more common than people may think. In the tweet, she wrote that she wants to, "" help raise awareness and connect people who have it,"" CNN reports.  Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain disorder that causes tenderness to touch or pain over the body.  According to the National Fibromyalgia & Chronic Pain Association, the disease can vary in intensity and affects people ""physically, mentally, and socially."" People suffering from this disorder, which often manifests itself in adolescence or young adulthood, feel more pain than would be typically expected. Because of this pain, a few common symptoms include fatigue, tenderness, sleep disorders, memory problems, depression, and stiffness.  The foundation also reports that 10 million Americans suffer from fibromyalgia with a ratio of eight to two ratio, women over men.  There is no cure for this pain, and it is a lifelong condition.  The disease can occur on its own but has also been linked to stress, repetitive injuries, and other diseases like Lupus, according to the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases. Researchers are working to determine definitively what causes people to develop this pain in the hopes of finding a cure or better treatment options.  Healthline reports that treatment typically goes beyond medication and focuses on improving quality of life through self-care and lifestyle changes. Medication options vary from antidepressants and sleep aids to pain relievers and narcolepsy drugs.  Other celebs have opened up about their struggle with chronic pain or fibromyalgia.

According to ABC, other stars that have suffered from chronic pain include Paula Abdul, George Clooney, and Tobey Maguire.  In a press conference, Gaga said that the ""pain is a microphone"" and it ""does me no good unless I transform it into something that is,"" Variety reports. Here's hoping ""Gaga: Five Foot Two,"" which will be available on September 22 on Netflix, inspires others suffering to transform the pain.","Lady Gaga's latest documentary delves into her personal experiences with chronic pain and fibromyalgia, shedding light on a disorder that is more common than people may realize. Fibromyalgia, a chronic pain disorder, is characterized by widespread tenderness and pain throughout the body. While it is not curable, 10 million Americans, predominantly women, are affected by this lifelong condition, as reported by the National Fibromyalgia & Chronic Pain Association. 

The documentary aims to raise awareness and connect individuals who are dealing with fibromyalgia. Lady Gaga, who previously disclosed her struggles with chronic pain on social media, now explores the depths of this disease in ""Gaga: Five Foot Two"". This disorder, which commonly manifests itself during adolescence or young adulthood, results in heightened sensitivity to pain.

gossipcop-8106461875,1,0,"Absurdly Driven looks at the world of business with a skeptical eye and a firmly rooted tongue in cheek.  People are always saying unflattering things about you.  Even if you're the Pope.  The only time it can affect you, however, is when you hear about it.  Or, worse, if someone makes the unpleasant comment directly to you.  Which brings us, quite naturally, to Twitter.  Here's a place that's just too perfect for the nasty, uncontrolled insult.  You can hide behind your egg and toss Bons-Molotovs at anyone you choose.  Some people choose Kim Kardashian.  She's an easy target.  Her life seems effortless. She's painfully wealthy, with a TV show, branded products left and right and an appearance fee surely only rivaled by Hillary Clinton.  Hers is such a cushy life that she can listen to Kanye West any time she wants.  Small wonder, then, that a Twitter user called Kevin James offered a wry dig at her countenance.  Is it me, or is @KimKardashian Sooo Self-absorbed.. even when she's saying Nothing.. lol.. & I Like the Kardashians #KUWTK -- Kevin James (@kevinjames4good) January 22, 2018  If you've ever been attacked on Twitter, you have choices.  You can reply aggressively. This is rarely worth it with a troll.  You can ignore it and even block the person who directed their bile your way.  You can wait for your own fans to descend upon this poor individual and shred him from tweet to tweet.  Or, you can be splendidly disarming.  This last path was the one taken by Kardashian.  No it's not you, I totally am! https://t.co/9ZxgPyVkko -- Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) January 22, 2018  Not everyone can pull this off with a straight face.  But here, Kardashian showed she understood the emotional essence of her interlocutor.  His biggest problem was surely that he isn't Kim Kardashian.  So she brought him onto her side with something so blessedly charming that it not only made her seem entirely self-aware -- rather than merely self-absorbed -- but also must have enticed a chuckle from Kevin James himself.  Indeed, it incited James to respond with quite considered contrition.  @KimKardashian Listen: altho my tweet came across ""seemingly"" disrespectful, it was just a thought/tweet worthy reaction.. lol... No DisRespect.. .. & I Appreciate ur Sense of humor, & @cassbrunelle14 for calling me out.. lol.. props to the Kardashian Empire -- Kevin James (@kevinjames4good) January 22, 2018  And so, without a word of insult, without so much as a miffed gesture, Kardashian took a situation that could have been emotionally straining and turned it into one the most pleasant feelings we have: laughter.  We'd all love to have that skill.  On truly good days, we find it.  On most other days, we walk away from a tense situation and only then do we start kicking ourselves that we didn't react a different way.  Harnessing it surely takes practice. A lot of practice.  Something Kardashian has surely done.","Absurdly Driven, a column that approaches the business world with a discerning perspective and a lighthearted touch, delves into the subject of public criticism. In today's society, no one is exempt from receiving unflattering comments, not even esteemed figures like the Pope. The impact of such remarks, however, is solely determined by one's awareness of them or, worse yet, when confronted with unpleasant comments directly. This brings us to the realm of Twitter, a platform notorious for the uncontrolled dissemination of insults. From behind the guise of anonymity, users can launch verbal attacks on anyone they choose. Predictably, some individuals choose to target easy marks such as Kim Kardashian. Celebrities like her, seemingly leading effortlessly luxurious lives with their wealth, TV shows, and branded products, become prime recipients of malicious criticism. 

Recently, a Twitter user named Kevin James took a mild shot at Kardashian's persona, evoking the notion that she exudes self-absorption even without speaking. James humorously expressed his thoughts while simultaneously confessing his fondness for the Kardashian family. 

When faced with such attacks on Twitter, users have several choices in how to respond. Reacting aggressively to trolls rarely proves worth the effort. Ignoring and blocking those who spew negativity is an option, as is relying on one's fans to come to their defense. However, there is an alternative path – one that is disarmingly gracious. Kardashian, adeptly navigating this path, responded with a self-deprecating tweet that cleverly captured the emotional essence of her interlocutor's quip. By doing so, she portrayed herself as more self-aware than self-absorbed. Additionally, her response likely earned a laugh even from Kevin James himself. Appropriately, James reciprocated her disarming approach, expressing thoughtful contrition and appreciation for Kardashian's sense of humor.

Thus, rather than succumbing to the emotional strain that public criticism can bring, Kardashian transformed the situation into a lighthearted exchange, infusing it with one of life's greatest joys: laughter. This skill of turning tense situations into pleasant ones is a coveted trait that most of us aspire to possess. On the rare occasions when we achieve this feat, it brings us immense satisfaction. In other instances, we often reflect on encounters and wish we had responded differently. This ability to harness the power of humor and charm requires extensive practice, an art that Kardashian has undoubtedly mastered."

The country superstar opened up about his romance with the No Doubt frontwoman in a new interview with Billboard magazine.  As previously reported, Shelton told Stefani that he was splitting from Lambert during a meeting with their Voice coworkers. The “Misery” singer, who was new to the team at the time, got emotional.  “I won’t forget that day. I looked over at Gwen — who I didn’t really know — and she had these huge tears in her eyes. I thought, ‘Wow, she feels super bad for me!’” Shelton recalled. “She didn’t tell me much, because we didn’t know each other at the time, but she said, ‘I’m going through something very similar to what you’re going through. I understand. And I hate it.’”  Stefani was dealing with her own breakup at the time with Gavin Rossdale. (As Us Weekly exclusively revealed, the Bush rocker was cheating on her with their children’s nanny, Mindy Mann.) They announced they were ending their 13-year marriage in August 2015, one month after Shelton and Lambert announced they were divorcing after four years.  The “Came Here to Forget” singer and Stefani leaned on each other for support during the difficult time. The closer they got, the more Shelton saw Stefani in a new light.  “That’s kind of how our friendship and bond started, that day. It went from that, to checking in on each other once a week through email — ‘This s–t happened to me, what happened to you?’ — to maybe three times a week, then every day, to ‘Hey, here’s my phone number if you ever want to text,’” Shelton told Billboard. “Next thing I know, I wake up and she’s all I care about, and I’m ­wondering if she feels the same about me.”  “Gwen saved my life,” he added. “Who else on earth could understand going through a high-profile divorce from another musician? You can’t even imagine the similarities in our divorces.”  The two teamed up professionally too. Shelton included their collaborative track, “Go Ahead and Break My Heart,” on his 12th studio album, If I’m Honest.  “When we recorded the vocals for some of these songs, I was only six months removed from when all the crap went down,” Shelton said of his split from Lambert. “When you have a broken heart — at least, when I do — you got to get it out of your system. You want people to sympathize with you. I was at rock bottom, in the middle of hell.”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!

The two musicians found solace in each other's company, gradually building a strong bond of friendship and support. As their connection grew deeper, Shelton began to see Stefani in a new light. Their friendship evolved from occasional emails to more frequent check-ins and eventually daily communication. Shelton admitted that Stefani had become his top priority and he wondered if his feelings were reciprocated. Shelton expressed his gratitude to Stefani, acknowledging that she saved him during this challenging period of his life. The understanding and shared experiences they both had as musicians going through high-profile divorces were unparalleled. Not only did they rely on each other for emotional support, but they also collaborated on a song, ""Go Ahead and Break My Heart,"" which Shelton included on his album If I'm Honest. Shelton confessed that their recording sessions occurred just six months after his divorce, when he was at his lowest point and in desperate need of catharsis. Overall, Shelton's heartfelt recounting of Stefani's impact on his life stands as a testament to the transformative power of friendship and understanding during times of adversity."

In addition to her net worth, she has a highly coveted position in the world of magazine publishing.

Her career began in the world of fashion before moving into journalism, largely at the behest of her parents. In the year 1970, Wintour was hired on as an editorial assistant for the new Harper's & Queen fashion magazine. Even at this early stage of her career, Wintour divulged to coworkers that she had the desire to edit Vogue, a desire that would grow to be fulfilled nearly 20 years later. Wintour introduced sweeping changes to Vogue from her first issue forward. Many of these changes could be seen right on the cover. Wintour favored more naturalistic photography of lesser-known models outside, as opposed to the tight headshots the magazine had previously favored. Additionally, Wintour's first Vogue cover was also the first to feature a model wearing jeans, with the added bonus of wearing a bejeweled T-shirt valued at around $10,000.

In 1970, Wintour commenced her career as an editorial assistant for the newly launched Harper's & Queen fashion magazine. Even at that nascent stage, her aspirations of editing Vogue were evident, eventually fulfilled almost two decades later.

Wintour, from her inaugural issue onwards, swiftly implemented significant transformations within the pages of Vogue. Notably, these modifications were apparent right on the magazine's cover. Departing from the magazine's previous preference for tightly framed headshots, Wintour favored a more naturalistic style of photography, showcasing lesser-known models in outdoor settings. Moreover, Wintour's debut Vogue cover shattered conventions as it featured a model clad in jeans, the first of its kind, accentuated by a lavishly adorned T-shirt valued at approximately $10,000.

This sentiment, however, did not reflect the warm and affectionate dynamic observed between Chmerkovskiy, 37, and Lachey, 36, behind the scenes during the live show. During the commercial break before their performance, Lachey and Chmerkovskiy took the opportunity to interact with Lachey's two older children, who were seated in the front row. Chmerkovskiy then guided Lachey to the center of the ballroom to rehearse their routine. After rehearsing, Lachey returned to her children while Chmerkovskiy playfully joined her moments later, eliciting laughter from Lachey. Once the show resumed after the advertisements, they assumed their positions. Even after receiving their scores of 24 out of 30, fans continued to remark on their demeanor, perceiving it as uncomfortable. However, behind the scenes, Chmerkovskiy was seen comforting Lachey, who appeared to have hoped for higher scores. This gave credence to the rumors circulating about their strained relationship. Despite tension in the rehearsal room, sources divulged to PEOPLE that during Monday's emotionally charged elimination, Lachey sought solace in Chmerkovskiy's arms. This occurred when it was announced that her husband, Nick Lachey, was not in danger of being eliminated for the first time in three weeks. Chmerkovskiy embraced her and provided support until the entire cast came together to bid farewell to Gleb Savchenko and Sasha Pieterse. Chmerkovskiy and Lachey will return to the ballroom on Monday (8 p.m. ET) for Movie Night on the ABC reality dance competition."
gossipcop-5866775064,1,1,"On the same day rumors spread that there’s trouble in paradise for Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani, another shocking report claims Miranda Lambert is desperately trying to meet up with her ex!  It’s been more than two years since Blake Shelton, 40, and Miranda Lambert, 33, ended their marriage, but she’s finally ready to sit down and hash things out, according to a new report. Amidst new rumors that Blake is having trouble in his relationship with Gwen Stefani, 47, an insider tells InTouch that Miranda wants to confront her ex to finally get closure. “It needs to be done,” the source tells the mag. “There’s still a lot of unfinished business between [Miranda] and Blake. She needs to look straight into Blake’s eyes, ask certain questions, and get answers.”  There are no plans set for this meeting to actually take place just yet, but the mag claims that if it does happen, Miranda plans to go in with a “clear head,” although that might not be so easy. “This could get heated,” the insider admits. “As soon as the emotions come up, [Miranda] may lose it.” This doesn’t mean the 33-year-old wants to get back together with her ex, though — actually, it’s just the opposite. She’s very happy with her man, Anderson East, 29, but feels a face-to-face with Blake is what she needs to fully be ready to commit to another relationship, according to the source.  “She feels that [she and Blake] have both grown so much since their divorce that meeting up is essential for them to have healthy relationships in the future,” InTouch’s insider says. “Who knows, maybe this meeting with Blake will have them walk away as friends. Either way, they’ll definitely be in a better place.”  As for the rumored trouble between Blake and Gwen, we’re going to take that report (from OK! magazine) with a grain of salt. After all, they were just spotted looking totally in love on Aug. 20! Plus, HollywoodLife.com has heard EXCLUSIVELY that they already have plans for a fun Labor Day together, so hopefully he’ll pop back up on her social media this weekend!  HollywoodLifers, do you think Blake and Miranda will meet up?","According to recent reports, it seems that there may be some unresolved issues between Blake Shelton and his ex-wife, Miranda Lambert. Despite their divorce over two years ago, it appears that Miranda is now ready to have a sincere conversation with Blake and find closure. While rumors circulate about Blake facing difficulties in his current relationship with Gwen Stefani, an insider has shared with InTouch that Miranda is determined to confront her ex in order to gain clarity. The source explains, ""There are certain questions that need to be asked and answered, and it's time for them to address this unfinished business."" 

Although no specific plans have been made for this meeting, the magazine suggests that if it does happen, Miranda intends to approach the situation with a calm and collected mindset. However, the insider acknowledges that such an encounter may become emotionally charged, causing Miranda to potentially struggle with her composure. Despite this, it is important to note that Miranda has no intentions of rekindling any romantic relationship with Blake. In fact, quite the opposite is true: Miranda is currently in a happy relationship with Anderson East. The meeting with Blake is seen as a necessary step for her to fully commit to her current partner, as she believes that both she and Blake have grown significantly since their divorce. 

InTouch's insider further reveals, ""She feels that it is essential for them to meet in order to move forward and have healthy relationships in the future. Who knows, perhaps this meeting will allow them to part ways as friends. Either way, they will undoubtedly be in a better place after."" 

In regards to the alleged troubles between Blake and Gwen, it would be prudent to approach the OK! magazine report with skepticism. Recent photographs from August 20th show Blake and Gwen looking completely enamored with one another. Additionally, HollywoodLife.com has exclusively learned that the couple has plans for a delightful Labor Day outing together. It is safe to assume that Blake will reappear on Gwen's social media this weekend, indicating that all is well between the two. 

Do you believe that Blake and Miranda will indeed have this long-awaited meeting?"
gossipcop-4628620511,1,1,"Kris, 61, and 36-year-old Corey haven’t been seen together in public since Valentine’s Day - and even then they hardly looked loved up.  ‘Corey was traipsing around behind Kris holding her handbag. It was like she barely registered he was there,’ says an eyewitness who spotted them out in LA.  In a blow to Kris’ ego, it’s believed that Corey, Justin Bieber’s former road manager, initiated their break-up.  ‘She had been nagging him about a number of things for a while, including the fact that he wasn’t spending as much time with her as she’d like, and he just couldn’t take it anymore,' says Star’s source, who adds that Kris is devastated.  ‘She can’t stand to be alone. But I suspect she and Corey may have actually put on a united front in public for some time, since ratings have been way down for Keeping Up With The Kardashians. Kris is obsessed with maintaining the impression that everything is wonderful.","Kris, aged 61, and Corey, aged 36, have not been observed together in public since Valentine's Day - and even on that occasion, their affection towards one another appeared distant. According to an eyewitness who spotted them in LA, ""Corey was following Kris around while holding her handbag. It seemed as though she hardly acknowledged his presence."" 
Adding to Kris' disappointment, it is believed that Corey, previously associated with Justin Bieber as a road manager, initiated their separation. ""For a while now, she had been expressing her dissatisfaction with various issues, including his perceived lack of time spent together. Eventually, he reached a breaking point,"" disclosed a Star insider, noting Kris' devastation following the development.
Alone time appears to be an uncomfortable notion for Kris, as she strives to keep up appearances. Intriguingly, it is suspected that Kris and Corey had been projecting a united front in public for a considerable period, possibly due to declining ratings for their show, Keeping Up With The Kardashians. Kris is fervently determined to maintain the illusion of a harmonious existence."

Jennifer Lopez is not in a hurry to walk down the aisle with Alex Rodriguez, but she does want to spend the rest of her life with someone.  “I do believe in marriage,” the Shades of Blue actress, 48, told Harper’s Bazaar in a story published on Thursday, March 15. “And I would love to grow old with somebody in a committed relationship. But I’m not forcing anything right now.”  As far as her relationship with the 42-year-old former Yankees player, she said: “It’s good, it’s healthy; we communicate well. We understand each other’s lives in a way that most other people couldn’t.”  She added: “We both entered the public eye in our early twenties and overachieved right from the start. And that affects every dynamic in your life, from your family to your work to your relationships. We have a similar makeup.”  The pair celebrated their anniversary in February in Minneapolis, where the singer performed a concert ahead of the Super Bowl. During the show, she debuted her single “Us” written by Poo Bear and produced by Skrillex, and dedicated it to Rodriguez, who was in the audience. “We’ve been together for one year today. I don’t want to get all mushy or anything, but baby, this song’s for you. I love you,” she told the athlete while on stage.  When talking about how she chose the song, Lopez told the magazine that the lyrics fit right into where the couple were in their relationship. She said: “They played me about 20 different songs, and when I heard this one I was like, ‘Oh, this is relevant!’ Alex and I were just getting to know each other. And I was like, ‘Oh, my God, could this be? Could this be us?’”  Lopez was previously married to chef Ojani Noa for nearly a year in 1997, and dancer Cris Judd from 2001 to 2002. She later married singer Marc Anthony in 2004 and they called it quits in 2011. The pair share 10-year-old twins Max and Emme. The former Yankees shortstop shares daughters Ella, 9, and Natasha, 13, with ex-wife Cynthia Scurtis. They split in 2008 after six years of marriage.  A lot has changed in the “Dance Again” songstress’ life since her last relationship, and she said a lot of it has to do with really knowing herself. “When I was younger I spent a lot of time being half happy and half not happy,” she told the publication. “I know who I am and what I want. I also know my strengths and weaknesses. It took me a long time to get to a point where I could say something nice about myself. I’m glad I can do that now.”  Lopez remains optimistic as she continues with her career, raise her two children and make her relationship with Rodriguez work for the long run. “Baseball is just like life,” she said. “All you want to do is hit a home run.”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!","Jennifer Lopez, the acclaimed actress known for her role in ""Shades of Blue,"" recently shared her thoughts on marriage and her relationship with Alex Rodriguez.

gossipcop-5658990975,1,0,"Daniel Craig is returning as James Bond once again, even as he reportedly fights to save his marriage to Rachel Weisz at the same time. Craig has already announced his intent to return as 007 in the franchise’s 25th film, and according to the National Enquirer, he’s still struggling to salvage what’s left of his marriage.  The Enquirer’s source claimed at the beginning of 2017, “Rachel and Daniel haven’t been happy for a while, and nearly called it quits last year.” The report claims that the married couple was in two separate filming locations at the beginning of the year, but continued to stay apart even after wrapping their respective films. The Enquirer then claims that they finally reunited in July after not being seen together in ‘554 days’.  According to the sources, the minute the outlet attempted to lock down an exclusive on the couple’s rocky marriage, both Rachel Weisz and Daniel Craig were seen arriving at New York’s Public Theater the next day, prompting the source to add, “The whole thing just seemed like too much of a coincidence. I don’t buy it for a minute.”  When you consider Daniel Craig’s own words, especially in the context of allegedly turning down a $150 million payday to star in two more James Bond films, he had stated, “Being on your own would be sad, sick, and weird. I don’t trust myself. I need that balance.” If these reports are to be believed, then Daniel Craig previously turned down starring in more Bond films to spend time with his family, but now – all of a sudden – he’s back to working on James Bond?  Either the report was never accurate to begin with, or he’s giving up on his marriage to Rachel Weisz. One would hope that the two have worked out whatever was troubling them in the first place, but given their own relationship and marriage histories – and how they’ve both jumped ship on long-term relationships at the drop of a hat – one wouldn’t be faulted for assuming that they are on their way to getting a divorce.  What do you guys think? Are Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz having marriage troubles, and is Daniel’s decision to take on the role of 007 again an indication that he’s giving up on his marriage? Or just a chance to have more career stability and/or cash in on a major paycheck? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.  Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images for Sony Pictures","Daniel Craig is set to reprise his role as James Bond in the franchise's 25th film, while simultaneously addressing rumors surrounding his marriage to Rachel Weisz. Despite their reported struggles, Craig has made it clear that he intends to return as 007. According to a source cited by the National Enquirer, there have been ongoing issues in the couple's relationship, prompting speculation about the future of their union. The source claims that at the beginning of 2017, Weisz and Craig's relationship was strained, nearly leading to a breakup. They were then separated due to work commitments, with the Enquirer noting that they hadn't been seen together for a span of '554 days'. However, the source questions the timing of these reports, as Weisz and Craig were seen together shortly after the Enquirer started trying to uncover details about their marriage. This has led to skepticism regarding the validity of these claims. It is worth considering Craig's own words on the topic, particularly in light of his alleged decision to turn down a $150 million offer to star in two more James Bond movies. He has previously stated his reliance on the balance that comes with being in a committed relationship, expressing his aversion to the idea of being on his own. Thus, if these reports are accurate, Craig's sudden commitment to another Bond film raises questions about the state of his marriage. It is hopeful that they have resolved their issues, but given their respective histories with relationships and marriages, one could speculate that divorce may be imminent. Ultimately, the decision to take on the role of James Bond again could be interpreted as either an indication of Craig's disinterest in his marriage or as an opportunity for increased career stability and financial gain. We invite you to share your thoughts on this matter in the comments below."
gossipcop-4774142356,1,0,"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired. T","Katie Holmes, known for her role in the hit show ""Dawson's Creek"", has been rumored to be facing relationship struggles with her boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise, and their daughter Suri. According to a report from RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were supposedly planning a grand wedding worth $300,000, with Suri acting as the bridesmaid. This union was seen as a way to solidify their relationship, which had been kept mostly hidden for the past five years. However, it seems that the 39-year-old actress and single mother recently discovered that Foxx, a 50-year-old Oscar-winning actor, was not willing to give up his flirtatious tendencies, including maintaining a friendly relationship with his ex-girlfriend and mother of his 8-year-old daughter, Kristin Grannis. RadarOnline alleges that Foxx even brought Grannis as his date to Leonardo DiCaprio's birthday party in November. Realizing that her partner was not ready to commit, Holmes decided to call off the wedding and quietly break up with Foxx.

According to a source quoted by RadarOnline, Holmes became aware of Foxx's lack of respect towards her when he refused to sign a prenuptial agreement that included a no-cheating clause. This behavior caused Holmes to question the health of their relationship and the impact it would have on herself and her daughter Suri. Holmes felt the need to protect both of them. In addition to this ordeal, Holmes has also reportedly been dealing with her ex-husband Tom Cruise's attempts to reconnect with their daughter. Hollywood Life references a report from Star magazine, stating that Cruise regrets not being a present father for the past five years due to pressure from his Church of Scientology. The report suggests that Cruise is eager to become an active part of Suri's life once again.

The Star also claims that Holmes agreed to remain silent about Cruise and Scientology if he promised to stay away from their daughter and not engage in any attempts to influence her involvement with the controversial religious organization. Nevertheless, Holmes finds herself torn between her desire to protect Suri and her possible willingness to consider a reunion between Cruise and their daughter. According to an insider quoted by the Star, Holmes is slowly warming up to this possibility because she believes that Suri misses her father. She is cautiously considering this reconciliation while taking steps to ensure that Cruise does not bring his religious beliefs into their relationship.

Representatives for Holmes have denied both the breakup rumor about her and Foxx, as well as the report about a possible reunion between Cruise and Suri. Notably, Holmes' publicist, Leslie Sloane, has come forward to debunk the rumors, attaching her name to her statement. This marks the first on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx about the existence of their relationship, as they had gone to great lengths to keep it secret since reportedly starting dating in 2013. This secrecy was likely due to Holmes' divorce settlement from Cruise, which allegedly prohibited her from publicly dating for five years post-breakup. In September 2017, reports emerged suggesting that Holmes and Foxx had deliberately been photographed together on a Malibu beach, signaling the expiration of the five-year public dating ban.

Despite these denial statements, it is evident that the situation is complex and full of varying perspectives. The emotions and considerations involved in Holmes' relationships with Foxx and Cruise, as well as her role as a mother to Suri, are weighty and require careful handling."

Childhood pal Ninaki Priddy opened up about Prince Harry's fiancée, claiming her desire to be famous outweighed her commitment to her marriage to film producer Trevor Engelson.  Meghan married her ex back in 2011 on a Jamaican beach. They split two years later after she landed her role in Suits, which filmed in Toronto. Previously it was thought the pair grew apart after Meghan spent months filming in Canada and her beau was based in LA.  Ninaki says otherwise.  (Image: Getty Images North America)  (Image: REX/Shutterstock)  ""The way she handled it, Trevor definitely had the rug pulled out from under him. He was hurt,"" she said, explaining that while Trevor was heartbroken, Meghan was less affected,"" she told Mail Online.  Prior to their split, Ninaki - who was maid of honour at the wedding - said the pair doted on each other and Trevor would have done anything for the actress.  ""Then, after the wedding, it was like a light switched off. There’s Meghan before fame and Meghan after fame. After three seasons of Suits, she called me to say the marriage was over.  The pair first met aged two at Hollywood’s private Little Red School House before they went to the Immaculate Heart girls’ high school in Los Angeles at the age of 11.  Following a close friendship that she describes as 'sisterly', Ninaki says the pair eventually fell out over how Meghan and ex-husband - who the ex Suits star met when she was just 23 - split.  She explains she went to visit Trevor who was heartbroken over their split, while Meghan seemed less affected.

""I think it’s a very fanciful dream to believe that you just walk into a Prince Charming.  ""I know the Royal Family was something she found fascinating. She had one of Princess Diana’s books [Diana: Her True Story] on her bookshelf, and even when she was with Trevor she told me she wanted to go and stay in London for at least a month.""

Ninaki revealed, ""The way she handled it, Trevor definitely had the rug pulled out from under him. He was hurt.""

Prior to their split, Ninaki, who served as the maid of honour at their wedding, witnessed a strong and affectionate bond between the couple. She stated, ""Then, after the wedding, it was like a light switched off. There’s Meghan before fame and Meghan after fame. After three seasons of Suits, she called me to say the marriage was over.""

Meghan and Ninaki met at a young age, attending Hollywood's private Little Red School House together. Their friendship deepened when they both enrolled at the Immaculate Heart girls’ high school in Los Angeles at the age of 11. However, as time went on, they eventually fell out over the way Meghan and her ex-husband, whom she met at the age of 23, ended their relationship. Ninaki explains that she visited a heartbroken Trevor after their split, while Meghan appeared less affected.

Ninaki also shares that Meghan harbored aspirations of fame. ""She just loved to be the centre of attention,"" Ninaki said. ""We used to imagine her receiving an Oscar. She used to practise announcing herself."" Additionally, Meghan's interest in the Royal Family was evident to Ninaki, despite Meghan claiming to have known little about Prince Harry when they first met. ""I think it’s a very fanciful dream to believe that you just walk into a Prince Charming. I know the Royal Family was something she found fascinating,"" Ninaki explained.

In conclusion, Ninaki's insights provide a deeper understanding of the factors that led to Meghan Markle's first marriage ending and shed light on her aspirations for fame and interest in the Royal Family."

But for Victoria Adams, then known as Posh Spice, it turned out to be a key moment in her personal life too.  The video would soon catch the eye of Premier League soccer player David Beckham, who immediately picked out the brunette Spice Girl in her black PVC catsuit and matching gloves.  He declared: “That’s the girl for me and I'm going to get her! She's my idea of perfection. I knew that if she wanted me, we would be together forever.”  They later met at a Manchester United soccer players’ lounge, where it was love at first sight—although Victoria later admitted she was a little tipsy at the time.  The couple married in 1999 and had four children; sons Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz, and Harper. The pair have also forged a successful brand over their almost 20-year marriage, with Victoria starting a successful fashion label after attempting a less-than-stellar solo music career.  However, it hasn’t all been so rosy. The couple have endured a number of accusations of infidelity on David’s behalf, including from his former personal assistant Rebecca Loos in 2004.  The couple’s former nanny, Abbie Gibson, came forward in 2005 to stay their marriage was a sham, a claim hotly disputed by the Beckhams.  David retired from professional soccer in 2013, playing his final game in boots with the names of his wife and children stitched on to them.  He has consistently ranked among the highest earners in the sport. His net worth as of March 2017 is $450 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth—a number which Victoria matches through her own earnings.  As their marriage nears the two decade mark, we look back at the couple’s best moments. From spray-tanned party animals to chic and professional parents, these pictures show just how far they’ve come.","The Spice Girls, during the pinnacle of their fame in 1996, recognized the significance of the Say You'll Be There music video for their pop careers. Little did Victoria Adams, also known as Posh Spice, anticipate that this moment would have a profound impact on her personal life as well. It was within this visual masterpiece that Premier League soccer player David Beckham was captivated by the dark-haired Spice Girl, donning a black PVC catsuit and matching gloves. Beckham confidently proclaimed, ""She is the one for me, and I will make her mine. She epitomizes perfection. I had an unshakable belief that if she desired me, our union would be eternal."" Fate would soon grant them an encounter at a Manchester United soccer players' lounge, where love instantaneously blossomed. It is worth mentioning that Victoria confessed to being slightly inebriated at the time. In 1999, they solemnized their commitment in matrimony and went on to parent four children: Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz, and Harper. Over the course of nearly two decades, their enduring marital bond has also manifested as an accomplished brand. Following an underwhelming solo music career, Victoria opportunistically established a flourishing fashion label. Nevertheless, their journey has not been entirely smooth. David has been burdened with multiple allegations of infidelity, notably in 2004 when his former personal assistant, Rebecca Loos, came forward. Furthermore, their former nanny, Abbie Gibson, issued striking contentions in 2005, asserting that their marriage was fictitious. The Beckhams vehemently disputed these claims. David successfully concluded his professional soccer career in 2013, culminating with a heartfelt tribute as his final game featured boots adorned with the names of his beloved wife and children. Throughout his sporting tenure, he consistently ranked amongst the highest earners in the field. Celebrity Net Worth estimates his current net worth at $450 million as of March 2017, a figure that Victoria matches through her own individual earnings. As the couple approaches their twentieth anniversary, it is fitting to reminisce upon their most cherished moments. These pictures serve as poignant reminders of their transformation from tanned party enthusiasts to elegant and devoted guardians."

gossipcop-1551062653,1,0,"  George Clooney and his wife, Amal, attend the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. (Alberto Pizzoli/AFP via Getty Images)  Once the ultimate bachelor — and two-time People’s Sexiest Man Alive cover model — George Clooney entered entirely new territory this week.  The Oscar-winning actor and his human-rights-lawyer wife of two years, Amal, announced Tuesday that they are the proud new parents of twins, Ella and Alexander.  Clooney has donned many hats in his life — actor, director, producer and activist, but fatherhood had always seemed far away. Was it the early-onset-salt-and-pepper hair? The coterie of models who found themselves on his arm for fleeting moments over the years? The insistence by tabloids and fellow co-stars that it was time for him to settle down? Maybe. Or perhaps it was the simple fact that Clooney himself said again and again that he would not reproduce. In several interviews. Many, many times. For many, many years.  A first-time father at 56, Clooney was often asked throughout his career whether the single life was his ultimate future. But after proposing marriage to Amal in April 2014 and marrying her that September (as well as sharing wedding photos with People magazine in the United States and Hello magazine in Britain), it seemed as if anything was possible for the man who once said, “I don’t see myself ever having kids.”  But it was a long road to get there. “I don’t have that gene that people have to replicate,” he told People in 2006.  When Esquire asked him why he wasn’t married with kids, he replied, “I haven’t had aspirations in that way, ever.” And as for people who thought it was weird that a man in his 50s was single and childless? “What do you do? Should I go, ‘I got to get me some kids right now!’ and rush out and impregnate someone?”  Clooney seemed to express frustration when asked how he could ever relate to the fathers he occasionally portrays onscreen. His answer: “Well, I’m also not running for president, but I played that role in ‘Ides of March.’ I wasn’t an actual lawyer when I did ‘Michael Clayton,’ and I don’t fire people for a living like I did in ‘Up in the Air.’ ”  “I keep saying I’ll never get married again or have children but people just don’t want to believe me,” Clooney told Britain’s Daily Express just three months before popping the question to his now-wife.  Of course, celebrities are people, too, and it shouldn’t surprise anyone that a man might change his mind around the midcentury mark. And Clooney is certainly not alone in choosing to wait till later in life to welcome a child into the family: Comedian Steve Martin became a father at age 67 in 2012; Elton John was 63 when he had a baby via a surrogate in 2010; and Chris Noth was 53 when he welcomed his only child in 2008.  Perhaps it’s the fact that Clooney always seemed so delightfully and devilishly Clooney-ish that made his bachelordom seem like the only constant in our ever-changing popular culture. But we can rest easy knowing that despite some hesitation about having a family over the years, his sense of humor has remained steady throughout.  “Ella, Alexander and Amal are all healthy, happy and doing fine,” the statement announcing the birth of the twins read. “George is sedated and should recover in a few days.”","Renowned actor George Clooney and his respected human-rights-lawyer wife, Amal, graced the prestigious 2016 Cannes Film Festival. Previously embraced as the ultimate bachelor, adorned twice on the cover of People's Sexiest Man Alive, Clooney now embarks on a transformative journey. Delighting their supporters on Tuesday, the couple proudly shared their status as new parents, joyfully welcoming their twins, Ella and Alexander. Throughout his versatile career as an actor, director, producer, and activist, Clooney had seemingly distanced himself from the concept of fatherhood. Could it have been his graying hair, the fleeting presence of models on his arm, or the persistent suggestions of settling down from tabloids and co-stars? Conceivably. Alternatively, it could be attributed to Clooney's consistent declarations, repeated numerous times in countless interviews over many years, stating his disinterest in having children. Consequently, the 56-year-old first-time father contended with frequent questioning about his future as a bachelor. However, everything changed in April 2014 when he proposed to Amal, culminating in a September wedding. The couple even shared their wedding photos with People magazine in the United States and Hello magazine in Britain, thereby offering a glimpse into their newfound happiness. As Clooney himself once declared, ""I don’t see myself ever having kids."" Yet, the path to parenthood was undeniably extensive. ""I don’t have that gene that people have to replicate,"" Clooney shared candidly with People in 2006. When Esquire inquired about his unmarried and childless status, Clooney responded with a lack of aspiration. He mused, ""I haven’t had aspirations in that way, ever."" Regarding skepticism surrounding his lifestyle as a single man without children in his 50s, Clooney facetiously questioned whether he should abruptly change course and seek fatherhood in haste. Reflecting on his ability to connect with his onscreen portrayals of fathers, Clooney challenged the notion. He likened the situation to his roles as a president in ""Ides of March,"" a lawyer in ""Michael Clayton,"" or a professional ""firer"" in ""Up in the Air,"" stating that his acting prowess extended beyond personal experience. Clooney jokingly expressed his exasperation, affirming his stance on marriage and children just three months before proposing to Amal in an interview with Britain's Daily Express. Dismissing any surprise, Clooney joins a lineage of celebrities who chose to embrace fatherhood later in life. Entertainer Steve Martin welcomed his child at the age of 67 in 2012, Elton John became a father at 63 through surrogacy in 2010, and Chris Noth embraced fatherhood at 53 in 2008. While Clooney's persona has always been marked by delightful and devilish charm, his decision to become a parent showcases the evolving nature of our ever-changing popular culture. In the statement announcing the birth of his twins, Clooney's humor remained intact as he assured everyone of their health and happiness. He joked that he would require some time to recover while providing his assurance that he was sedated and would soon be back on his feet."

Mike Flynn and the Russian Ambassador. Sessions emphasized the department's proactive approach in dealing with this matter.

""We’re fully committed to pursuing this issue with utmost determination,"" Sessions stated regarding the leak of the transcript of Flynn's call. ""I am personally overseeing the investigations and our efforts are vigorous and thorough.""

Furthermore, Sessions highlighted the substantial increase in open investigations relating to leaks of classified information, stating, ""In the last two years before I took the position of Attorney General, there were only three open investigations per year. However, the number has now risen to 27.""

During the interview, host Maria Bartiromo discussed the seriousness of the situation, noting, ""There have already been alleged felonies committed. Last week, we had Congressman Devin Nunes, chairman of the Intel committee, who highlighted the issue of these felonies, which have not been duly addressed. Let me remind you of what he said on our show just last Sunday.""

Congressman Devin Nunes, in his appearance on the show, emphasized the gravity of the leak by stating, ""The most significant felony that has been overlooked since the beginning is the leak of highly classified information involving the phone call between the Russian ambassador and General Mike Flynn, which occurred just before the inauguration. This leak is a clear violation of the law and yet no action has been taken.""

Given the significance of the matter, Bartiromo asked Attorney General Sessions if his office is actively investigating this incident. Sessions promptly responded, acknowledging, ""Leaking classified documents is an illegal act, and rest assured, it is being thoroughly investigated. I must emphasize that prior to my tenure as Attorney General, there were only three investigations of such leaks per year. However, our current efforts have led to an unprecedented number of 27 investigations. We are resolutely committed to addressing this issue. I personally oversee some of these investigations, while others fall outside my recusal, and we are pursuing all of them with tenacity and focus."""

gossipcop-1289487505,1,0,"After years of overexposure thanks to his star-making turn in Twilight, Robert Pattinson values his privacy.  The actor appears on the September cover of GQ where he explained why he chooses to stay very quiet when it comes to his private life.  “I always think the risk reward is very much weighted in the wrong direction,” Pattinson, 31, said of opening up in interviews. “If I could stay silent, I would.”  Pattinson has been dating singer F.K.A. Twigs since 2014, and recently told Howard Stern they were “kind of” engaged. But when asked by GQ if he was getting married, the actor — who revealed he calls his girlfriend Twigs — responded with a noncommittal “eh.”  Daniel Jackson/GQ  Pattinson said that he went to therapy a few years ago – and his therapist commented that he was good at “talking without saying anything.” He said he uses that skill in all his interviews. The Good Time actor explained that he chooses to stay private so people don’t form ideas about his personality that may later change and label him as dishonest.  RELATED: Celeb Quotes of the Day: Jennifer Lawrence, Emma Stone & More  “I want to be misunderstood,” he told the magazine after declining to talk about anything personal. “People are always changing, and the more you put something down in print, people form opinions and they’re constantly creating who they think you are. If you do something that contradicts that, or if you do something which goes out of that box, then you can look like a liar or something like that.”  FROM PEN: Chrissy Metz on ‘This Is Us’, Crying on Set, and Her Body Positivity  The actor also revealed the great lengths he’d go to during the height of the Twilight whirlwind to a little privacy. He recalled how he would have different cars parked around Los Angeles with a full change of clothes. If he noticed he was being followed by paparazzi, he would pop into the garages, change, and leave in a different car.  He would also try to confuse photographers by having all of his friends order different rides out of restaurants when they were together and sending the cars to different places after trading outfits with one of his friends. Pattinson also recalled riding in trunks several times to hide from the photographers – and once drove around all night when one was tailing him to find out where his new house is.  “There are ways to disappear, like, fairly easily,” he said. “It just involves effort, and most people can’t be bothered to put the effort in.”  Good Time hits theaters August 11.","Renowned actor Robert Pattinson, known for his breakout role in Twilight, has long cherished his privacy. In a candid interview featured on the September cover of GQ, the actor elaborated on his preference for keeping his personal life closely guarded. ""The balance between risk and reward is often skewed in the wrong direction,"" shared the 31-year-old star when discussing the challenges of opening up in interviews. ""If given the choice, I would opt to maintain silence.""

Pattinson has been involved romantically with singer F.K.A. Twigs since 2014, and recently mentioned during an interview with Howard Stern that they were ""kind of"" engaged. However, when GQ inquired further about his marital status, the actor responded with a noncommittal ""eh."" 

Pattinson recounted a valuable insight gained from therapy a few years ago about his ability to ""talk without saying anything,"" which he admits he utilizes in all his interactions with the media. The Good Time actor explained that his desire for privacy stems from a desire to prevent the formation of fixed perceptions about his personality that may later prove to be inaccurately aligned, potentially leading to accusations of dishonesty.

""I aspire to be misunderstood,"" he articulated to the magazine, firmly refusing to delve into any personal matters. ""People evolve incessantly, and by committing thoughts to print, individuals form opinions that concretize an image of who they believe you are. Should you undertake actions that challenge or deviate from this preconceived notion, you risk being unjustly labeled or accused of being deceptive.""

Pattinson also shared anecdotes about the lengths he has gone to in order to secure a semblance of privacy amid the frenzy surrounding the Twilight phenomenon. Recalling his tactics during paparazzi pursuits, he disclosed his strategic placement of various cars across Los Angeles, complete with spare outfits for quick changes. Should he detect the presence of an unwelcome entourage, he would conveniently disappear into a nearby garage, change attire, and emerge driving a different vehicle. Moreover, he would confound photographers by arranging for different rides to whisk away him and his friends after meals, exchanging garments with a companion to further confuse onlookers. Additionally, on multiple occasions, the actor mentioned resorting to traversing in car trunks or driving aimlessly throughout the night to elude the relentless pursuit of photographers. 

""There are indeed methods of dissipating into anonymity,"" he asserted. ""Yet, they demand tireless exertion, an effort that most individuals are simply disinclined to exert.""

Be sure to catch Pattinson in his latest film, Good Time, when it hits theaters on August 11."

Caitlyn is no stranger to reality telly – she's starred in Keeping Up With The Kardashians since forevs, and even had her own show I Am Cait – and after proof that the Kardashian/Jenner family feud is still rife, this could be the perfect opportunity for her to set the record straight.

Celebrity Big Brother is reportedly willing to make a significant investment to secure the presence of Caitlyn Jenner in the upcoming series of the show. Jenner recently arrived in London to promote her new autobiography, ""The Secrets Of My Life"", leading to speculation about a potential secret meeting with the show's producers. Sources from the Daily Star have revealed that the bookers are highly interested in having Jenner on the show, recognizing her potential as a ratings-boosting asset due to the global fascination with her story. 

Jenner's experience in reality television is well-established, having been a prominent figure on ""Keeping Up With The Kardashians"" and having her own show, ""I Am Cait"". Given the ongoing tension within the Kardashian/Jenner family, this appearance could offer Jenner a chance to address any misconceptions and clarify her perspective. In a recent interview on Australia's Today Show, Jenner expressed her love for Kim Kardashian but admitted that they haven't communicated in a while, choosing to keep her distance in order to minimize drama. 

Kim Kardashian, in turn, defended her mother Kris during a recent interview with Ellen DeGeneres, suggesting that Jenner may not be entirely truthful in her memoir. Kardashian expressed sympathy for her mother, emphasizing that she believes the claims made by Jenner are unnecessary and unfair.

gossipcop-7658353025,1,0,"“A Star Is Born” is that thing we always yearn for but so rarely get to see: a transcendent Hollywood movie. It’s the fourth remake of a story that dates back to 1932, but this one has a look and vibe all its own — rapturous and swooning, but also delicate and intimate and luminous. It’s set in the present day, but in spirit it’s a sophisticated retro ’70s drama built around the uncanny flow of feeling that develops between the movie’s two stars: Bradley Cooper, who plays Jackson Maine, a hard-drinking, bad-ol’-boy redneck rock ‘n’ roller who is still hanging on as a popular attraction but has lost the lust for what he’s doing, and Lady Gaga, in her fetching and accomplished movie-star debut, as Ally, an ingenuous, fresh-faced singer-songwriter who becomes his lover and stage partner before rocketing on her own into the new pop stratosphere. She takes off as he slowly crashes — that’s the soapy tragic “Star Is Born” concept. But what the movie does is to take this fabled melodramatic romantic seesaw and turn it into something indelibly heartfelt and revealing. Cooper directed the movie himself, working from a script he co-wrote with Eric Roth and Will Fetters, and to say that he does a good job would be to understate his accomplishment. As a filmmaker, Bradley Cooper gets right onto the high wire, staging scenes that take their time and play out with a shaggy intimacy that’s shorn of the usual “beats.” The new “Star Is Born” is a total emotional knockout, but it’s also a movie that gets you to believe, at every step, in the complicated rapture of the story it’s telling. More Reviews Venice Film review: 'Isis, Tomorrow. The Lost Souls of Mosul' Telluride Film Review: 'They'll Love Me When I'm Dead' The 1976 version, starring Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson, had some terrific cornball love songs, but they didn’t belong anywhere near the stadium-rock stage, and neither did Streisand, which is part of why the movie came off as borderline ludicrous. It seemed stranded, with a kind of campy sincere ineptitude, between three worlds: Old Hollywood, New Hollywood, and Barbra Streisand rock-princess fantasy. But from the electrifying opening moments of the new version, in which Jackson, boozy and raw, with his sunburned squint and hard-bitten shit-kicker sexiness, takes the stage of a gigantic stadium and launches into a grinding slow rocker that sounds like “Victim of Love”-era Eagles as done by the Allman Brothers, the movie is thrillingly authentic. That’s no minor accomplishment. Hollywood almost never succeeds in nailing the rock world, but “A Star Is Born,” though a love story through and through, is the most lived-in rock ‘n’ roll movie since “Almost Famous.” And that absolute looks right, sounds right, feels right verisimilitude sets the stage for everything that follows. Jackson, who looks to be in his mid-40s, has been around long enough that he now occupies a grey zone between legend and nostalgia. He can still fill an arena full of screaming fans, and his old hits have become classic-rock chestnuts, but his sound and persona have long slipped out of the zeitgeist. His whole outlaw look — the beard and rancher’s hat, the Kristofferson-meets-Skynyrd soused macho twinkle — mark him as a charismatic relic, and the grand irony is this: What that look, and sound, are all about is an era when rock ‘n’ roll strutted its “authenticity,” but now that he’s out of date, Jackson’s authenticity looks more than ever like a showbiz conceit, frozen in amber. It’s a part he’s playing, an image he’s working — and secretly struggling — to keep alive. He’s got a signature ballad that goes “Maybe it’s time to let the old ways die,” and when he wrote it (long ago), he probably didn’t know that he was talking about himself. In the first of many telling jump cuts, the film leaps from his on-stage glory to Jackson slinking into the back of his car, weary and alone, grabbing the bottle of gin he’s got stashed there. He takes a guzzle, and Coop","""A Star Is Born"" is an exceptional Hollywood film that captures the transcendence we all yearn for but rarely witness. This fourth adaptation of an age-old tale, dating back to 1932, possesses a distinct elegance and atmosphere of its own. Its ethereal and intimate essence, coupled with its luminosity, makes it a truly remarkable experience. Although the story is set in the present, its spirit reflects a sophisticated retro '70s drama, centered around the profound connection formed between the film's two stars. Bradley Cooper, portraying the character of Jackson Maine, a weathered and weary rock 'n' roller clinging onto his fading popularity, and Lady Gaga, in her captivating and accomplished movie debut as Ally, an untainted and talented singer-songwriter, embark on a journey that propels Ally into the stratosphere of pop music while Jackson spirals downward. This classic tragic concept is transformed into an indescribably heartfelt and revealing masterpiece by Bradley Cooper, who takes the reins as director from a script he co-wrote alongside Eric Roth and Will Fetters. To say that Cooper does justice to the film would be an understatement. As a filmmaker, he fearlessly walks the tightrope, orchestrating deliberately paced scenes that exude an authentic and unscripted intimacy. ""A Star Is Born"" is a truly emotionally captivating experience, and it effortlessly instills a sense of belief in the intricate and spellbinding story it presents. In contrast, the 1976 version starring Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson contained a collection of sensational melodramatic love songs. Unfortunately, these pieces did not blend well within the stadium-rock era, and even Streisand's presence felt out of place, resulting in a film that teetered on the verge of ludicrousness. It seemed stranded, unsure of its identity amidst the realms of Old Hollywood, New Hollywood, and Barbra Streisand's rock-star fantasy. However, in the electrifying opening moments of the updated ""A Star Is Born,"" where a boozy and rugged Jackson takes the stage with a sunburned squint and an irresistible aura of machismo, the film effortlessly captivates. With a grinding slow-rocker reminiscent of the Eagles' ""Victim of Love"" era as performed by the Allman Brothers, the authenticity of the movie becomes instantly palpable. This achievement is no small feat. Hollywood rarely manages to capture the essence of the rock world, but ""A Star Is Born"" not only serves as an immersive love story, but it also stands as the most authentic rock 'n' roll film since ""Almost Famous."" The film's genuine verisimilitude, which resonates visually, aurally, and emotionally, forms a solid foundation upon which everything unfolds. Jackson, appearing to be in his mid-40s, resides in a gray area somewhere between legend and nostalgia. While he can still fill arenas with adoring fans, his older hits have transitioned into beloved classics, and both his sound and persona have gradually slipped away from the zeitgeist. His entire outlaw persona, complete with a rugged beard and a rancher's hat, coupled with a combination of Kris Kristofferson and Lynyrd Skynyrd's rugged allure, positions him as a charming relic. Paradoxically, this image reflects an era when rock 'n' roll reveled in its authenticity. However, now that he is outdated, Jackson's authenticity serves as a showbiz facade, forever frozen in time. It's a role he continues to play, a persona he struggles to maintain secretly. Jackson possesses a signature ballad with the lyrics, ""Maybe it's time to let the old ways die,"" a song he likely wrote without knowing he was revealing his own fate. In a series of poignant jump cuts, the film transitions from Jackson's on-stage glory to a weary and desolate figure slinking into the backseat of his car, immediately reaching for the bottle of gin he has stashed for this very purpose. Through Cooper's masterful acting, the audience can truly feel the profound yearning for that drink, which Jackson believes in more than the captivating performance he just concluded. Portraying a drunken character is a challenging task, and Cooper expertly navigates this territory. Rather than resorting to exaggerated slurred speech, he skillfully portrays a functional drunk, seamlessly blending into his element. His grin and reflexes are fueled by liquor, while his voice emanates a deep, deliberate, and distinct Southern accent infused with the essence of alcohol. Desiring another drink, Jackson instructs his driver to take him to the nearest bar, which happens to be a roadside dive hosting drag-queen karaoke night. Although this setting isn't his usual scene, Jackson remains unfazed. Regardless of his location, he remains a celebrity, finding solace in the radiant contentment that accompanies his fame. It is during this fateful evening that Ally takes the stage, the sole non-drag performer among a sea of queens. The film executes a clever twist, juxtaposing Ally's powerful emotional outburst during her breakup over the phone with her transformation into an enigmatic figure adorned with heavy white makeup, exaggerated eyebrows, and a punk-inspired hairdo. Her rendition of ""La Vie en Rose,"" complete with theatrical flourishes, exudes a theatrical kitsch that is so quintessentially Gaga. Following the show, Jackson tenderly removes an eyebrow from Ally and extends an invitation for a drink. Emerging from the dressing room"

She credits Joe for that and realizes how much better off she is.”  Swift, for one of the first times in the public eye, has not talked about Alwyn in any interviews. She has barely been photographed out with him, though this week they were shot holding hands in Turks and Caicos. “They seemed genuinely happy,” a witness there told Us of their interactions out and about there. “They were always smiling and close to each other, but kept to themselves.”  Swift isn't about to say anything about Alwyn though, another source cautioned the outlet.

Years later, Brad regrets leaving the Friends star for his now-ex Angelina Jolie, a source told In Touch exclusively.  Following his 2016 separation from Angie, Brad sobered up and sought therapy. And now, he’s “in touch with emotions and his true self like never before,” the source says.  Brad Pitt finally opens up about his bitter divorce with Angelina Jolie  And it seems like this self-awareness comes with some great realisations. “He has come to realise that leaving Jen for Angelina was one of the biggest mistakes of his life,” the source adds. “And while he’s not in love with Jen, he realises how much he does love her. Brad keeps telling friends that he’s seeing everything more clearly.”  However, these realisations are obviously far too late. Jennifer has been married to Wanderlust co-star Justin Theroux for two years now.  And while Brad would “never dream of” ruining his ex’s new marriage, he “would take a second chance at love with Jen in a heartbeat.”  If they can’t be romantic partners, though, the War Machine star wants Jen to be his partner in other pursuits, In Touch further reported.  Brad Pitt “much happier” following split from Angelina Jolie  “They worked well together” when they formed the production company Plan B in 2001, an insider close to Brad told In Touch. “He wants Jen involved again as he produces and develops more and more high-quality film and cable TV products.”  That kind of professional partnership could pay off for Jen, too, since the insider states she wants in on “prestige projects” under his production banner. “She’d be beyond thrilled to win an Academy Award for Best Actress — something that’s evaded both her and Angelina.”  “He still considers Jen the love of his life,” the source concluded.  Have something to add to the story? Share it in the comments below.  Read full story","After seeking therapy and reflecting on his past, actor Brad Pitt has come to a profound realization about his former relationship with actress Jennifer Aniston. Sources close to the actor have revealed that Pitt deeply regrets leaving Aniston for his now-ex Angelina Jolie.

Following his separation from Jolie in 2016, Pitt made the decision to embrace sobriety and engage in therapy, which has provided him with a newfound emotional clarity. This newfound self-awareness has led him to acknowledge that leaving Aniston for Jolie was one of the biggest mistakes of his life. While Pitt may not be in love with Aniston currently, he has realized the depth of his love for her and expresses that he now sees things more clearly.

However, these realizations come too late, as Aniston has been happily married to her Wanderlust co-star Justin Theroux for the past two years. Pitt has no intention of interfering with her current relationship. Nevertheless, he does admit that he would seize the opportunity for a second chance at love with Aniston in a heartbeat, but strictly if the circumstances allowed it.

In addition to a romantic connection, Pitt aspires to have a professional partnership with Aniston. They previously collaborated successfully when they formed the production company Plan B in 2001. Pitt hopes to involve Aniston once again as he continues to produce and develop high-quality film and cable TV projects. This collaboration could be advantageous for both parties, as Aniston also desires to partake in prestigious projects under Pitt's production banner, aiming to achieve an Academy Award for Best Actress, an accolade that has eluded both her and Jolie.

It is evident that Brad Pitt still considers Jennifer Aniston the love of his life, concludes the source. Although the opportunity for a romantic reunion may be out of reach, it is apparent that Pitt values Aniston as a significant presence in both his personal and professional life.

gossipcop-4241884018,1,0,"In the past, Kanye’s capriciousness has been repeatedly forgiven and, at times, belatedly rewarded with accolades. It is hard to imagine a My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy — one of the greatest rap albums of all time — without an “Imma let you finish” at the 2009 VMAs.  His new album, ye, doesn’t merit any similar mercy.  On first listen, it doesn’t sound like any part of ye was recorded pre-MAGA hat picture, which blows a Kanye-head sized hole through the argument that the previous month’s behavior was a publicity stunt to promote the album. If anything, the album seems like an meek afterthought to the Twitter tirade and dive into right-wing politics. Most of it deals with the repercussions of the storm which came before it, and for the first time in his career, the artist’s personality is overwhelming the art.  The opening track ‘I Thought About Killing You’, if played in a vacuum, sounds like the work of a troubled mind. If a poem like this came from a loved one, it would surely merit discussion about a trip to the therapist. Kanye goes on to deliver cringe-worthy rhymes on issues ranging from Russell Simmons rape allegations to his petrification on realizing that his daughter might one day look like his wife. He teases a few tidbits of The Old Kanye, chopping up beats from Slick Rick and The Edwin Hawkins Singers samples on ‘No Mistakes’, to keep his fans just interested enough. It’s telling that the one standout track, ‘Ghost Town’ is the track on which Kanye lurks in the background, devoting more time on production than on spoken word, and letting John Legend and Kid Cudi take over.  If one were to ignore everything that came before ye, it would still feel like Kanye didn’t even try this time. The usual meticulousness and perfectionism has apparently been supplanted by a Kanye shrug. The music is haphazard and hollow, mirroring the guy making it. Maybe he’s become blasé and doesn’t want to spend time on music anymore. He did say he wanted to run for President in 2020 (or 2024?) anyway.","In previous instances, Kanye's erratic behavior was often forgiven and occasionally lauded. It is difficult to envision the masterpiece that is My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, one of rap's finest albums, without recalling the infamous ""Imma let you finish"" moment at the 2009 VMAs. However, his latest release, ye, does not warrant such clemency. Upon initial listening, it becomes apparent that no part of ye was recorded prior to the controversial MAGA hat snapshot, which dismantles the assertion that his prior month's actions were merely a calculated publicity stunt to promote the album. If anything, the album seems like a feeble afterthought to his Twitter rampage and foray into right-wing politics. The majority of the project revolves around the aftermath of the tumultuous events that preceded it, and, for the first time in his career, the artist's personality overwhelms the art. The opening track, 'I Thought About Killing You', when assessed in isolation, bears the markings of a troubled mind. Were this a poem authored by a loved one, it would undeniably prompt discussions about seeking therapeutic assistance. Kanye proceeds to deliver cringe-worthy lyrics, addressing topics ranging from Russell Simmons' rape allegations to his anxieties about his daughter resembling his wife in the future. He offers snippets of the ""Old Kanye"" on 'No Mistakes', slicing up beats from Slick Rick and incorporating samples from The Edwin Hawkins Singers, and manages to hold the attention of his fans, albeit just barely. It is noteworthy that the standout track, 'Ghost Town', is the one in which Kanye deliberately maintains a background presence, dedicating more time to production and allowing John Legend and Kid Cudi to take the lead. Even if one were to disregard everything leading up to ye, it would still feel as though Kanye exerted minimal effort this time. His usual meticulousness and pursuit of perfection have seemingly been replaced with an indifferent shrug. The music lacks cohesion and depth, mirroring the individual responsible for its creation.

Lisa Kudrow has offered up even more proof that the cast of “Friends” took the name of the beloved sitcom to heart.  On Monday, the actress told People that her co-stars altered a pre-show ritual when she was pregnant during Seasons 4 and 5 to include her unborn child — her now 20-year-old son, Julian Murray Stern.  “The six of us would do a huddle backstage and just say, ‘All right, have a good show, love you love you love you love you,’” Kudrow, 55, told the outlet. “And when I was pregnant, then they would say, ‘Have a great show, love you love you — love you, little Julian!’ ’Cause we knew it was a boy and that was his name.”  She added: “So sweet, they included my little fetus in the huddle.”  The stars of “Friends” embraced one another’s children at other times, too.

gossipcop-1716370499,1,1,"Dakota Johnson; most of us know her as the actress from Fifty Shades of Grey. While we may have seen Johnson in some pretty intimate positions on-screen, there’s definitely a lot we don’t know about the Fifty Shades star. Like, for instance, the superfluity of familiar names in her family tree. Seeing that her popular movie, Fifty Shades Darker came out on the day of love—Valentine's Day—it's only fitting to dedicate a piece to the actress who brought us the sexy and quaint, Anastasia Steele. Johnson, after all, has become somewhat something of a Valentine’s Day staple, herself. Here are 15 facts about Dakota Johnson or, as some might call her, ""that girl from Fifty Shades of Grey."" We guarantee that she will no longer by ""that girl"" by the end of the list! 15 Her Family Tree Is Full Of Famous Faces You know how we said there are a few familiar names in her family tree? Well, we weren’t lying. Her parents are fellow actors, Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson. Unfortunately, her parents divorced in 1994 so Dakota had to split her time between the two. ""It was the only way that I could be with them,"" she said in an interview for Cosmopolitan. ""And since they were divorced, I would spend two weeks with one and two weeks with the other, traveling with a tutor."" But wait, it gets better. Her maternal grandmother (can you guess..) is Hitchcock actress Tippi Hedren. Yes, that’s right, so clearly creative talent lies in that family. We’ve never heard of a family tree with so many famous names! Thanksgiving is probably a whirlwind. Now, Dakota Johnson is another famous name in that tree. 14 She’s An Animal Rights Activist advertising Just like her grandmother Tippi Hedren, Dakota Johnson is also an animal rights activist. Like grandmother, like granddaughter shall we say? As animal lovers ourselves, we’re pleased to hear that she’s following in her grandmother’s footsteps—both in acting and in animal rights. In 2014, Johnson saved 12 horses from being slaughtered by paying for them. What a sweet thing to do! We bet her grandmother was really proud. It’s always so great to hear about celebrities doing positive things - so naturally, we’re happy to hear of Dakota’s compassionate side. We admit we have a soft spot for animal lovers, but who doesn't? We always love hearing about people doing good deeds for animals and it’s always nice to hear celebrities using their celebrity title for the better. 13 She Grew Up Shooting Guns And Riding Horses In Colorado She may play the innocent and naive Anastasia Steele in the Fifty Shades movies, but growing up Johnson was anything but naive. She grew up in Colorado at her dad’s house, where she learned to build a fire, ride a horse, ride motorbikes, and even shoot a gun. And this was all before she was just 10 years old! Sounds like a badass kid to us! But when she wasn’t at her father’s house, she was at her mom’s house in L.A. which she also loved. It's hard to imagine a 10 year old these days shooting guns, riding motorbikes, or building fires without being grounded. But it sounds like she had a pretty inspiring and freeing childhood which makes us fall for the actress all the more. 12 She Never Dates advertising By the header, we mean she never has casual relationships. She only has long-term relationships. Good for her, is all we can say! You hear of so many celebrities who are constantly dating other celebrities. You can barely keep up with who they’re dating these days. It seems to be one guy or girl after another. So it’s great to hear of Dakota’s conservative views on relationships. Apparently she’s only ever been in long-term, serious relationships; she doesn’t just date. That probably explains why she’s been in a relationship with model Matthew Hitt since 2014. Yes, it’s been a kind of an on-and-off relationship but they’ve been in it for the long haul so far. So, to sum up, we like her whole dating attitude. The commitment is great and saves you a lot of time. 11 She HATED School It seems l","Dakota Johnson, widely recognized for her role in Fifty Shades of Grey, remains an enigma despite her on-screen intimacy. Beyond her portrayal of the alluring Anastasia Steele, there is much about the actress that remains unknown. Notably, her family tree boasts an abundance of familiar names, with her parents being fellow actors, Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson. The familial bond, however, was severed in 1994, leading to Dakota's journey of splitting time and traveling with a tutor. Furthermore, her maternal grandmother happens to be none other than the renowned Hitchcock actress, Tippi Hedren, displaying a clear lineage of creative excellence.

In addition to her acting career, Dakota Johnson actively embraces the cause of animal rights, reflecting the altruistic spirit of her grandmother, Tippi Hedren. In a remarkable instance of compassion, Johnson purchased and saved twelve horses from an imminent slaughter in 2014. This noble act undoubtedly aligned with her grandmother's principles, and serves as a reminder of the positive impact celebrities can make when they leverage their influence.

While Dakota Johnson may embody the seemingly innocent Anastasia Steele in the Fifty Shades films, her upbringing paints a completely contrasting picture. Growing up in Colorado under her father's roof, she acquired a range of unconventional skills and experiences. From learning to build a fire and ride horses, to mastering the art of shooting guns and maneuvering motorbikes, Johnson's formative years were characterized by a remarkable sense of adventure and daring. Despite such a bold upbringing, she also relished her time with her mother in Los Angeles, creating a truly multifaceted childhood that contributes to her captivating persona.

In matters of the heart, Dakota Johnson adheres to a distinct approach. Known for her long-term commitment in relationships, Johnson diverges from the typical dating practices prevalent amongst her celebrity peers. Her conservative view on relationships is exemplified by her enduring affiliation with model Matthew Hitt, which has withstood the test of time since 2014. Her steadfast commitment demonstrates the value she places on emotional connection, a perspective worth noting in today's fast-paced dating culture.

Remarkably, Johnson openly admits to harboring a loathing for school, a sentiment many of us can relate to. She describes feeling like an ""alien"" and struggling to comprehend the purpose of formal education, ultimately feeling suffocated by the system. Johnson gravitated towards socializing with friends over attending classes, finding solace in companionship rather than conformity. Her candidness resonates with those who have experienced similar sentiments, highlighting the challenges many face within the confines of an educational institution.

It is essential to remember that the celebrities we idolize often grapple with self-doubt and anxiety, despite exuding confidence on the red carpet. Dakota Johnson exemplifies this truth, as auditions trigger panic attacks within her. The pressure and vulnerability she experiences speak to the universal nature of self-doubt, reminding us that even those we perceive as supremely self-assured battle their own internal demons.

In conclusion, Dakota Johnson's life encompasses a tapestry of compelling experiences and values that shape her identity beyond her fame as the ""girl from Fifty Shades of Grey."" Her lineage of renowned talents, commitment to animal rights, unique upbringing, conservative approach to relationships, disdain for formal education, and vulnerability in the face of auditions all contribute to her multifaceted personality. By delving deeper into her story, we unravel the layers of a truly captivating individual."

gossipcop-9811720113,1,0,"I, at least, struggle to understand her career. Her performance as a junkie in “The Town” features the “Bride Wars” of Boston accents. Her performance in “The Age of Adaline” — as a woman “cursed” to stay 30 forever — was like watching a mermaid ride a bike. She tries. But her acting hasn’t yet caught up to her algorithm-generated beauty. Alas, there may be no algorithmic solution for that.  So I was less than psyched at the prospect of seeing her shiver on a buoy, stitch her own wounds, talk to animals or play a Nancy. And, as refreshing as it is watching her stand on a surfboard, it’s refreshment that provides some perspective. While some actors make sense on movie screens, there are others who might make better sense on a can of something — beer, beans, air. I can hear you, Hudson skeptics. And all I can say is that the heart wants what the heart wants. I’d actually buy whatever Ms. Hudson was on the can of.  There might be no appreciable industrial difference between what a Kate Hudson can do versus your Blake Livelys. I don’t think they’re interchangeable, but sometimes the movies beg to differ, and the market corrects itself. Don’t fall in love with Mark Harmon, because here comes Kevin Costner. And sell your Brad Rowe stock, because he’s just going to be replaced by Brad Pitt. (In the late 1990s, that pretty much happened.) But there are continuums, too. Channing Tatum, for instance, is a more elastic, hip-hop-era Brendan Fraser upgrade.  Lots of parts that have gone to Ms. Lively feel as if Ms. Hudson could have played them. But something happened, and suddenly it was someone else’s turn to be “it.” (It’s always someone else’s turn.) And part of what annoys me about the lack of Kate Hudson in my life and the surfeit of Ms. Lively is the same thing that makes me angry when a perfectly good piece of software gets a superfluous update, or a zealous waiter takes my plate at a restaurant: I wasn’t done with that.","I find it challenging to comprehend her career trajectory. Her portrayal of a drug addict in the film ""The Town"" exhibits a perplexing amalgamation of Boston accents akin to the mismatched dynamic in ""Bride Wars."" Similarly, her performance in ""The Age of Adaline,"" where she plays a perpetually young woman cursed with eternal youth, is reminiscent of observing a mermaid effortlessly maneuvering a bicycle. Though she endeavors to excel, her acting prowess has yet to catch up to her algorithmically generated beauty. Unfortunately, it seems that there may not be an algorithmic remedy for this disparity. Consequently, I approached the notion of witnessing her tremble on a buoy, tending to her own injuries, conversing with animals, or assuming the persona of a Nancy with less enthusiasm. Nonetheless, witnessing her poised presence on a surfboard offers a refreshing perspective. While certain actors thrive in the context of motion pictures, there are others whose essence may be more aligned with a product like beer, beans, or even air. I am aware of the skeptics who question Kate Hudson's abilities, yet I believe that personal preferences transcend such concerns. In fact, I would willingly purchase any product endorsed by Ms. Hudson. The industrial disparity between the capabilities of actresses like Kate Hudson and Blake Lively may not be significant. Although I do not view them as interchangeable, there are instances when the film industry contradicts this notion and corrects itself through market forces. One mustn't become too infatuated with Mark Harmon, as Kevin Costner is bound to emerge as the next phenomenon. Similarly, it is wise to divest from Brad Rowe stocks as Brad Pitt emerges as the inevitable replacement. (This shift was quite evident during the late 1990s.) Nonetheless, there are gradients within this continuum. Channing Tatum, for example, represents a versatile, hip-hop-infused upgrade of Brendan Fraser's persona from a bygone era. Many roles typically assigned to Ms. Lively could have been effortlessly portrayed by Ms. Hudson. Yet, circumstances intervened, prompting another actress to take center stage. (It is always someone else's turn.) What frustrates me about the dearth of Kate Hudson's presence and the surfeit of Ms. Lively is akin to the annoyance felt when an otherwise functional software undergoes an unnecessary update, or when an overzealous waiter abruptly removes an unfinished plate at a restaurant: I had not concluded my experience."

When model Tati Neves, 26, was asked if she kissed the Baby singer , she coyly answered: ""What do you think, if I was sleeping in the bedroom, just me and him?""  That really clears it up then.  Before the interview on Brazilian TV the model allegedly told friends she saw Bieber smoke weed and spent the night with him.  On Globo TV's Fantastico she was asked if she saw a bevy of girls arrive at 3am the same night, believed to bussed in from a nearby club, she replied: ""No. So, I'd already gone into the bedroom with him.""  She also claimed she had taken the video of Bieber asleep, with his beloved baseball cap nearby, the following morning after waking up first.  (Image: Youtube)  She said: ""I was sleeping, and woke up, he was sleeping and I was speaking with a girlfriend.""  Tati, who appears naked on some adult Brazilian websites, is thought to have met Bieber in the Centaurus club in Rio which is notorious for being a brothel.  But Marcus Mion, the owner of the Zax Club in the Barra da Tijuca neighborhood, disputed the model's account.  He said Ms Neves wasn't among the 30 girls the singer chose to go back with him to his rented villa.  (Image: Youtube)  He said: ""I know all the girls who went. I personally went round asking inviting them on behalf of Justin, and I put each one in the van that took them there.""  Two girls were pictured leaving the club with Bieber, although his aides insist he thought it was a private members’ club.  Bieber has now left Brazil and is in Argentina on the South America leg of his world tour.  He has been asked to leave the Hotel Faena in Buenoa Aires because his fans were destroying property and barricade walls put up for his arrival.  On Sunday he said Argentina was “crazy” and told the fans there he loved them after Saturday’s gig.  3am has contacted Bieber for a comment.","The individual who captured footage of Justin Bieber asleep has recently shared her account of the night she spent with the renowned Canadian artist. Model Tati Neves, 26, was discreetly asked if she engaged in a kiss with the Baby singer, to which she responded, ""Consider the circumstances: it was just the two of us in the bedroom."" This response sheds light on the situation. Prior to her interview on Brazilian TV, Neves reportedly confided in friends, mentioning Bieber's marijuana use and their time spent together. During her appearance on Globo TV's Fantastico, she was questioned about the arrival of numerous girls at 3am, suspected to have been transported from a nearby club. Neves confidently responded, ""No. By that point, I had already gone to the bedroom with him."" Neves also revealed that she filmed Bieber while he was asleep, his cherished baseball cap nearby, the next morning after awakening first. She explained, ""I woke up and he was still sleeping, so I starting chatting with a girlfriend."" Some sources suggest that Neves met Bieber at the Centaurus club in Rio, a notorious establishment known for its connection to the sex trade. However, Marcus Mion, the owner of the Zax Club in the Barra da Tijuca neighborhood, contradicts Neves' claims. Mion confirms that Neves was not among the 30 girls personally selected by Bieber to accompany him back to his rented villa. Mion stated, ""I personally invited and arranged transportation for each girl on behalf of Justin."" Although two girls were seen leaving the club with Bieber, his team insists that he believed it to be a private members' club. Bieber has since departed from Brazil and is currently in Argentina as part of his South America tour. At the Hotel Faena in Buenos Aires, Bieber was asked to leave due to his fans causing damage and barricading walls set up for his arrival. Following Saturday's performance, Bieber expressed his love for his Argentinean fans, describing them as ""crazy."" 3am has reached out to Bieber for a comment."

gossipcop-6722352082,1,0,"Carlotta is a fictional character from Gaston Leroux's 1909 novel The Phantom of the Opera.  In the novel, she is a minor character hailing from Spain. The first time that she is mentioned in the novel is during the chapter ""The New Marguerite"", where it is revealed that she could not perform at the ceremony for the former managers. Later in the novel, she is threatened by Erik that if she performs at the Opera House ""a great misfortune will strike"". She shrugs the warning off and performs anyway. When she does, however, croaking noises come out of her mouth and the chandelier comes crashing down. Ashamed, she hides from the public view for a few weeks, before making a return to the opera house.  Carlotta is portrayed by Virginia Pearson in the original 1925 silent film with Lon Chaney. In 1929, new sound scenes were filmed and Mary Fabian was recast as Carlotta, due to the fact that she could sing. Virginia Pearson still appeared in new scenes, now playing Carlotta's mother. These changes are also the same in the 1929 silent, foreign cut of the film (which is most commonly viewed).  In the 1943 film version, she is Mme. Biancarolli who has been drugged by the Phantom and murdered along with her maid when she tries to force him to take off his prop mask.  In Andrew Lloyd Webber's production, Carlotta (last name Giudicelli) is from Italy and is one of the major singing parts. The opera company's prima donna, she despises Christine Daaé and sees the younger woman as a threat to her job and Phantom´s courtesan, when Christine achieves prominence due to the Phantom's dirty tricks. Carlotta and tenor Ubaldo Piangi are lovers; she often turns to him for consolation when things go wrong, and she breaks down crying when his murdered body is discovered onstage. The film reveals that she likes poodles.  In the Lloyd Webber-Joel Schumacher 2004 film version, she was played by Minnie Driver.[1] Due to Driver's lack of experience in opera, her singing voice was dubbed by opera singer Margaret Preece, although she lent her actual voice to the song ""Learn to Be Lonely"" during the end credits.  In Nicholas Meyer's novel The Canary Trainer, the characters of Carlotta and La Sorelli are combined into one, despite being mentioned as separate characters in the original novel. In Kim Newman's short story ""Angels of Music"" from the Tales of the Shadowmen anthology series, Carlotta is implied to be the ancestor of Bianca Castafiore from The Adventures of Tintin comic series.","Carlotta, a character brought to life by Gaston Leroux in his renowned 1909 novel The Phantom of the Opera, holds a significant yet brief presence on the pages. Hailing from Spain, she is introduced in the chapter titled ""The New Marguerite"", where it is disclosed that she had been unable to partake in the ceremony for the former managers. As the narrative unfolds, she finds herself confronted by Erik, who warns her of dire consequences should she dare perform at the Opera House. Undeterred, she dismisses the threat, only to face a humiliating ordeal during her performance. To her dismay, raucous sounds escape her vocal cords while the chandelier crashes down upon the stage. Consumed by shame, she withdraws from the public eye for several weeks before finally reclaiming her place at the opera house.

In the original 1925 silent film adaptation of Leroux's masterpiece, Carlotta is portrayed by Virginia Pearson, sharing the screen with the legendary Lon Chaney. Subsequently, in 1929, sound scenes were incorporated, leading to the recasting of Mary Fabian as Carlotta due to her singing abilities. However, Virginia Pearson remained, now assuming the role of Carlotta's mother. These alterations persisted in the 1929 silent, foreign version of the film, which is the most widely viewed rendition.

Fast forward to the 1943 film adaptation, where Carlotta takes on a new identity as Mme. Biancarolli. Entrapped and drugged by the Phantom, Mme. Biancarolli meets a harrowing end, along with her loyal maid, when she imprudently attempts to unveil the Phantom's concealed countenance.

In Andrew Lloyd Webber's illustrious stage production, Carlotta, now bearing the surname Giudicelli, hails from Italy and commands a prominent singing role. As the prima donna of the opera company, she harbors a vehement animosity towards Christine Daaé, perceiving her as a formidable rivalry jeopardizing her position. Moreover, Carlotta becomes entangled in the Phantom's deceptive machinations, eventually succumbing to her tears upon the heart-wrenching discovery of her lover, tenor Ubaldo Piangi, murdered on stage. An intriguing revelation from the film adaptation exposes her affinity for poodles.

In the 2004 film version helmed by Lloyd Webber and Joel Schumacher, the role of Carlotta is brought to life by Minnie Driver. Due to Driver's limited experience in opera, her singing voice is skillfully dubbed by opera singer Margaret Preece, while Driver herself lends her authentic voice to the captivating song ""Learn to Be Lonely"" featured in the end credits.

Lastly, Nicholas Meyer's novel The Canary Trainer presents a unique amalgamation of characters, merging Carlotta and La Sorelli into one, despite their individual mentions in the original novel. Even more intriguingly, Kim Newman's short story ""Angels of Music"" from the Tales of the Shadowmen anthology series hints at Carlotta being the ancestral connection to Bianca Castafiore of The Adventures of Tintin comic series."
gossipcop-178000221,1,0,"Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge wasn’t always a royal, but even before her marriage to Prince William, Kate Middleton had an impressive net worth.  Middleton had a comfortable upbringing before she became the first commoner to join the royal family after she married William in 2011. But Middleton’s net worth ballooned once she became a duchess.  Here’s everything we know about Middleton’s net worth:  What is Kate Middleton’s net worth?  The 36 year-old mother of three — who gave birth to a second baby boy in April — is worth at least £5 million, or $7 million, according to global wealth-tracking firm Wealth-X, though some estimates put her net worth as high as £7.3 million, or $10 million. Middleton’s wealth is mostly in cash because she doesn’t have a personal portfolio of property or artwork.  That being said, Middleton’s net worth is a lot less than her prince — Wealth-X estimates Prince William’s net worth is at least $30 million, though some reports put his fortune closer to $40 million. According to Wealth-X, $19 million of Prince William’s wealth is in cash. The wealth tracking firm also noted that William has an expensive helicopter fit for a royal — an Augusta A109S Grand helicopter which is valued at $11 million.  Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, Prince George of Cambridge and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge arrive for a children's party for Military families during the Royal Tour of Canada on September 29, 2016 in Victoria, Canada. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  What do we know about Kate Middleton’s money?  Most of Middleton’s net worth stems from Party Pieces, an online party supplies business started by her parents. The company is estimated to be worth around £30 million, or $50 million, thanks in no small part to the exposure it gets from being associated with the royals, according to royal expert Marlene Koenig.  Prior to her life as a full-time duchess, Middleton worked for the family business and was a part-time accessories buyer for a retailer called Jigsaw.  Growing up, Kate and her two siblings, Pippa and James Middleton, attended expensive privates schools from a young age, with years of tuition for just one child estimated to be at least £250,000, or $350,000. Kate met Prince William while in college in Scotland at the prestigious University of St. Andrew’s. She graduated in 2005 with a degree in Art History.  How did Kate Middleton’s net worth change after marrying Prince William?  Joining the royal family meant that Middleton was marrying into an incredible $88 billion fortune amassed over generations.  Before Will and Kate became the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and moved into a 20-room apartment in Kensington Palace, Kate lived in an apartment purchased by her parents in the Chelsea neighborhood of London believed to be worth £1 million, or $1.4 million.  Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge smile following their marriage at Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011 in London, England. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  But once Kate officially became a royal she didn’t need to spend much of her own money anymore. Most of her living costs are covered by the private estate Prince Charles manages, the Duchy of Cornwall. The revenue from the Duchy of Cornwall pays for the most of Prince Charles and his family’s royal expenses: things like official travel, wardrobe, housing and staff costs. When Meghan Markle marries Prince Harry on May 19, she too, will get to keep most of her own money — her net worth is believed to be about $5 million — as the Duchy of Cornwall will also absorb the majority of her living costs associated with royal responsibilities.  What is the ‘Kate effect’?  As the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate sets fashion trends all over the world. While she herself does not retain any income from the flurry of economic activity set off by the designer clothes she wears for public appearances, she has triggered what is known as “the Kate Effect,” ","Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, did not always hold royal status. However, even prior to her marriage to Prince William, Kate Middleton possessed a noteworthy net worth. Middleton enjoyed a comfortable upbringing and became the first commoner to wed into the royal family in 2011. Following her marriage, Middleton's net worth experienced significant growth. Here is a comprehensive overview of Middleton's financial standing:

What is the net worth of Kate Middleton? According to Wealth-X, a global wealth-tracking firm, the 36-year-old mother of three, who recently gave birth to a second baby boy in April, is valued at a minimum of £5 million or $7 million. However, alternative estimates place her net worth as high as £7.3 million, or $10 million. It is important to note that the majority of Middleton's wealth exists in liquid assets, as she does not possess a personal real estate or art portfolio.

That being said, it is important to acknowledge that Middleton's net worth is significantly lower than that of her husband, Prince William. Wealth-X estimates Prince William's net worth to be at least $30 million, although some reports speculate that his fortune may reach closer to $40 million. Out of this total, $19 million is attributed to liquid assets. Wealth-X also highlights the fact that Prince William possesses a high-value helicopter, the Augusta A109S Grand, which is valued at $11 million.

What do we know about Kate Middleton's sources of income? The majority of Middleton's net worth originates from her parents' online party supplies business, Party Pieces. This company is estimated to hold a valuation of around £30 million, or $50 million, largely due to the exposure it receives through its association with the royal family. Prior to her marriage, Middleton was employed by the family business and worked as a part-time accessories buyer for the retailer Jigsaw. Additionally, Middleton and her siblings, Pippa and James Middleton, received an expensive private education, with tuition fees for a single child estimated to be at least £250,000, or $350,000.

Kate Middleton entered into a marriage that provided her access to a tremendous fortune amassed over generations. As the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, they now reside in a 20-room apartment in Kensington Palace. Prior to this, Kate lived in an apartment purchased by her parents in the affluent Chelsea neighborhood of London, which is believed to be worth £1 million, or $1.4 million.

After officially becoming a member of the royal family, Kate's personal expenses decreased significantly. The majority of her living costs are covered by the private estate managed by Prince Charles, known as the Duchy of Cornwall. The revenue generated by the Duchy of Cornwall assumes most of the financial responsibility for Prince Charles and his immediate family, including official travel expenses, wardrobe costs, housing, and staff salaries. Similarly, when Meghan Markle marries Prince Harry, it is anticipated that the Duchy of Cornwall will also bear the majority of her living costs associated with her royal duties. Markle's estimated net worth is deemed to be around $5 million.

What is the impact of the 'Kate effect'? As the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate has become a global fashion icon, with her style choices influencing trends worldwide. While she does not personally profit from the economic activity generated by the designer clothes she wears for public appearances, she has sparked a phenomenon known as ""the Kate Effect."""

The former Olympian previously known as Bruce confirmed in her book ""The Secrets of My Life,"" coming out on Tuesday, that the 2017 ""surgery was a success.""  And Jenner said on the ABC interview, she had ""no regrets, none whatsoever.""  Beyond that, Jenner didn't want to talk about the details, telling Sawyer, ""I’m not going to dwell on that subject. It's not an appropriate question to ask a trans person.""  But nothing else was off-limits, as Sawyer caught up with Jenner nearly two years after the TV journalist had done their last emotional interview. Then, the ex-athlete stunned the world by revealing how he had lived a lie. Inside, ex-decathlon champ Jenner had always identified as a woman.  Since then, Jenner said she has been ""happy, peaceful…all of that confusion has left me….I did the right thing"" -- and doesn't miss ""Bruce"" a bit.  Sporting red nails and stylishly feminine clothing, Jenner recalled how—when he was still known as Bruce--he had put an instruction in his will: ""When I'm buried, I want to be dressed as her 'cause that's the way I'm going to heaven.""  As many know from her former reality show, ""I Am Cait,"" Jenner is a Republican and she confided to Sawyer, ""Yes, I did vote for Trump.""  Jenner was initially impressed with Trump for reaching out to transgender people at the Republican National Convention and noted, ""He wanted me to come play golf with him.""  But Jenner got upset when President Trump's administration revoked the federal guidelines that allowed public school students to use bathrooms corresponding to their gender identity--believing it's an issue best left to state and local authorities to decide.  ""It was extremely disappointing…you mess with my community, you don't give us equality and a fair shot, I'm coming after you,"" Jenner sighed about President Trump's decision.  Although Jenner has had her jawline, forehead, and breasts worked on, she insists she's always been a woman because what's important is ""what's between your ears.""  Jenner said she's fine with her ex-wife, Kris Jenner, and stays in touch with all her kids while they pursue their own lives.  ""Nobody calls that much. I reach out to them,"" commented the former ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians"" star.  Jenner told Sawyer that she has ""never been on a date"" in the two years since she came out as transgender, and doesn't really see dating in her future.  Instead, Jenner is most focused on helping the transgender community through charities and building awareness about discrimination and other issues.  ""I want to fight this fight,"" she vowed.

The renowned former Olympian, previously known as Bruce, has confirmed the success of her 2017 surgery in her upcoming book, ""The Secrets of My Life."" During the interview, Jenner expressed no regrets whatsoever regarding her decision and declined to discuss the specifics of the procedure, citing its personal nature and the inappropriate nature of the question when directed towards trans individuals. However, Sawyer's interview covered other important aspects of Jenner's journey, occurring almost two years after their previous emotionally charged conversation. Back then, Jenner's revelation about living a life that contradicted her true identity shocked the world. Jenner has since found contentment and tranquility, explaining that the confusion she once experienced has dissipated entirely. Additionally, Jenner emphasized her lack of attachment to her former identity as Bruce and appeared before Sawyer in a fashionable, feminine attire, complete with red nails. Furthermore, Jenner recounted a request made in her will: to be dressed as a woman during her burial, as it aligns with her true self. Despite her political affiliation as a Republican, Jenner expressed disappointment when President Trump's administration revoked guidelines that enabled public school students to use restrooms corresponding to their gender identity. Believing that such matters should be determined by state and local authorities, Jenner vowed to take a stand against any infringement on the rights and equality of her community. Although Jenner has undergone various cosmetic procedures such as changes to her jawline, forehead, and breasts, she asserts that her gender has always been female. She maintains a good relationship with her ex-wife Kris Jenner and stays in touch with her children while respecting their individual pursuits. Jenner revealed that she has not embarked on dating since coming out as transgender two years ago and does not anticipate doing so in the future. Instead, Jenner dedicates her efforts to assisting the transgender community through charitable endeavors and raising awareness about discrimination and related issues.

The singer is looking out for her girl, Khloe Kardashian, and wants her to know she’s risking ‘serious heartbreak’ trusting Tristan Thompson with his ex. Read on for all the EXCLUSIVE details.  Iggy Azalea, 26, knows a lot about heartbreak when it comes to dealing with men. Especially, those who are still connected to their exes. That said, The New Classic artist is trying to get word to Khloe Kardashian, 32, that Tristan Thompson, 25, may break her heart if she’s not careful.  “Iggy’s not trying to be salty or hate on Tristan but she’s hit up French [Montana], and told her he needs to put Khloe up on game and warn her that she’s putting herself at risk for serious heartbreak with him,” a source close to Iggy told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “Iggy explained to French that these basketball players are no joke and don’t care whose heart they break in their quest to bang every girl that breathes.”  “Iggy still feels some type of way after Nick [Young] cheated on her and then on top of that got his baby mama pregnant – again,” the source continued. “She’s sticking to the girl code and would hate for Khloe to experience the same type of pain she did. She’s hoping French gets to her before it’s too late.”  As HollywoodLife.com previously reported, it’s really hard for KoKo to ignore the rumors that TT and his baby mama, Jordy Craig, are still hooking up. In fact, we’re told Khloe’s hired some private eyes to keep tabs on her dude. “She loves Tristan wholeheartedly and he’s been nothing but a stand-up, loving man,” another source told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “But she can’t help but worry sometimes. Khloe spends as much time in Cleveland as possible and has spies in every city his team plays in.”  HollywoodLifers, do you think Khloe will listen to Iggy?","International Women's Day has come and gone, but Iggy Azalea is determined to keep its significance alive. The singer is expressing concern for her friend Khloe Kardashian and wants to make her aware of the potential for heartbreak by trusting Tristan Thompson, who has a past with his ex. 

Having experienced her fair share of heartbreak with men who maintain connections with their previous partners, Iggy Azalea, 26, is reaching out to Khloe Kardashian, 32, to warn her about the possibility of getting her heartbroken by Tristan Thompson, 25, if she's not cautious. 

According to a source close to Iggy, she has contacted French Montana to ensure Khloe is aware of the risks involved with Tristan. Iggy explained to French that basketball players like Tristan can be ruthless and indifferent to the hearts they break, as they pursue relationships with every available woman. 

The source continued, revealing that Iggy still carries emotional pain from Nick Young's infidelity and subsequent fathering of a child with his previous partner. Adhering to the principles of loyalty among women, Iggy does not want Khloe to endure the same kind of anguish, and she hopes that French can reach her before it is too late. 

As previously reported by HollywoodLife.com, Khloe struggles to ignore the rumors linking Tristan to his baby mama, Jordy Craig. In response to these allegations, Khloe has hired private investigators to monitor Tristan's activities. Although she believes in Tristan's love and commitment, Khloe cannot help but worry at times. She has made it a priority to be present in Cleveland as much as possible and has informants in every city where Tristan's team plays. 

Do you think Khloe will take Iggy's advice into consideration?"
gossipcop-5251247668,1,0,"Despite rumors of a split, Rihanna is still very much together with boyfriend of one year Hassan Jameel. We’ve got the pics of their steamy Mexican getaway  Rihanna has kept her one year romance with Saudi billionaire Hassan Jameel super private. So when rumors surfaced in June that they had broken up fans were waiting to see proof they were still a couple. They got it on July 9 when pics surfaced of the 30-year-old singer and the businessman on a sexy Mexican getaway. The two appeared to be locked in a animated conversation as bikini clad RiRi is seen pointing her right index finger in the air with her mouth open, looking like she had something important to say. In another pic Hassan is seen looking back at her with his hand on his chest as if they’re involved in a somewhat heated conversation. CLICK HERE to see all the pics.  On June 1 MediaTakeOut claimed RiRi had dumped Hassan. The site reported that “Rihanna just got tired of him. She gets tired of men sometimes,” an alleged insider told them. They said that the handsome billionaire wasn’t doing too well after the split. “Of course Rihanna broke his heart. That’s what she does — break men’s hearts.” Since Rihanna has never commented on her romance with Hassan and goes to great lengths to keep their relationship away from the public eye, MTO’s report spread like wildfire.  Obviously something is still on between Rihanna and Hassan, as they are having a hot summer together. They were first photographed a year ago making out in a pool in Spain. They’ve only been pictured a handful of times since, keeping their love undercover. The “Work” singer’s previous relationship was with Drake, 31, and it played out in public. He even professed his years of love to her in front of the world while presenting her with the Video Vanguard award at the 2016 VMAs. After having the public know all about their dating business, Ri has wisely kept her romance with Hassan as far out of the public eye as possible.  Rihanna revealed recently that Drake gushing about her on live TV made her cringe. In a May 2018 interview with Vogue, she said “Waiting through that speech was probably the most uncomfortable part. I don’t like too many compliments; I don’t like to be put on blast.” As for where she stands with Drizzy, she told the mag that they haven’t spoken and that “We don’t have a friendship now, but we’re not enemies either. It is what it is.” However she did come the close to discussing her relationship with Hassan, telling the publication that she dating and she is happy. “I used to feel guilty about taking personal time,” she revealed, “but I also think I never met someone who was worth it before,” she said about her romance with Hassan.","Rihanna and Hassan Jameel's relationship remains strong, despite rumors suggesting otherwise. The couple, who have been together for a year, have kept their love affair extremely private. This led to speculation in June that they had split, leaving fans eagerly awaiting proof of their continued togetherness. On July 9, such evidence emerged with pictures from their intimate getaway in Mexico.

In these photographs, the 30-year-old singer and the Saudi billionaire showcase their deep connection. Rihanna can be seen animatedly pointing her right index finger in the air while engaged in what appears to be a meaningful conversation. Hassan reciprocates this intensity, looking back at her with his hand on his chest, clearly engaged in a passionate discussion. The images speak volumes about the strength of their bond.

It is worth noting that earlier this year, Rihanna's previous relationship with Drake played out very publicly. The contrast is stark with her current romance, as she has gone to great lengths to keep her love with Hassan away from the prying eyes of the media. This commitment to privacy has only fueled speculation and rumors, exemplified by MediaTakeOut's claim that the couple had separated. Despite such rumors, it is evident that Rihanna and Hassan are enjoying a scorching summer together, relishing the privacy they have deliberately cultivated.

In a recent interview with Vogue, Rihanna admitted feeling uncomfortable when Drake publically expressed his love for her, stating that she doesn't appreciate excessive compliments and being put in the spotlight. Regarding her current relationship, she revealed that she is dating and happy, suggesting that her romance with Hassan is a significant departure from her previous experiences. In her words, she disclosed, ""I used to feel guilty about taking personal time, but I also think I never met someone who was worth it before."" This statement is a powerful testament to the depth of her relationship with Hassan.

In conclusion, Rihanna and Hassan Jameel's relationship not only endures but flourishes. Their commitment to privacy showcases a level of maturity and understanding that is often absent in the world of celebrity relationships. As they continue to support and cherish each other, it is clear that their love remains strong and steadfast."
gossipcop-6909849467,1,0,"Now, it’s official: Star Wars fans will have one final chance to say goodbye to Carrie Fisher, with Lucasfilm announcing that the actress, who died in December 2016, will appear in next year’s Star Wars: Episode IX.  In a statement, director J.J. Abrams sought to put concerns about potential CGI resurrections to rest, saying that the new movie will use “unseen footage we shot together in Episode VII” and assuring fans that “we were never going to recast, or use a CG character.” While this is, undoubtedly, comforting, it would also appear to offer particular clues about the role Fisher — or, more specifically, her character, Leia Organa — will play in the movie.  Firstly: Purely for practical purposes, Leia’s presence in the movie will be small. If nothing else, there can’t be that much extraneous, unseen footage from 2015's Star Wars: The Force Awakens; she was barely in that movie, so unless large swaths of scenes were shot but never even hinted at by anyone involved in the production, there’s limited material to draw from in the first place, and surely not everything available will be used.  Considering the context of the footage, it also limits the potential use for Episode IX. Leia appeared in few scenes and locations in The Force Awakens. Leia was on Takodana, rescuing Han, Chewbacca, Rey and Finn, and then at the Resistance base on D’Qar, where she takes part in planning, and later monitoring, the attack on Starkiller Base. Aside from brief interludes with Han and, later, Rey, she’s very much in “harried leader” mode throughout the movie. Does this mean that this is the Leia we’ll see in Episode IX, even after losing her ex-husband, and then her brother, in the previous two movies?  (It’s possible that the Fisher footage will end up being just a minor flashback, used to punctuate a contemporary moment; memories during her funeral, as some on social media have already suggested. If so, then the above problem is side-stepped, to a degree.)  Abrams’ comments leave space for some level of postproduction trickery to be applied to the Fisher footage. Presumably, Fisher will be intercut with new footage of actors shot specifically for Episode IX. Will digital trickery be used to make sure that Fisher shares a location with the other cast members? If so, will that be all that’s altered? What about costuming choices? For that matter, what about the potential for posthumous dubbing or soundalikes used for dialogue where Leia is off-camera or not in close-up? Abrams said that the movie would never use a CG character, but what about a performance augmented or altered by CG?  Of course, if any such edits or alterations are made, they’ll have to be done with subtlety and sensitivity. This is key to the entire enterprise of including footage of Fisher posthumously. For as much as fans want to be able to say goodbye to the actress, and also to Leia, they want to do so in a manner that feels appropriate and respectful to both. While Abrams and Lucasfilm — and Fisher’s family, especially daughter Billie Lourd, named in Abrams’ statement — want to provide both closure and tribute to Leia and Fisher alike with this move, they’re courting backlash if this isn’t done perfectly.  That the footage will come from The Force Awakens feels particularly fitting, then; that, after all, was a project that already came with expectations and looming accusations from fandom expecting the worst. It’s also perhaps a reminder that those involved with this move love the mythology — and loved Fisher as a person — as much as anyone else, if not more so, and will be approaching it with the utmost care.  Everyone will, inevitably, remain worried until the final product appears onscreen, but perhaps we can rest just slightly in the meantime.","In an official announcement, Lucasfilm has confirmed that Star Wars fans will be given a final opportunity to bid farewell to the late Carrie Fisher in next year’s Star Wars: Episode IX. Director J.J. Abrams sought to allay concerns about the use of CGI technology, assuring fans that the film will incorporate unused footage that was originally captured during Episode VII. Abrams emphasized that there will be no recasting or reliance on computer-generated characters. While this news is undeniably reassuring, it also provides some insights into the extent of Fisher's appearance in the movie, specifically as her character, Leia Organa. 

It is important to note that due to practical limitations, Leia's presence in Episode IX will be minimal. Considering that there is unlikely to be a surplus of unused footage from Star Wars: The Force Awakens in 2015, as Fisher had limited screen time in that film, it is safe to assume that only a fraction of the available material will be utilized. This constraint raises questions regarding the role Leia will play in the upcoming film. In The Force Awakens, Leia was primarily portrayed as a determined leader, with her scenes centered on the rescue mission and battle preparation at various locations. Given the events of the previous two movies, losing her ex-husband and brother, will Leia still embody this role in Episode IX? 

One plausible speculation circulating on social media is that the Fisher footage may be utilized as brief flashbacks during significant moments or even in a memorial context. This approach could alleviate the challenge mentioned earlier. However, it is worth noting that Abrams' remarks suggest the possibility of utilizing post-production techniques to seamlessly integrate the Fisher footage with new scenes featuring the cast. This raises further questions: Will digital manipulations harmonize Fisher's presence with her co-stars? Will costuming choices present any challenges? And could posthumous dubbing or voice doubles be employed to depict dialogue in scenes where Leia is not on-screen or in close-up shots? Although Abrams has pledged not to employ a CG character, utilizing CG to enhance or modify Fisher's performance remains a potential consideration. 

Of course, any modifications made to the footage will need to be executed delicately and with the utmost sensitivity. Achieving this balance is crucial to the entire endeavor of including Fisher's posthumous presence in the film. Fans want to bid farewell to both the actress and the character she portrayed, and it is imperative that this is done in a manner that is fitting and respectful. Abrams, Lucasfilm, and Fisher's family, particularly her daughter Billie Lourd, who was mentioned in Abrams' statement, are determined to offer closure and pay tribute to both Leia and Fisher. Nonetheless, any missteps in the execution of these intentions could lead to backlash and disappointment. 

Given the source of the footage from The Force Awakens, it is poignant that this project, like its predecessor, carries high expectations and potential skepticism from the fandom. This also serves as a reminder that those involved in this endeavor share the deep appreciation for the Star Wars mythology and held Fisher in high regard, perhaps even more so than the fans themselves. Rest assured, the utmost care will be taken to handle this delicate situation. 

While concerns will inevitably persist until the final product is unveiled onscreen, we can, for now, find some solace in knowing that every effort will be made to execute this tribute flawlessly."

The talk show host on Sunday posted a photo on Instagram of him and his wife boarding a private jet.  “Vacation time is here, let’s go girl,” he captioned the Sunday, July 8 image.  The photo, which was similar to one Marjorie posted on her Instagram Story, got praise from fans.  “God bless….. stay focus[ed] don’t [lose] the vision🙏💍.”  “Enjoy yourselves, you guys deserve this vacation. Come back well rested and a stronger bond and marriage. Yahoo for the Harveys.”  Days earlier, RadarOnline reported that Marjorie walked out on Steve because he had been getting close with Kris Jenner during closed-door business meetings and ongoing phone calls and text messages.  “There was a huge blowout fight and Marjorie walked out threatening divorce,” a source told the gossip site of the reported split. “There’s no way she was going to put up with Steve hanging around a man-eater like Kris — especially since he’s proven time and again he can’t be trusted.”  Although Jenner was reportedly just stringing Steve along to get tips on TV success, one of his former talk show employes said Marjorie knows her man, who is twice divorced and cheated on both wives with the next.  “Steve has a wandering eye and he loves women!” the ex-worker told Radar anonymously. “He’s cheated during his previous marriages, and Marjorie knows he could do it again. She knows her man’s weakness — knows everything about him! That’s why she watches him so closely.”  The rumor was the talk of Twitter.  “Am I late?? Did everyone know Steve Harvey is being accused of cheating on Marjorie with Kris Jenner?! I didn’t know this 😂.”  “Steve Harvey left his wife to marry Marjorie, his side b—- of 20 years, and now she’s leaving him and running his pockets. Hilarious. Karma’s a bad b—-.”  “Boyyy if this Steve Harvey rumor is true… he gon be sick for a minute. He loves him some Marjorie.”","Steve Harvey recently addressed and debunked a rumor that circulated last week, alleging that he and his wife Marjorie Harvey were on the verge of a $400 million divorce.

This image, which resembled one posted by Marjorie on her Instagram Story, received positive feedback from their fans. One fan wished them blessings and encouraged them to stay focused and not lose sight of their vision, while another expressed their excitement for the couple, hoping their vacation would strengthen their bond and marriage. In contrast to these supportive comments, the rumor previously reported by Radar Online claimed that Marjorie had left Steve due to his alleged close relationship with Kris Jenner during undisclosed business meetings and ongoing communication. According to an anonymous source, Marjorie supposedly walked out after a heated argument, stating that she had no intentions of tolerating Steve associating with someone like Kris. This source further alleged that Steve, who has a history of infidelity, had a weakness for women and that Marjorie, being aware of it, closely monitors his actions. The rumor quickly became a topic of discussion on Twitter, with users expressing surprise at the news and sharing their opinions. Despite the speculation, Steve Harvey's recent Instagram post seems to dismiss any truth to the rumors, showcasing a united front between him and his wife as they embark on a well-deserved vacation."

gossipcop-8854037683,1,0,"Titanic II is set to launch in less than two years — not in movie theaters, but on the open sea.  A replica of the world’s most famous “unsinkable” ship — which struck an iceberg and sank on its maiden voyage on April 15, 1912, killing 1,503 people — is under construction, with a maiden voyage planned for 2018.  Australian tycoon and politician Clive Palmer — not J. Bruce Ismay — is at the helm of the ambitious project to faithfully recreate the luxury ship, which will be about 13 feet wider to meet current regulations.  More importantly, it will carry enough lifeboats for every passenger and its hull will be welded, not riveted, just in case it comes across a rogue iceberg, the Belfast Telegraph reports.  “The new Titanic will of course have modern evacuation procedures, satellite controls, digital navigation and radar systems and all those things you’d expect on a 21st-century ship,” James McDonald, global marketing director of Palmer’s company, Blue Star Line, told the paper.  The new nine-deck ship will be 885 feet long, about two more than her doomed predecessor, 174 feet high and have a maximum speed of 24 knots. She will accommodate 2,400 passengers — 177 more than the RMS Titanic.  It also will feature the same categories of passengers — from the first-class movers and shakers to the hoi polloi in third class, where poor Leonardo DiCaprio was berthed in the classic movie.  Unlike the Belfast-built original, the Titanic II is under construction by the CSC Jinling Shipyard in Jiangsu, China.  Its maiden voyage will not be from Southampton to New York, but rather from Jiangsu, China, to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, the paper reported.  Some of the dead passengers’ relatives have criticized the plans for a new Titanic, but Blue Star has reportedly been flooded with requests for tickets — with some offering up to about $900,000 for a spot on the first trip.","The launch of Titanic II is imminent, and it will not be a cinematic spectacle but rather a voyage across the open sea. This replica of the renowned ""unsinkable"" vessel, famous for its tragic encounter with an iceberg on its inaugural journey on April 15, 1912, resulting in the loss of 1,503 lives, is currently being constructed. The maiden voyage of this ambitious undertaking, spearheaded by Australian tycoon and politician Clive Palmer, is scheduled for 2018. 

To meet contemporary regulations, this faithful recreation of the luxurious ship will be approximately 13 feet wider. Furthermore, it will have sufficient lifeboat capacity for all passengers, and its hull will be welded as a precautionary measure against potential iceberg encounters. These significant modifications, as reported by the Belfast Telegraph, ensure the safety of the vessel. 

James McDonald, the global marketing director of Blue Star Line, Palmer's company, affirmed that the new Titanic will embody modern advancements in technology. This includes implementing updated evacuation procedures, satellite controls, digital navigation systems, and radar technology that are expected for a ship of the 21st century. 

The newly constructed ship, boasting nine decks, will measure 885 feet in length, surpassing its ill-fated predecessor by two feet. With a height of 174 feet and a maximum speed of 24 knots, it will accommodate 2,400 passengers, 177 more than the RMS Titanic. In keeping with the original vessel, Titanic II will cater to different passenger classes, ranging from the opulent first class to the common folk in third class, reminiscent of the iconic movie featuring Leonardo DiCaprio. 

Unlike the original ship, which was built in Belfast, Titanic II is being constructed at the CSC Jinling Shipyard in Jiangsu, China. Its maiden voyage will depart from Jiangsu, China, and make its way to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, as reported by the aforementioned publication. 

While some relatives of the deceased passengers have expressed dissent towards the plans for a new Titanic, Blue Star Line has been inundated with ticket requests. According to reports, some individuals have even offered up to approximately $900,000 for a chance to be part of the ship's inaugural journey."

Where do they come from and who are these “sources”? Hummmm.”  In fairness, Khloe may not have been referring to this story in particular. But she also may very well have been. You get me?  Khloe still hasn’t directly commented on the Tristan situation, but she certainly has been posting some super-cryptic quotes on her social media, which give us absolutely no insight into what the hell is going on.

Always try to give without expectations. Whether that be something tangible or emotional.”  Then yesterday she went on Instagram Stories to write: “Your mind will always believe everything you tell it. Feed it faith. Feed it truth. Feed it with love.”  And then: “Nobody cares about your story until you win.

According to the supposed insider, Khloe has expressed her desire to eventually tie the knot, but there have been no serious discussions about a wedding taking place. Nevertheless, she envisions a future with Thompson and firmly believes that they can overcome their challenges, ensuring a fulfilling life together.

Last week, she tweeted, ""You will never ever regret being kind to someone."" In response to a comment suggesting that kindness may go unappreciated by some, Khloe replied, ""Never give to get. Always try to give without expectations, be it tangible or emotional.""

More recently, she took to Instagram Stories to share some profound thoughts: ""Your mind will always believe everything you tell it. Feed it faith. Feed it truth. Feed it with love."" She followed up with, ""Nobody cares about your story until you win. So win.""

That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired. T","Katie Holmes finds herself in a challenging situation, as numerous reports surrounding her personal life continue to circulate. These reports revolve around her romantic involvement with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, her ex-husband Tom Cruise, and their daughter Suri. According to RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of a wedding ceremony worth $300,000, where Suri would serve as the bridesmaid. This union would have solidified their five-year relationship, which has largely remained concealed from the public eye. However, it seems that Holmes became aware of Foxx's reluctance to abandon his flirtatious tendencies, including maintaining a friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother of his daughter. RadarOnline alleges that Foxx attended Leonardo DiCaprio's birthday party with Grannis, not Holmes. Consequently, Holmes made the decision to call off the wedding and privately informed Foxx of their separation. A source cited by RadarOnline claims that Foxx rejected the idea of signing a prenuptial agreement with a no-cheating clause, as he began to understand the potential consequences of being unfaithful to his partner. Holmes grew concerned about Foxx's behavior, recognizing the lack of respect and the detrimental effect it could have on herself and Suri. Meanwhile, Holmes has supposedly faced ongoing attempts by Cruise, her ex-husband and Hollywood superstar, to regain a place in their daughter Suri's life. Despite not having seen his daughter for over five years due to the restrictions imposed by his Church of Scientology, Cruise allegedly regrets his absence and wishes to play a more active role in Suri's life, according to reports in Hollywood Life based on Star magazine. The Star cites an insider who claims that Cruise, being a devoted Scientologist, unquestioningly complied with the instructions of church leaders who prohibited him from seeing Suri. However, Cruise has grown tired of being manipulated by these authorities and desires a reunion with his daughter. The Star also discloses an alleged agreement between Holmes and Cruise, wherein Holmes vowed to keep quiet about Cruise and the Church of Scientology, on the condition that Cruise steers clear of their daughter and avoids attempting to indoctrinate her into the controversial religious organization. Nevertheless, Holmes feels torn between her desire to protect Suri and the possibility of mending the relationship between father and daughter. As an insider informed the Star, Holmes is gradually considering the idea of a reunion, understanding that Suri may be yearning for her father's presence. Holmes is starting to trust Cruise's assurance that he will refrain from involving their daughter in his religious beliefs. Representatives for Holmes have dismissed both the reports of her breakup with Foxx and the potential reunion between Cruise and Suri. Notably, Holmes' publicist, Leslie Sloane, personally denies the breakup report and attaches her name to the statement. This denial holds significance, as it represents the first official acknowledgement, on record, from either Holmes or Foxx that their relationship exists. Holmes and Foxx have gone to great lengths to keep their relationship under wraps since they reportedly began dating in 2013. Holmes even disguised herself once to meet Foxx at a restaurant to avoid public attention. These measures were necessary as part of Holmes' divorce settlement with Cruise, which legally obligated her not to date anyone publicly for five years after their separation, as reported in September 2017. Speculation arose when Holmes and Foxx were photographed together on a Malibu beach, hand in hand, suggesting that they were aware of the paparazzi's presence and that the five-year public dating ban had expired."
