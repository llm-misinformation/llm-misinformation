Dancing With the Stars will return for its 22nd season with Len Goodman back where he belongs, Bindi Irwin as the reigning champ, and a baby boy or girl for Allison Holker. There's much to look forward to, but not before we close out this season one last time with everything that happened after the finale! (In case you missed it, you can read our recap of the best and worst moments here .) Almost an hour after Tom Bergeron declared Bindi Irwin and Derek Hough the winners of season 21, Bindi was still in disbelief, shouting from the top of her lungs, ""I think I'm going to scream for 20 minutes!"" Her exuberance and genuine nature endeared her to literally every one on set, but no one more so than Derek. ""It's just so special with Bindi,"" he told reporters backstage. ""She's a champion of life."" Bindi shared the same sentiment, telling those in the ballroom that she gained another brother in Derek. In case you needed further proof that the two are friends for life, consider this: Derek's hopping on a plane to Australia in a couple weeks ""to tackle crocodiles and get my official khakis!"" The Houghster may have nabbed his sixth Mirrorball trophy, but it was his partnership with Bindi that undoubtedly made it his favorite season. ""There's not a thing I would change about this season,"" he told Glamour post-show. ""There's not a week I would change, a dance I would change, and that was a very calming, very peaceful feeling. The show is a completely different show than the first time I won, and to win at this level and the standard that this show has been raised to, it's been incredible."" While Bindi and Derek make the press rounds in New York City, it's no secret that she's itching to get back to her hometown down under. ""I can't wait to get back to all the animals, continue all the conservation work, and carry on in my dad's footsteps."" Season 21 runner-ups Sharna Burgess and Nick Carter were understandably disappointed not to win the big prize, but they both praised Bindi and Derek for their phenomenal journey this season. ""Bindi was the whole package,"" praised the red-haired stunner. ""She and Derek had a beautiful partnership."" Still, ""it's bittersweet in may ways. Did I really want this to be my first Mirrorball? Absolutely. I would be lying if I said I didn't. But Bindi was undeniable this entire season. She grew so much, and she's just such a beautiful person you can't help but be captivated by her. Both [she and Nick] are winners, and I truly believe that."" Echoed Nick: ""It was just such a pleasure to be here. I didn't expect to get anything, so anytime something great happened in the competition, it was a pleasant surprise to me."" So what's up next for Nick? Well, aside from getting ready for Baby Boy Carter , his solo album ( All American ) drops today, and he has a movie coming out next year that he wrote and directed. As for third-place contestant, Alek Skarlatos , he'll be heading on the DWTS Tour this winter, but his immediate plans are much simpler: ""I can't wait to get on the plane tonight to eat. A lot."" But what about his dating life? Any updates on that? ""It's been pretty crazy, honestly. [I haven't had time] for many dates lately."" Added Lindsay: ""I'll be his wing woman on tour!"" During all the hectic action backstage, Allison Holker was a ball of energy, especially for someone six month's pregnant. ""I feel incredible!"" gushed the pro. ""Dancing around with a baby that's the size of a football in your belly is never an easy task, but it's been amazing. Although I never expected to see myself in a sparkly costume on the Dancing With the Stars stage six months pregnant!"" Allison (and husband tWitch) will find out the baby's gender on December 10, ""which is our anniversary too."" In case you're wondering, she'll reveal whether it's a boy or a girl on social media shortly thereafter! In the meantime, Allison's prepping for her first Thanksgiving in charge of the turkey as long as the ne","by: Sarah Johnson

gossipcop-2761931201,1,0,"Lou Rocco/Getty Images  How Michael Strahan’s net worth was built  Michael Strahan has grown his wealth through 14 years of playing pro football and his second career as a talk-show host.  The son of an Army major, Strahan grew up in Germany and did not play competitive high school football until his senior year when his parents sent him to live with his aunt and uncle in Texas.  The former defensive end played well enough to earn a scholarship to Texas Southern University. By his senior year of college, he had set a record for sacks, which got the attention of the NFL.  In 1993, the New York Giants drafted Strahan as the 40th overall draft pick. Over the next 14 seasons, he became the league’s all-time quarterback sack leader, played in the Pro Bowl and helped the Giants defeat the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLII.  Upon retiring in 2008, Strahan concentrated on his off-field talents. In 2012, he became Kelly Ripa’s “Live! With Kelly” co-host, replacing longtime host Regis Philbin. Four years later, he left the show and joined ABC’s “Good Morning America”; it took more than a year for “Live” to announce Ryan Seacrest as its new co-host.  Strahan also serves as a Fox NFL Sunday analyst during the football season.  As of May 2017, Strahan’s net worth was $65 million, with a salary of $17 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.

As of April 2016, he is a full-time co-host on ABC’s morning show “Good Morning America.”  Months later, the network hired him to host his own game show, “$100,000 Pyramid,” a reboot of an old classic. The fashionable football star also launched his own clothing line in 2015 in JC Penney stores.  Along with Curt Menefee, Terry Bradshaw, Howie Long and Jimmy Johnson, Strahan appears on “Fox NFL Sunday” each week during the NFL season.  Accolades  Throughout both his college and pro football careers, Strahan had a reputation for sacking quarterbacks, and in 2001, he set the record for most sacks in an NFL season. He also appeared in the Pro Bowl seven times.  In 2008, after his final season in the NFL, he helped lead the New York Giants to a Super Bowl victory over the New England Patriots.  As a morning show host, Strahan has earned two Daytime Emmy Awards for “Outstanding Talk Show Host” for his work on “Live! With Kelly and Michael.”",Strahan earned $70 million from his time with the New York Giants and $45 million from his gig on “Live with Kelly and Ryan.” He's also made money from endorsement deals with brands like Under Armour and Mercedes-Benz.

(This is always an exciting moment in a ceremony.) It was an extraordinary mix of tradition and modernity, of centuries of history and up-to-the moment flourishes. Oprah was here, and so was Meghan’s mother, an African-American social worker who wore a conventional mother-of-the-bride outfit and also a nose stud. It somehow looked charming and just right. The entire royal family was here, along with a complement of English aristocrats and important personages. The music was stately and beautiful. The setting was awe-inspiring. There was a flotilla of clergymen, an extraordinary mélange including the archbishop of Canterbury and — in a striking inclusion in this most ancient of places — the head of the Episcopal Church, the Most Rev. Michael Curry. Chosen to give the address to the congregations, Bishop Curry, who is African-American, quoted Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. His voice rising and falling with emotion, he made a big, generous, impassioned case for love as the most important thing there is, in religion and in life. His address came after a reading by Lady Jane Fellowes, Harry’s aunt (her sister was Diana, Princess of Wales) that was both full of joy and a signal, it seemed, that the sadness in Harry’s life since his mother’s death had finally lifted. It was a passage from the Song of Solomon: “Arise my love, my fair one, and come away; for now the winter is past, the rain is over and gone.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story The dress was a success: sculptural simplicity. Photo Our fashion critic, Vanessa Friedman, is also watching, and she has a quick take for us on Meghan Markle’s dress. It was absolutely simple: pure and sculptural, in double bonded silk cady with a wide boatneck, long sleeves and sweeping train. It was Meghan Markle’s wedding dress. It was by Clare Waight Keller, a British woman and the first female designer of Givenchy. And it was everything people had hoped. This was not a Cinderella choice, not one that spoke of fantasy or old-fashioned fairy tales. Instead, it placed the woman proudly front and center and underscored Ms. Markle’s own independence. At the same time, it celebrated female strength, promoted a local designer and reached a hand across to Europe (where Ms. Waight Keller has a day job). The five-meter veil was of silk tulle, with a trim of hand-embroidered flowers in silk threads and organza, and contained embroidery representing the flora of all 53 Commonwealth nations. Video And it was entirely a surprise. In all the rumors that had swirled around The Dress, from Ralph & Russo to Stella McCartney, Ms. Waight Keller’s name had never come up. In the end, Ms. Markle outthought us all. As this starts, long may it continue. And the After-Party Dress The newly minted Duke and Duchess of Sussex departed Windsor for their evening reception at Frogmore House in a very James Bond fashion. The duchess wore a second dress by designer Stella McCartney. You can read our fashion critic Vanessa Friedman’s reaction here.

Kate and William’s wedding was solemn, stately, stuffy, full of dignitaries, politicians, and the sort of boring personages known here as the great and the good. But this looked totally fun for the guests — even more fun than, say, the Academy Awards — because no one was competing for anything and no one was forced to talk about their outfits to television reporters.

According to Page Six, Lovato was spotted holding hands with Abedini in Disneyland over the weekend, causing fans and media outlets to speculate whether they could be dating. This is only the latest speculation surrounding Lovato’s love life, as the pop singer has never officially confirmed her sexuality– despite alluding to her being bisexual in her song lyrics.

She’s Had Relationships With Several Male Celebrities Lovato, like most notable celebrities, have dated other people in the industry. According to Pop Sugar, she dated The Cab frontman Alex DeLeon from 2008-09, and later based the breakup song “Catch Me” on him. Lovato also had brief flings with Trace Cyrus (Miley’s older brother) in 2009 and Joe Jonas, her self-proclaimed “BFF,” in 2010. Her most notable relationship to date, however, has been with Valderrama, whom she dated from from 2010 to 2016. In an interview with Latina magazine, Lovato discussed what attracted her to the That 70’s Show actor: When I dated white guys, it wasn’t as passionate as my relationship with Wilmer. Maybe that’s just Wilmer. But I do believe that Latin people are just more expressive, more passionate with their emotions. He’s very manly, and he can be stubborn like Latino men can, but he’s protective and he cares so much and loves so hard. I’ve been blessed enough to have him in my life, and not just as my man, but also my best friend. Since her breakup from Valderrama, Lovato’s been seen with MMA fighter Guilherme “Bomba” Vasconcelos and Abedini. 3.

gossipcop-5319163677,1,0,"Come December, it's become near tradition over the past few years for everyone to complain about how the previous 12 months have been the worst ever. This year, however really, really feels like it. This year has been a barrage of bizarre and bummer headlines that at times it's felt like some dystopian nightmare.  It's been so bad that the Kardashian-West clan have just decided to end 2016 early. Yes, Kim and Kanye have decided to cancel all public and professional commitments for the end of the year and plan to maintain their social media blackouts as well. To be exact, a flack told Page Six that Kim and Kanye “plan on taking the rest of 2016 off and spending time as a family.""  Which, frankly, we wish we all could do, don't we?  Is it possible for President Obama's last major act to be an executive decree for us to just all get a chance to chill out and recuperate for the remaining 26 days left in this bummer of a year? Sure, there's no political safeguarding against any potential additional music legends from dying or preventing any further tragedies and disasters from happening or ensuring that some new odd Zika-like disease pops up, but there's got to be something? How about the ""Netflix and Chill Act?"" Just an order that all Americans get to spend the next month relaxing and catching up on any television series they may have missed this year.  Of course, when it comes to Kim and Kanye it's understandable that they've decided to literally cancel the rest of their 2016. Kim was still in the midst of recuperating from being robbed at gunpoint in Paris when her husband Kanye was hospitalized following a very public breakdown.  They've had to endure these private tragedies while also dealing with immense public interest and rumors running rampant in the tabloid press.  E!, the home of the Kardashian's reality TV empire, reports that a family source says ""Kim is doing okay despite reports.""  ""She has many things on her plate so being overwhelmed is expected,"" the source continued. ""She wants to get Kanye back on his feet. She is not leaving him. She loves him.""  Kanye was released from an L.A.-area hospital last week after spending more than a week receiving treatment for exhaustion. Kim West was reportedly by his side throughout the entire ordeal and now wants to make sure Kanye continues to receive therapy and treatment now that he's out of the hospital.  Despite your personal opinion on the pair, it certainly does seem like the family deserves the rest. In addition to their dual ordeal, they also have two young children to care for after all (in fact, today is Saint West's first birthday). Maybe it's best we all let them lay low and chill for the next month or so.  Unfortunately, we all don't have the luxury as much as we wish we could. Then again, it's not looking like 2017 is shaping up to be any better. Hopefully, a rested and healthier Kim and Kanye can get back into form and provide us with the not-quite-as-tragic-as-this distractions we'll probably desperately need in the new year.  Update: Kanye, for one, has now reappeared in public, albeit in a very low-key way. He was spotted with newly blond hair at designer Rick Owens' furniture show in Los Angeles .","Title: 'Worst Year Ever' Complaints Reach New High as December Nears
As the final days of the year approach, a familiar refrain can be heard across the nation: ""This has been the worst year ever."" According to a recent survey, a staggering 90% of Americans are expressing dissatisfaction with the past 12 months, with many citing a range of factors from political turmoil to economic uncertainty.
The trend of widespread discontent has been building over the past few years, with each December bringing a new chorus of complaints about the previous year. While some have dismissed the phenomenon as mere nostalgia, experts say it may be a sign of deeper societal issues.
""People are feeling increasingly frustrated with the state of affairs in the country and around the world,"" said Dr. Jane Smith, a sociologist at XYZ University. ""The constant barrage of negative news and the lack of trust in institutions is taking a toll on people's mental health and well-being.""
The survey, conducted by the XYZ Polling Institute, found that the top reasons for the dissatisfaction were political polarization (cited by 60% of respondents), economic inequality (55%), and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (50%).
As the holiday season approaches, many are bracing themselves for another year of disappointment and disillusionment. ""I'm just ready for this year to be over,"" said Sarah Johnson, a 32-year-old mother of two from New York. ""It's been a rough one, and I'm not looking forward to the next 12 months.""
While the sentiment may be widespread, some experts are urging caution in interpreting the survey results. ""It's important to remember that people's perceptions of the past year are often influenced by their own personal experiences and biases,"" said Dr. John Doe, a psychologist at ABC University. ""Rather than relying solely on surveys, it's important to look at the data from multiple angles and consider the broader social and economic trends at play.""
Despite the grim outlook, there are some signs of hope for the new year. Many experts point to the growing number of people engaging in activism and advocacy as a sign of a growing desire for change. ""People are starting to realize that they have the power to effect change, and that can be a powerful motivator,"" said Dr. Jane Smith.
As the nation braces itself for another year of ""worst year ever"" complaints, there is a sense of unease and uncertainty. But amidst the gloom, there is also a glimmer of hope that the tide may be turning, and that the next 12 months may bring a brighter future."

The groom, Prince Harry, is a member of the British royal family; the bride, Meghan Markle, is an American and former actress.[note 1] On the morning of the wedding, Prince Harry's grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, conferred upon him the titles of Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel. On her marriage, Markle became Duchess of Sussex.[1] The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, officiated at the wedding using the standard Anglican church service for Holy Matrimony published in Common Worship, the liturgical text of the Church of England.[2][3] Announcement of engagement [ edit ] Prince Harry is the second son of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Diana, Princess of Wales. He and Meghan Markle, an American actress best known for her role in the Canadian-American legal-drama television series Suits, have been in a relationship since 2016, having first met in July 2016.[4] The relationship was officially acknowledged on 8 November 2016, when a statement was released from the royal family's communications secretary addressing the ""wave of abuse and harassment"" directed toward Markle.[5] Harry and Meghan attending church on Christmas Day, 2017 On 27 November 2017, Clarence House announced that Prince Harry would marry Markle in the spring of 2018.[6] They were engaged earlier the same month in London, with the Prince giving Markle a bespoke engagement ring made by Cleave and Company, the court jewellers and medalists to the Queen, consisting of a large central diamond from Botswana, with two smaller diamonds from his mother's jewellery collection.[7] At the same time, it was announced that they would live at Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace following their marriage.[8] The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh expressed their delight at the news, while congratulations came in from various political leaders, including the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, and the Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn. After the announcement, the couple gave an exclusive interview to Mishal Husain of BBC News.[8] During the public announcement of the engagement at Kensington Palace's Sunken Gardens, Markle wore a bottle knee-length emerald green dress with bow detailing at the cinched waist by Italian label P.A.R.O.S.H and a white trench coat by Canadian brand Line the Label.[9][10] Hours after the announcement, the website of Line the Label crashed down due to the number of people who were trying to order the coat.[7][11] Markle is the second American[note 2] and the first person of mixed race heritage to marry into the British royal family.[12] The engagement announcement prompted much comment about the possible social significance of Markle becoming a proudly mixed-race royal.[13][14][15][16][17] Under the terms of the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, the first six persons in the line of succession require the Sovereign's consent in order to marry. Harry was fifth in line at the time of his engagement.[18] The Queen's consent was declared to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom on 14 March 2018.[19][20] Although Markle attended a private Catholic school in her early years, she is not Roman Catholic.[21] On 6 March 2018, she was baptised and confirmed into the Church of England by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby at St. James's Palace.[22] Although Markle was divorced, the Anglican Church has permitted marriage to divorced persons with a living spouse since 2002.[23][24] After the engagement, Markle began the years-long process of becoming a British citizen.[25] She will retain her U.S. citizenship during the process,[26] but Kensington Palace have indicated that the decision on whether she will retain dual nationality has not yet been made.[25] Retaining U.S. citizenship is expected to create tax complications.[27] The couple was invited to celebrate Christmas 2017 with th",

The private restaurant has long operated under the radar in Los Angeles, with rumors circulating about who has attended and what is really served behind closed doors. Now a leaked Cannibal Club document has exposed some of the notorious restaurant’s “elite” patrons.  CANNIBALISM ‘MORE POPULAR THAN YOU MIGHT THINK’  Meryl Streep, Chelsea Clinton and CNN’s Anderson Cooper all hold Cannibal Club membership, according to the document. Katy Perry, who has previously said that “Cannibalism is way more popular than you might think” and “human flesh is the best meat“, is also a regular diner.  Boasting that the restaurant is the “cutting edge of experimental cuisine” and serves “L.A.’s cultural elite“, the Cannibal Club website makes clear they “specialize in the preparation of human meat” that comes from “young and healthy bodies.“  Cannibal Club’s visiting chefs “hail from around the world” and come to L.A. to “practice their craft free of compromise and unbounded by convention,” according to the Cannibal Club website.  ‘FILMMAKERS, INTELLECTUALS, AND CELEBRITIES’  “Our exclusive clientele includes noted filmmakers, intellectuals, and celebrities who have embraced the Enlightenment ideals of free expression and rationalism. On event nights, avant-garde performance artists, celebrated literary figures, and ground-breaking musicians entertain our guests.  “At Cannibal Club, we celebrate artistic excellence as the natural and inevitable expression of the unbridled human spirit.“  Describing each dish as a “study in taste and elegance“, Chef de Cuisine Sophie Laffite explains: “The meat we serve is selected from the young and healthy. Consistent with the practice of cannibalism in many primitive societies, we view anthropophagy as homage to the dead, who are reborn into the bodies of their consumers.”  But don’t think you can just walk in there and check the place out. The private restaurant operates a strict vetting policy, according to the website:  “It is necessary for us to operate privately and to vette our members in order to avoid disruption from the less enlightened.“  HUMAN MEAT MENU  The current menu listed on the site includes Sirloin Steak (human meat, flame-broiled 8oz), Liver and Mushroom Pirozhi (“a Russian version of pierogies, baked rather than boiled, with a savory filling of wild mushrooms and human liver“) and Placenta Lasagne (“an otherwise traditional lasagna with one layer of cheese substituted by minced placenta in heirloom tomato sauce, seasoned with garlic, onion and oregano”.)  Elspeth Blake, the Cannibal Club proprietor who claims to have earned her stripes working under Vincent Sardi Jr. in New York, did not immediately respond to our questions regarding where the human flesh comes from.  ‘YOUNG AND HEALTHY BODIES’  In the FAQ section of the website, Cannibal Club claims:  “Most of the businesses and institutions who supply us prefer to keep those relationships discreet. On the individual level, bodies are often bequeathed to us. For some, this is a way to supplement life insurance and offset funerary expenses. For others, such as Cannibal Club member Gwendoline Fenwich, who was served to her friends and relatives at the Club in January of 2008, being prepared as a meal, and thereby reborn into the bodies of the living, is an attractive alternative to the more the traditional practices of burial and cremation.“  The revelation that Hollywood royalty, pop stars and cable TV anchors consume human flesh when they are in Los Angeles is merely the latest example of public figures being exposed as dark figures, reveling in the darkness.

Breaking News: Cannibal Club Scandal Rocks Hollywood
A shocking expose has revealed that several high-profile celebrities, including Katy Perry, Meryl Streep, Anderson Cooper, and Chelsea Clinton, have been frequenting a notorious cannibal restaurant in Los Angeles. According to sources, the celebrities have been secretly dining on human flesh at the exclusive Cannibal Club, located in the city's trendy Silverlake district.
The news has sent shockwaves through the Hollywood elite, with many stars expressing outrage and disbelief at the revelation. ""I can't believe I was duped into eating human meat,"" exclaimed Katy Perry in a statement. ""I thought it was just a weird fusion restaurant.""
Meryl Streep, who was spotted entering the Cannibal Club last week, denied any wrongdoing, insisting that she was simply ""curious about the culinary scene in LA."" Anderson Cooper, who was also seen dining at the restaurant, refused to comment on the matter, but sources close to the CNN anchor suggest that he may have been ""playing a prank"" on his viewers.
Chelsea Clinton, who has been a vocal advocate for human rights, faced intense backlash on social media after the news broke. ""I can't believe I was part of this disgusting club,"" she tweeted. ""I'm so sorry to my followers for letting them down.""
The Cannibal Club, which has been operating under the radar for years, is said to offer a unique dining experience, with menu items including ""human tenderloin"" and ""flesh soup."" The restaurant's owner, who wishes to remain anonymous, has refused to comment on the allegations, citing ""legitimate medical and scientific reasons"" for the use of human flesh.
The scandal has raised questions about the ethics of the restaurant industry and the lengths to which celebrities will go to preserve their privacy and reputations. As the investigation continues, one thing is clear: the world of Hollywood is not as glamorous as it seems."

According to a new report, the Real Housewives of New Jersey star is planning to cash in on her husband Joe Giudice’s deportation proceedings.  If you recall, it was reported weeks ago that a judge had ruled that Joe should be deported upon his release from prison, where he is currently serving a 41-month-prison sentence for bank and wire fraud. Well now, sources are telling Radar Online that Bravo has offered Teresa $500,000 to film a special about his deportation.  “Teresa was offered big bucks to film a special about Joe’s deportation and she agreed to do it,” an insider revealed. “Half a million dollars to share the story on camera.”  And this story is believable because this isn’t Teresa’s first rodeo when it comes to cashing in on her crimes legal drama!  “It is going to be like the other specials when she was in prison and will show how she and Joe and the girls are handling the scary prospect of Joe getting deported,” added the source.  IS TERESA BEGGING PRESIDENT TRUMP TO STOP JOE’S DEPORTATION?  Earlier this year, an Immigration official confirmed that “records show that an immigration judge ordered Mr. Giudice be removed from the United States on March 14, 2018.”  A source close to Teresa adds that she needs the Bravo money as Joe tries to appeal the deportation order.  “Teresa will do anything for the money. She never stops thinking about taking care of her girls and she agreed to this so that they would have money for college. She is a good mom and wants to provide for her children,” the source stated.  Joe will reportedly be turned over to ICE custody upon his March 2019 release, although it is likely he could be released earlier than March which would mean an earlier deportation back to Italy.  UPDATE – Teresa is denying this report. Her attorney, James Leonard, tells the Gossip Cop website that she has no current plans to do a spinoff show about Joe’s possible deportation.

Justin Theroux's Marriage May Be Over, But He's Got Female Company Galore
Los Angeles, CA - In a shocking turn of events, it appears that Justin Theroux's marriage to Jennifer Aniston may be over. However, the 46-year-old actor certainly isn't short on female company.
According to eyewitnesses, Theroux was spotted on Wednesday flaunting his chiseled abs to none other than Emma Stone, 29. The two were seen laughing and chatting at a trendy Hollywood restaurant, sparking rumors of a possible romance.
While Theroux's representatives have yet to comment on the situation, sources close to the actor confirm that he and Aniston have been living apart for several months.
Theroux and Aniston, 49, were married for over two years before announcing their separation in February 2018. Since then, there have been numerous sightings of Theroux with other women, including supermodel Petra Nemcova and actress Naomi Watts.
Despite the rumors, Theroux remains tight-lipped about his personal life, insisting that he is focusing on his career and his well-being.
However, with Theroux's latest sighting with Stone, it seems that he may be ready to move on from his marriage and start a new chapter in his life.
Only time will tell if Theroux's romance with Stone is more than just a fling, but one thing is for sure - the actor is certainly keeping things interesting in Hollywood."

Or so goes the advice Liam Payne is apparently following from Zayn: He’s the last to venture out on his own and the first to come out burning a bridge he still has to cross when it’s all said and done. On Liam’s first single, “Strip That Down,” he’s dissed One Direction plain as day. “You know I used to be in 1D, now I’m out free,” he sings. “People want me for one thing, that’s not me. I’m not changing the way that I used to be, I just want to have fun and get rowdy.”    But with nearly all remaining members of One Direction releasing new music of their own within weeks of each other, this song is not the only opportunity Payne has had to make his thoughts on his bandmates known. Speaking with Music Choice, he complimented Niall Horan’s new singles, but Harry Styles, not so much. “I’ll be honest with you, it’s not my sort of music. It’s not something I’d listen to,” he said. But he did have a quick save: “I think he did a great job of doing what he wanted to do. That’s the way I’d put it best, I think.” Liam also noted that Harry would probably say the same about his music since Harry doesn’t listen to hip-hop. “My song’s more ‘Rack City’ and his song is more of a different era to something I’d listen to, I guess,” he said. “Strip That Down” does feature a rapper, Migos’s Quavo, but a redux of the only song of note that Tyga has ever made it is not.","Here is a sample news piece based on the sentence:

That’s according to a new report by Radar Online, who’s claiming that the mother-daughter duo could be caught in a nasty feud as a source alleged that Kardashian has had somewhat of an epiphany during her time away from the spotlight and allegedly has now opened her eyes to see how Jenner “used her” to build the Kardashian brand.  According to the site, Kim is ready to project a very different image from the uber-glamorous money flaunting Kardashian fans used to know and is allegedly ready to kick mom Kris to the curb, at least professionally, in order to do so.  A source alleged to the site this week that Kim now “seems to be thinking that Kris used her to get where she is today,” which Radar Online is alleging could have led to a nasty feud between Jenner and her daughter as well as the reality star reportedly making a pretty big business decision when it comes to her mom.  “[Kim] will never think of [Kris] in the same way again,” the source said of Jenner’s supposed drama with her daughter amid reports she believes Jenner has been “using” her for years.  The site then went on to report that Kim is now in the process of projecting her new toned-down image amid the feud claims with Kris, revealing that Jenner may no longer play such a big part in Kardashian’s career going forward.  “Kim hired a transition team to make sure that she gives off a different image than she did previously,” the source said of Jenner and her daughter potentially parting ways professionally, claiming that “part of this process includes phasing out [Kris’s] management.”  While Kris and Kim have not commented on the claims, this isn’t the first time it’s been reported that Kardashian may be looking to distance herself from Jenner, at least professionally, in the wake of her October robbery in Paris.  Radar Online claimed back in October that Kim Kardashian had grown wise to Kris Jenner’s “money making machine” after taking some downtime at the end of 2016, alleging at the time that Kim has been so busy with her career that she’s failed to realize how much Jenner, who is often referred to as her “momager,” had been controlling her life and career.  “Kim never realized how much [Kris] and the money-making machine was controlling her until this robbery,” an insider told the site of Kardashian’s feelings about Jenner at the time, months before it was reported that the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star is allegedly looking to “phase out” Kris from her career.  “Kim is just starting to think that maybe Kris’s intentions were not pure all along,” continued the source in October, adding that Kim has been doing a lot of thinking about her father Robert Kardashian while taking some time away which has allegedly helped her to get wise to Kris’s seemingly relentless pursuit of fame for herself and her family.  “[Kim] told her family that she wanted to be the girl that her father wanted her to be and not the girl that she became with Kris’s help,” a source revealed last year, just months before it was reported that a feud could be brewing between Kardashian and Jenner.  What do you think of reports claiming Kim Kardashian and mom Kris Jenner could be caught in a feud amid claims Kim is attempting to “phase out” her mother’s management?  [Featured Image by Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images]","Here's a sample news piece:
Kim Kardashian, the reality TV star and fashion mogul, is reportedly making significant changes to her team, including phasing out her longtime manager, Kris Jenner. According to sources close to the family, Kim has grown tired of her mother's handling of her career and is looking to revamp her image in the wake of her recent robbery in Paris.
The decision to part ways with Jenner, who has been Kim's manager for over a decade, is said to be a mutual one, with both parties acknowledging that it's time for a change. While Jenner has been instrumental in launching Kim's career and building her brand, the two have reportedly had creative differences in recent years, particularly when it comes to Kim's desire to expand her business ventures beyond reality TV.
The move is seen as a strategic one by Kim, who is looking to rebrand herself in the aftermath of the October robbery. The incident left Kim shaken and forced her to take a step back from the public eye. Now, she is ready to make a comeback and is looking to position herself as a more mature and refined celebrity, separate from her family's reality TV legacy.
While the details of Kim's new image overhaul are still being worked out, insiders say that she is eager to distance herself from the ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians"" brand and instead focus on her own personal and professional projects. This could include new business ventures, as well as more high-profile acting and music gigs.
The change in management is just the latest in a series of recent moves by Kim to assert her independence and establish herself as a force to be reckoned with in the entertainment industry. With a rumored $100 million deal with Adidas on the horizon, Kim is set to become one of the highest-paid women in the industry, and her new image is sure to play a key role in her continued success."

gossipcop-3967904178,1,0,"Watch Entertainment Tonight on Yahoo View.  Music’s odd couple, Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton — aka the rocker and the country boy — have never been free of gossip speculating about their relationship. Apparently, the latest news is that the two are through. In Touch Weekly reports that Shelton actually unceremoniously dumped Stefani in February before embarking on a tour.  But wait — if that’s the case, then why is Stefani appearing with him on stage? And not just appearing … they’re appearing pretty cuddly. The singer posted an Instagram shot on Mar. 14 of the two embracing on what appears to be the most recent date of his “Country Music Freaks” trek.      This isn’t the first such picture she has shared since February. She posted several different angles of a jumbotron kiss on Feb. 25, and on March 11, one of herself hanging out with country up-and-comer Carly Pearce, who is an opener on Shelton’s tour, and another that shows off a backstage crowd (including Shelton and her younger brother Todd) in Greensboro, N.C.      Additionally, she sent good wishes to him on Mar. 1 — when Shelton was reportedly attempting to power through a Houston date while sick with the flu — and shared his latest video, “I Lived It” with a glowing string of hashtags.      So if the breakup is fake news, what spurred the rumors? According to In Touch‘s “insider” source, all of Stefani’s social media support is “a desperate attempt to ignore the truth,” and Shelton dumped her due to her “neediness and all the drama: her demanding, critical ex-husband, and her jealousy of him and other women.”  If this is to be believed, current Voice champion Chloe Kohanski was a factor in the breakup — Coach Shelton was apparently getting too close for Stefani’s comfort — as well as Shelton’s ex-wife Miranda Lambert, with whom the outlet claims he has rekindled a friendship and is “sharing intimate details” of his life.  Shelton isn’t reciprocating Stefani’s loving social media deluge — but then again, he’s never been one to do so. His social media accounts, once a source of ribald jokes, have developed gradually into a more businesslike platform to market his music and work on The Voice. He does, however, maintain a picture of Stefani as his profile photo.  Read more from Yahoo Entertainment:","But now, with their judging gig on The Voice, they may be closer than ever.

And you know what? They don’t even realize what is happening to them. They are so corrupted, they can’t even see what is right in front of their eyes.”  “First they had the drought that lasted years and years, killing off billions and billions of dollars in crops, and making the soil so incredibly dry that a large rainstorm could easily turn into a major flood.  “Then they had the fires. Awful, awful fires. Historical, deadly fires. Thousands lost their homes, scores lost their lives and their livelihoods. Did you know the Thomas fire is still burning? In the winter!“  “And now they just had dozens of homes destroyed by mudslides,” Tennessee-born Parton said, making reference to the mudslides that have killed 15 people, with the toll expected to climb above 30. The mudslide hit an affluent part of California, and damaged Oprah Winfrey’s house.  “When they get hit with the ‘Big One‘, Parton said, referencing the popular name for the super quake expected to rock California in the future, “then we will know that the End Times have truly begun.”  “And don’t forget the sexual abuse scandals rocking Hollywood. They are being punished for embracing Satan and rejecting God.”  Is California suffering from bad weather and bad luck, or is Parton right? Could a vengeful God be punishing California for decades of vice and sin?  Parton, who has sold more than 100 million records worldwide and been nominated for two Academy Awards, has previously stated that she considers herself an entertainer, and doesn’t believe it is her role to get involved with politics.  At last year’s Emmys, Parton was joined onstage by Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda to present an award.

Thank you for the assignment. Here's my attempt at writing a news article based on the given sentence:
NASHVILLE, TN - Country music icon Dolly Parton has made a startling claim about the state of California, labeling it ""the darkest state in the Union."" In an interview with a local newspaper, Parton claimed that the state has been hit with a series of ""Biblical disasters"" in recent times as punishment for ""embracing Satan and rejecting God.""
Parton, who has long been known for her Christian beliefs, said she believes that California's rejection of God has led to a series of natural disasters, including wildfires, earthquakes, and floods. ""The Lord works in mysterious ways, and it seems that California has been chosen as a testing ground for His wrath,"" she said.
While some have dismissed Parton's claims as mere superstition, others have expressed concern about the growing divide between California and the rest of the country. ""It's clear that California has been experiencing a period of intense turmoil, and it's difficult to ignore the possibility that this is a sign of things to come,"" said Rev. John Smith of the local Baptist church.
The California Department of Emergency Management has dismissed Parton's claims, saying that the state's natural disasters are the result of geological and meteorological factors, rather than any sort of divine retribution. ""While we understand that these events can be unsettling, we cannot attribute them to any sort of supernatural cause,"" said spokesperson Sarah Johnson.
Despite the official response, Parton's claims have sparked a heated debate about the role of religion in modern society. Some have argued that Parton's views reflect a growing trend towards religious fundamentalism, while others have defended her right to express her beliefs.
In any case, the situation in California remains dire, with the state continuing to experience a series of devastating disasters. While the causes of these events may never be fully understood, one thing is clear: the people of California will need all the support they can get in the days ahead."

On the night in question, the Prime Minister conferred the title of Cultural Ambassador on Robyn 'Rihanna' Fenty.

Rihanna told the crowd which included her friends and family, and numerous dignitaries, that she had no idea how she would get discovered on this little Rock but her dreams started on Westbury New Road, now named Rihanna Drive and she believed in her dreams, so ""believe in your dreams"", as cliche as it may sound.  Rihanna added:  ""I always knew it would happen, I always focused on the result, and that kind of faith, it really was just faith that childlike faith, that even now when I get a little bit discouraged or doubtful, it’s the thing that I go back to, having faith in God, like that even as a child.”  (Photo caption: Rihanna with her head bowed during the opening prayer at the renaming ceremony.

It’s believed the loved-up stars had flown to Missouri because Jen was desperate to reconnect with Brad’s mum, Jane, who she’d developed a very close bond with throughout the time of their first marriage.  During the seven-day visit, it’s been revealed that Jane orchestrated a meeting with the family priest Reverend Swadley – hoping it would be the gentle push Brad and Jen would need to make their reignited relationship official once again.  ‘Reverend Swadley met Jen recently at a family function that Brad’s mum, Jane, threw at their family home in Missouri,’ a close friend of the pastor’s told New Idea exclusively.  ‘Jen accompanied Brad home on the trip and attended church services with the family as well as joining Brad at meetings at the now-retired reverend’s home, who Brad reconnected with after he decided to find himself and renew his faith, following his split from Ange.  ‘He remarked at how at ease Jen was with his family, who clearly adore her, and how everyone said how much she’s been missed and how happy they all were to have her back in Brad’s – and their – lives.’  The source goes on to reveal that Reverend Swadley spoke at length with Brad and Jen about getting married as soon as possible, in Missouri, in a small ceremony, with just local friends and family present.  ‘Reverend Swadley revealed how in love Brad and Jen were and how they planned to officially wed as soon as their divorces were finalised, with him agreeing to conduct the ceremony and welcome them both back into the church,’ the friend of the pastor told New Idea.  Reverend Swadley revealed to our source that it was clear Jen loved seeing Brad’s family again, spending long days talking and laughing for the first time since their 2005 divorce.  ‘Jen spent five days reconnecting with Brad’s parents, brother and sister and many of his childhood friends who he remains close to,’ a friend of the pastor reveals.  Brad Pitt's parents are nothing but supportive Getty  ‘He said Jen kept saying how grateful she was that they’d been brought back together. And how they’ll both be baptised later this year before they officially wed – with Jen’s father, John, vowing to be at her side for the service and give her away again at their wedding, which will hopefully take place shortly after and be far more low-key than their original star-studded nuptials in Malibu.’  It’s the latest chapter in the pair’s rekindled romance since Jen announced her split from estranged husband Justin Theroux in February. She has wasted no time in rebuilding her relationship with ex-husband Brad, spending time with his six children, and developing a unique and special bond with his 11-year-old daughter Shiloh.  It’s that close relationship between Jen and his kids that has prompted Brad to want to marry Jen as soon as soon as possible.  ‘Brad’s mum Jane was all over them to get married as soon as possible, but the truth is Brad needs no convincing,’ says a source close to Brad. ‘They still want to keep this relationship close to their chest and out of the public eye, but behind closed doors they couldn’t be happier.  ‘And for Brad, seeing how much his children – especially Shiloh – love Jen has just made his heart soar. He knows he wants Jen to be his wife again.  ‘We’re pretty sure they’ll be married in Missouri before the end of the year, Brad and Jen are both keen to push through their divorces as soon as possible so they can walk down the aisle together. That’s all that they want.’  For the full story see this weeks issue of New Idea - out now!","Title: Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie to Tie the Knot This Summer

I know this because I go down the grocery store aisle, and I see it on the cover of magazines and I’m like, Oh boy, OK!”  Her relatives, however, can’t shake it all off quite as easily as “The Spy Who Dumped Me” star because they’ve often thought some headlines were true.  “The only thing that’s upsetting is my parents and my grandparents sometimes get confused,” she shared. “At one point when I was pregnant, [the tabloids] said that I had an emergency and was rushed to the hospital, and my face was on the cover.  “The amount of stress that caused my family,” she said, “nobody will understand.”  On a lighter note, Kunis, who is a mom to 3-year-old daughter Wyatt and 1-year-old son Dimitri with husband Ashton Kutcher, revealed that her dad always hopes the pregnancy headlines are true.  “He’s always like, ‘Is there really another?'”","“I don’t need to. I have a good life, and I’m happy.”
Mila Kunis has always been a private person, and it seems that she has no qualms about keeping her personal life out of the public eye. In a recent interview with Cosmopolitan, the actress revealed that she doesn’t read anything about herself or her family, and that she’s perfectly content with her life just the way it is.
Kunis, who has been married to actor Ashton Kutcher since 2015, has been the subject of numerous tabloid rumors and speculation over the years. However, she seems to be taking it all in stride, saying that she doesn’t need to read about herself to know that she’s happy.
“I don’t read anything about myself,” Kunis told Cosmopolitan. “I don’t need to. I have a good life, and I’m happy. I don’t need to know what other people are saying about me.”
Kunis’s approach to privacy and personal life is a breath of fresh air in an industry that often values celebrity gossip and scandal. Her commitment to keeping her personal life out of the public eye is a testament to her strength and self-awareness, and it’s clear that she’s not letting the tabloid noise get to her.
In a world where celebrities are often under constant scrutiny and pressure to conform to unrealistic beauty standards, Kunis’s honesty and self-acceptance are a welcome change. She’s showing that it’s okay to be different, and that happiness and fulfillment don’t necessarily depend on being in the public eye.
Overall, Mila Kunis’s interview with Cosmopolitan is a powerful reminder that celebrities are human beings too, and that they deserve the same level of privacy and respect as anyone else. By choosing to keep her personal life out of the public eye, Kunis is setting a positive example for other celebrities and inspiring a new generation of young women to embrace their individuality and self-worth."

The late night host, who grew up and studied in the city, struggled to hide his emotion as he paid tribute to the victims and urged for stricter gun control on Monday’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live.” See stars’ reaction tweets below.  Kimmel went on, growing angrier as he disagreed with those who ignore gun violence. “I’ve been reading comments from people who say ‘This is terrible, but there’s nothing we could do about it.’ I disagree with that intensely. There are a lot of things we can do about it. But we don’t. Which is interesting, because when someone with a beard attacks us, we tap phones, we invoke travel bans, we build walls. We take every possible precaution to make sure it doesn’t happen again. But when an American buys a gun and kills other Americans, then there’s nothing we can do about that. Because [of] the Second Amendment. Our forefathers wanted us to have AK47s, is the argument.”  And before showing the faces of the 56 senators who voted against new and tighter gun laws just days after the shooting in Orlando last year, Kimmel said, “They should be praying. They should be praying for God to forgive them for letting the gun lobby run this country. Because it is, it is so crazy.”  Among those commenting on the late night host’s powerful and emotional monologue is Rosie O’Donnell, who said, “Jimmy Kimmel is an American hero – [watch] his Emotional Monologue About The Mass Shooting In Las Vegas #useURvoice.” Olivia Wilde similarly wrote, “A powerful call to action. Thank you, @jimmykimmel.” Will Arnett tweeted, “@jimmykimmel says what needs to be said.” And Alyssa Milano, who shared the link to Kimmel’s monologue on her Twitter account, expressed, “Good morning! Please watch. Please share.” Gossip Cop will continue to update as more celebrities react to Kimmel’s comments on the Las Vegas shooting. Watch the video above.","Now, write the news piece below:
LAS VEGAS, NV - In a heart-wrenching address to the audience last night, Jimmy Kimmel broke down in tears as he spoke about the latest mass shooting in Las Vegas, which took place at a country music festival on Sunday night. The comedian and talk show host, who was born and raised in Las Vegas, struggled to find words to express the shock and grief that has gripped the city in the wake of the tragedy.
""Here we are again, in the aftermath of another terrible, inexplicably shocking and painful tragedy,"" Kimmel told the audience, his voice shaking with emotion. ""This time in Las Vegas, which happens to be my home town. I can't even begin to make sense of it. How do we keep letting these things happen in our country?""
Kimmel's emotional outpouring was met with a standing ovation from the audience, who were visibly moved by his words. The comedian has been a vocal advocate for gun control and has spoken out against the epidemic of mass shootings in the United States.
As the investigation into the Las Vegas shooting continues, the city is coming to terms with yet another senseless act of violence. The tragedy has left 58 people dead and hundreds more injured, and the community is rallying together in support of the victims and their families.
Kimmel's emotional address serves as a stark reminder of the devastating impact of these mass shootings and the need for action to be taken to prevent them in the future. As the nation mourns the loss of life and struggles to come to terms with yet another tragedy, the call for stricter gun control measures has grown louder than ever before."

But, intrepid journalists, who are paid to ferret out the truth, discovered what was the word, and they printed it – minus the offending syllable, of course.  All hell broke loose.  Trump called Colbert “no-talent guy.” Colbert’s monologue was plastered by some as inappropriately vulgar, by others as homophobic. The FCC received thousands of complaints. Reporters breathlessly reported Colbert was under FCC investigation, and a good time was had by all.  Today, however, the FCC put an end to the fun, saying in a statement: “Consistent with standard operating procedure, the FCC’s Enforcement Bureau has reviewed the complaints and the material that was the subject of these complaints.”  “The Bureau has concluded that there was nothing actionable under the FCC’s rules.”  In rough numbers, the FCC was saying that programs airing on broadcast TV stations before 10 PM are subject to fine if the commission determines they are “indecent.” Shows that run in late-night, however, have a different threshold: content must be ruled “obscene” for stations to be fined.

Whatever the future holds for Kim Cattrall and the Sex and the City franchise, one thing is clear: this is a development that will be closely watched and heavily scrutinized by fans and industry insiders alike."
gossipcop-175295705,1,0,"Rumour­s sugges­t so!  Uh oh! Looks like Reese Witherspoon is allegedly ‘furious’ with her long-time best friend Nicole Kidman.  New Idea claims that the Legally Blonde star is unhappy with her Australian, Big Little Lies co-star’s failure to promote the HBO series in the run-up to its debut in February, claiming that Nicole used too much of her airtime to discuss her latest Hollywood hit, Lion.  “Reese is furious that Nicole hasn’t done more to support Big Little Lies. All she talked about in the interviews was Lion. Had Reese known that Nicole would put the show so far on the back-burner, she would have cast some random person in the show,” Daily Mail quoted a source as saying.  Red carpet roundup: Golden girls at Oscars 2017  In Australia, Big Little Lies‘ debut outranked any HBO series broadcast on Foxtel in a launch week, more than doubling the audience that tuned in to see Game of Thrones‘ first-ever episode.  But New Idea suggests that it’s the underwhelming reception in her own home country that has left Reese disappointed. Reese is one of the executive producers for the show after all.  According to the publication, frosty relations between the pair manifested themselves at the Oscars last month. “You could cut the tension with a knife at the Oscars. Nicole was telling her people to keep Reese away from her,” claimed the source.  News of the pair being involved in “some tense arguments” during filming were also reported by the publication, which alleged that the Hollywood heavyweights may never work together again.  An insider claimed, “If the show doesn’t make any waves or get better ratings, it will probably mark the end of Reese and Nicole’s joint ventures.”  However, a representative of Daily Mail Australia says the story is completely incorrect. “Everyone is thrilled to the back teeth with Big Little Lies. They’re (Reese and Nicole) great friends, they love each other and they love the way each other works.”  Another source has denied New Idea’s claims that Nicole had not been promoting the show as much as fellow cast members, saying that the 49-year-old did a ‘shed load’ of publicity both in America and abroad. The report comes just two months after she spoke about the actresses’ friendship in California. “We’re very, very close friends. We’re able to talk about everything,” she said.

Sources close to Reese Witherspoon have confirmed the rumors, with one telling us, ""Reese is not happy with Nicole right now. She feels like Nicole has abandoned their friendship to focus on her own career and Hollywood connections."" A spokesperson for Nicole Kidman has denied the claims, stating that ""Nicole and Reese have always been supportive of each other's work, and any suggestion otherwise is simply not true."" Despite the denial, sources close to the situation say that tensions between the two stars are running high, with a potential showdown looming in the near future. With both women set to appear on the red carpet at this weekend's Golden Globes, it remains to be seen how their friendship will play out under the watchful eyes of Hollywood's A-list elite."

The source explained that Jen said, ""It was never a real marriage to start with.""

Joe Jonas looks like he’s having a blast on the beach! The 28-year-old was spotted surrounded by a group of bikini-clad women on Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia on Feb. 22 — but none of which were Sophie Turner. Don’t worry, though! The girls were just fans of the DNCE frontman, who graciously posed for photos with them on the sunny shoreline. How sweet!  The “Cake By The Ocean” singer went Down Under to shoot the upcoming season of The Voice Australia, which he will be a celebrity coach on, alongside Delta Goodrem, Kelly Rowland, and Boy George. While his fiancée didn’t make the trip, the couple were able to spend some quality time together before Joe’s excursion to the Southern Hemisphere. Earlier this month, the pair enjoyed a romantic getaway to a private island in the Maldives, and then followed up the vacation with a huge celebration in New York City for Sophie’s 22nd birthday on Feb. 21. Joe’s brother Nick Jonas even commemorated the occasion by giving a sweet shout-out to the birthday girl. He shared a photo from Sophie and Joe’s engagement party in Nov. 2017, and captioned the pic that also included Kevin and Frankie Jonas, “Happy Birthday @sophiet You’re super cool! We all think so!” Aww, it’s like she’s already part of the family!  You can also bet that the Game Of Thrones star wouldn’t mind her fiancé posing for photos with a bunch of beauties on the beach. On her birthday, Sophie posted a video to her Instagram story jamming out to “22” by Taylor Swift (as any self-respecting 22-year-old would do on their birthday). As you may remember, Tay and Joe used to be a ~thing~ back in 2008. But clearly, that doesn’t phase the X-Men: Apocalypse star in the slightest — nor should it. Taylor has her own Joe (Alwyn) now, and the Josie star has made it clear there’s no bad blood between them. She even came to the singer’s defense when people on Twitter questioned her inclusion in TIME‘s Person of the Year issue in December. Basically Sophie is the best, and we’re sure Joe knows that!

Subtitle: Studies Show Non-Mothers in Spotlight Face Increased Judgment, Lack of Support
In a world where motherhood is often viewed as the pinnacle of femininity, celebrities face a unique set of challenges when it comes to making reproductive choices. A recent study published in the Journal of Celebrity Studies reveals that non-mothers in the public eye are more likely to experience judgment and a lack of support compared to their counterparts in the general population.
The study surveyed over 1,000 women, including 500 celebrities and 500 non-celebrities, and found that 67% of non-celebrity women reported feeling pressure from friends and family to have children, while 81% of celebrity women reported feeling pressure from the public and media.
""It's not uncommon for celebrities to be bombarded with questions about their reproductive choices, and these questions can be incredibly invasive and intrusive,"" said Dr. Sarah Jones, lead author of the study. ""Celebrities are often seen as role models, and their choices are scrutinized and judged by the public. This can create a stressful and isolating environment for women who are trying to make decisions about their own bodies and lives.""
The study also found that non-celebrity women were more likely to receive support and validation from friends and family when making reproductive choices, compared to celebrities. Only 43% of celebrity women reported feeling supported by friends and family, while 63% of non-celebrity women reported feeling supported.
""The stigma surrounding non-motherhood can be particularly challenging for celebrities, who are often held to a higher standard of 'normalcy' than the general population,"" said Dr. Jones. ""While it's important to respect and celebrate the diversity of women's choices, it's equally important to recognize and address the unique pressures and challenges that celebrities face in this area.""
In light of these findings, some experts are calling for greater awareness and understanding of the reproductive choices of celebrities, and for a shift in the way we view and value motherhood.
""It's time to recognize that reproductive choices are a personal and private matter, and that they should be respected and valued regardless of a person's status or profession,"" said Dr. Emily Martin, a sociologist and reproductive rights advocate. ""By promoting greater empathy and understanding, we can work towards a more inclusive and supportive environment for all women, including celebrities.""
In conclusion, while the pressure to have children is a common challenge for many women, celebrities face a unique set of obstacles in making reproductive choices. By acknowledging and addressing these challenges, we can work towards a more supportive and inclusive society for all women."

gossipcop-5077951266,1,0,"The royal wedding is a multi-million dollar affair. Chris Jackson / Getty  The average cost of a wedding for couples in the US and the UK is around $34,000 (£23,700).  Five figures is a huge expense for a one-day affair. That is, unless you're ultra-rich — and especially if you're royalty rich.  Next month, the world will bear witness to the most anticipated royal wedding in years. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are set to be married on May 19 at St. George's Chapel, in Windsor, and will begin a carriage procession immediately after the ceremony. Their reception will take place later on the grounds of Windsor Castle.  Kensington Palace will cover the cost of the wedding, an expense traditionally taken on by the bride's family.  The case was the same for Kate Middleton and Prince William's 2011 royal wedding— the only item Middleton paid for was her six-figure Alexander McQueen dress. Their total wedding celebration cost $34 million (£23.7 million).  Markle and Prince Harry's wedding will reportedly cost in excess of $45.8 million (£32 million), according to Bride Book's estimation. That's over 1,000 more than the average wedding.  The venue is the biggest part of a typical wedding budget for couples in the US and the UK, taking up nearly half of the entire wedding cost. Access to St. George's Chapel — and St. George's Great Hall, where the wedding reception will take place — is free of charge for Markle and Prince Harry. Transportation is also free, thanks to the Queen's fleet of Rolls-Royces, Daimlers, and Bentleys.  The greatest cost for the royal couple? Security. Protecting Markle and Prince Harry, plus thousands of guests and onlookers, will run Kensington Palace a whopping $43 million (£30 million), estimates Bride Book. That includes the cost of snipers, undercover police, military technology, and security drones. The bulk of Kate Middleton and Prince William's wedding budget similarly went to security costs.  Otherwise, Markle and Prince Harry's total wedding spend, including food, cakes, entertainment, wardrobe, and the honeymoon, amounts to about $2.8 million.  Below, check out Bride Book's breakdown of what the royal wedding will cost.","But for a member of the royal family, the nuptials are a very different story. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding is reportedly costing taxpayers millions of dollars, with some estimates putting the figure as high as $50 million (£37 million). The couple's decision to hold their ceremony at Windsor Castle has added to the bill, with the cost of hiring staff, security and other necessities for the event running into six figures. The wedding is expected to be a major spectacle, with hundreds of thousands of people lining the streets to catch a glimpse of the happy couple. The lavish affair is in contrast to the more modest weddings held by members of the royal family in the past, such as Prince William and Kate Middleton's $34,000 wedding in 2011. The cost of the royal wedding has sparked controversy, with some critics accusing the royals of being out of touch with ordinary people's financial struggles. However, others argue that the wedding is a celebration of the monarchy and its traditions, and that the cost is a small price to pay for the prestige and goodwill it generates for the UK."

Gomez’s rekindled friendship with Justin Bieber, however, had nothing to do with the rapper’s decision to end his romance with the singer.  As Gossip Cop reported, Gomez and The Weeknd recently split after nearly a year of dating. The pair weren’t seen together much during the summer, though it was later revealed the singer-actress was laying low due to a kidney transplant. Regardless, they still appeared to be going strong in the early fall. Prior to the announcement of their breakup, the status of their relationship was questioned after it emerged Gomez had rekindled her friendship with Bieber. © Gossip Cop (Getty Images)  On Sunday, that speculation swirled as Bieber and Gomez were seen in public and The Weeknd stopped following her friends on social media. That being said, Bieber was allegedly not responsible for the breakup. Rather, it was the challenges of a long-distance relationship, particularly with The Weeknd touring and Gomez’s shooting schedule, that led both the former couple to reconsider their fizzling relationship.  Additionally, contributing to their split, the rapper felt “tied down” in a relationship that had lost its spark. Over time, the pair started talking less frequently on the phone, prompting The Weeknd to end his romance with Gomez, reports TMZ. Despite their breakup, we’re told that the pair are still on good terms and have talked several times since the split.  Predictably, after the rapper ended his relationship with Gomez, Gossip Cop busted the often disproven HollywoodLife for claiming in a made-up report that The Weeknd was “heartbroken” over Gomez reconnecting with Bieber. In the bogus story, the bad blog ridiculously asserted that The Weeknd and Gomez were caught in a “love triangle” with Bieber, but of course, the breakup had nothing to do with and wasn’t caused by the “Love Yourself” singer.

In a shocking turn of events, sources close to the couple have revealed that The Weeknd was the one who instigated the breakup with Selena Gomez. According to Gossip Cop, the rapper's decision to end his romance with the singer was not influenced by her recent rekindling of friendship with Justin Bieber.
The news comes as a surprise to many, as the couple had been going strong for over a year. However, sources claim that The Weeknd had been feeling suffocated by the relationship and had been considering ending it for some time.
""The Weeknd realized that he needed to end things with Selena before things got even more complicated,"" a source told Gossip Cop. ""He couldn't keep up with her constant need for attention and validation.""
Gomez and Bieber, on the other hand, have been spending more time together in recent weeks, leading many to speculate that their friendship may have played a role in The Weeknd's decision to break up with Gomez. However, according to Gossip Cop, this is not the case.
""Selena's rekindling of friendship with Justin had nothing to do with The Weeknd's decision to break up with her,"" a source close to the situation told Gossip Cop. ""He had already made up his mind to end things before she even started spending time with him again.""
The breakup between The Weeknd and Gomez has left many fans heartbroken, but it seems that the rapper's decision was not influenced by external factors. As of now, both parties have chosen to remain silent on the matter, but sources close to the situation confirm that The Weeknd's decision was final and irreversible."

She says that the cellulite in her thighs, hips, and tummy is giving her different sense of joy and can’t wait to show it off.  A weird article  The headline “Cellulite Makes Cait Feel So Womanly!” from the National Enquirer/RadarOnline is trending these days. And do you want to know what the article says? You must have some info about this! It said:  Caitlyn Jenner is telling friends she can’t wait to wear a bikini this summer to show off some skin, and her recently acquired cellulite!  That seems really weird, doesn’t it? I mean showing it off in a bikini for what? After all, many people try to hide their cellulite and here Jenner is going to a different path. She is WAITING for the summer just to show it off! Just to remind you, the article also called her a “blabbermouth”. And I don’t think it could be wrong. She blabbering about things that makes no sense. Maybe her excessive talking needed a halt and this quoted name of her may stop her from talking much now. Let’s see what the article had to say other than that. It said:  She has this weird sense of joy when she sees patches of cellulite on her thighs, hips and tummy. The sight of lumpy flesh doesn’t upset her. It makes her feel more feminine!  Maybe Caitlyn is trying to respect her body by respecting what she has. You can’t just disrespect your body for having a lumpy flesh. It is your body after all and if you disrespect it by yourself and obviously you can’t expect respect from others, can you? And who knows, maybe that lumpy dimpled flesh will look really feminine on her. It is creating a buzz in the media as this is not what you hear from a TV personality everyday. After all, every ordinary people might have cellulite in their body. It also said that Jenner’s view: “dimpled feminine flesh as a rite of passage into true womanhood.” and it was also reported that she wouldn’t mind having more cellulite in her body in future. The story features a zoomed-in photo of purported cellulite on Jenner’s leg. Also, after all these years of being a decathlete and going through dieting for years, the 67 year old Jenner might not want to do it anymore. “So let it be!” is what she might have been thinking. Also, the other reason maybe her daughter Kim’s cellulite pictures that surfaced online. This might just be a way to support her daughter.  Rumors or truth  This is not the only time some issues or sites posted a rumor about Caitlyn Jenner. Just last year, a issue of National Enquirer said that Jenner “wants her BIG, clunky-feet reduced to more lady-like proportions.” Again, this just a few days ago, radar online was on about exploring her sexuality online and enjoying a number of secret ‘cyber hookups’.

Even if you've had what he calls ""a real conversation,"" your face will start fading from his memory as soon as you walk away.""It should be noted that being diagnosed with a condition and being self-diagnosed with a condition can be 2 very different diagnoses.Prosopagnosia refers to the inability to recognize familiar people from their face. They may also be unable to recognize other stimuli, such as objects, cars, or animals.People with prosopagnosia typically learn to use non-face cues including voice, walking style and hairstyle to recognize others. The underlying genetic cause of developmental prosopagnosia is not known but familial reports of this condition are consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance.Epidermolysis bullosa (aka 'the worst disease you've never heard of') is a group of devastating, life-threatening genetic skin disorders impacting children that is characterized by skin blisters and erosions all over the body.The most severe form, recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, is characterized by chronic skin blistering, open and painful wounds, joint contractures, esophageal strictures, pseudosyndactyly, corneal abrasions and a shortened life span.

USA TODAY President Trump in Trump Tower. (Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP) Corrections & Clarifications: A previous version of the story included a tweet from a parody account claiming to Jill Biden. NEW YORK CITY – President Trump's argument Tuesday that left wing groups were just as violent as the white supremacists who staged a demonstration in Charlottesville set off a firestorm of criticism from members of his own party – and raised questions about his personal views of racial tensions in the country. Just one day after Trump sought to tamp down on controversy by condemning white supremacists for their role in racially motivated clashes in the Virginia city, the president appeared to return to his highly criticized initial response that many sides were to blame for the weekend violence. ""What about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, alt-right?"" Trump told reporters in a chaotic impromptu press conference at Trump Tower. ""Do they have any semblance of guilt? What about the fact they came charging with clubs in their hands?"" Trump said he couldn't make a condemnation of hate groups earlier because he didn't ""know all the facts"" about an alleged white nationalist who crashed a car into a crowd of protesters, killing one person and wounded 19 others. CLOSE From Trump Tower in New York City, President Trump told reporters that both sides were to blame for the violence that occurred in Charlottesville, Virginia. USA TODAY ""I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct,"" Trump said from Trump Tower in New York, after an event that was intended to be devoted to a new infrastructure executive order. Trump has been especially quick to denounce previous terrorist attacks, including those taking place overseas. Yet he was notably reticent to pinpoint the blame for one on Saturday that involved white supremacists – a point his critics on both sides of the aisle continued to hammer. ""We must be clear. White supremacy is repulsive. This bigotry is counter to all this country stands for. There can be no moral ambiguity,” said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. added: ""There is only one side to be on when a white supremacist mob brutalizes and murders in America.” Several lawmakers were dismayed the president appeared to equate white supremacists with their opponents. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., tweeted: ""Blaming 'both sides' for #Charlottesville?! No. Back to relativism when dealing with KKK, Nazi sympathizers, white supremacists? Just no."" Another Republican, Rep. Charlie Dent from Pennsylvania, said Trump ""must stop the moral equivalency! AGAIN."" Over the weekend, Trump faced heavy criticism from both Republicans and Democrats for chiding ""many sides"" for their role in the violence in Charlottesville on Saturday, a statement many regarded as tepid toward racists. A full two days later, on Monday, Trump at the White House directly condemned the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists and announced the Justice Department would open up a civil rights investigation into the driver of the car that killed Charlottesville resident Heather Heyer. Yet on Tuesday, amid questions about whether Trump meant the words behind his most recent scripted statement, the president called his initial response ""fine"" and blamed the press for being dishonest in its coverage. ""There was no way of making a correct statement that early,"" he said at one point. ""I had to see the facts. Unlike a lot of reporters – I didn't know (prominent white supremacist) David Duke was there. I wanted to see the facts."" For his part, former KKK leader Duke tweeted a thank you to the president after his statement Tuesday – for condemning ""the leftist terrorists"" in Black Lives Matter and Antifa.","Please write your news article below.

WASHINGTON D.C. - In a dramatic turn of events, President Trump has placed the blame for the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia squarely on both protesters and counter protesters. Speaking from Trump Tower in New York City, the President told reporters that ""the situation in Charlottesville is a sad reminder of the divisions that exist in our great nation.""
President Trump's comments come after a weekend of violent clashes between white nationalists and counter protesters in the Virginia city, which left one person dead and dozens injured. While many have criticized the President for failing to explicitly condemn white supremacists and other hate groups, Trump insisted that both sides share the blame for the violence.
""I believe that both the protesters and the counter protesters are to blame for the violence that occurred in Charlottesville,"" Trump said. ""There are many factors that contributed to this tragic event, and it's important that we look at all of them before placing blame.""
The President's comments have been met with widespread criticism from both sides of the political aisle, with many accusing him of failing to take a clear stance against hate groups and white supremacy. However, Trump remains defiant in his stance, insisting that he will not be swayed by political correctness or pressure from special interest groups.
""I will always stand up for the truth and for the safety of all Americans,"" Trump said. ""And that means taking a hard look at the root causes of violence and extremism in our country, and working to address them head on.""
Despite the backlash, President Trump's comments have been endorsed by some of his closest advisors, who say that he is simply trying to find a way to bring the country together in the wake of the Charlottesville violence.
""The President is committed to finding a way to heal the wounds of this tragedy and to bring our country together,"" said Senior Advisor Kellyanne Conway. ""And he believes that by looking at all of the factors that contributed to the violence, we can find a way to do just that.""
As the nation continues to grapple with the aftermath of the Charlottesville violence, President Trump's comments have added fuel to an already heated debate. While some see them as a necessary step towards healing and reconciliation, others view them as a failure to take a clear stance against hate and extremism. Only time will tell which side of the debate will ultimately prevail."

For Meghan, the US publication claims the pregnancy is not just a huge joy but an 'enormous relief.'

Meanwhile Prince William, 36, was 'initially shocked when Kate told him he's going to be a dad again', but now he sees it as a 'happy surprise.'  'He and Kate have always wanted four kids,' the source tells.  And this time around, adds the source, Kate gets to share her pregnancy journey with not only her young sister Pippa, 34, who is due with her first child in a few months, but her new sister-in-law, too.

Tobey Maguire Clears Name of Alleged Chateau Marmont Encounter
LOS ANGELES - In a shocking turn of events, actor Tobey Maguire has categorically denied a recent tabloid report suggesting he pursued and obtained the phone number of actress Emma Stone at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles.
According to a reliable source close to Maguire, the 41-year-old actor was in the midst of a late-night dinner at the iconic restaurant when he was suddenly approached by a group of overzealous paparazzi. Despite the chaos, Maguire remained unfazed and politely declined to comment on the baseless rumors.
""Tobey was never interested in Emma Stone, and the idea that he would go to such great lengths to get her phone number is simply preposterous,"" the source revealed. ""He's a professional, and he doesn't need to resort to such tactics to impress a colleague or any other woman for that matter.""
Maguire's representative has also issued a statement confirming the actor's version of events, stating, ""Tobey has never pursued Emma Stone, and he finds these types of tabloid reports to be utterly ridiculous and disrespectful.""
The allegations come as a surprise to many, given Maguire's reputation as a respected and dedicated actor, who has been married to his wife, jewelry designer Jennifer Meyer, since 2003.
While the tabloid report may have sparked a frenzy of speculation, it appears that Maguire's name has been cleared of any wrongdoing. The actor continues to focus on his craft, with several high-profile projects in the works, including an upcoming superhero flick and a drama series for Netflix.
In the meantime, fans of Maguire and Stone can rest assured that their favorite stars are not involved in any illicit romantic escapades."

There was a station for guests to get a vitamin infusion, with seats in the direct line of the sun transforming the spot into an inescapable sauna-I.V. drip hybrid.

This was the highlight of his year,” she said. “It was this time last year that we were told he wasn’t gonna make it another week, and he pushed us and he said, ‘Go to the party. Maybe I won’t be here when you come back, but go.’”  Shapiro, who now lives in London while she works on her master’s degree, admits that she can’t watch old episodes of Real Housewives, which showed her as 14-year-old struggling to get close to her stepfather. “You want to think that it’s like a home movie, but it’s not.

And now they’re all corporate. . . . We’re home. It’s cyclical, you know.”  Lohan also revealed that the upcoming series is a bit of a family affair with Lindsay’s younger sister, 24-year-old Ali, providing the theme song.  A friend of Lohan’s interjected, asking if Ali, like her older sister over a decade ago, had moved out to L.A. for work.  “She’s in New York with me,” the matriarch answered. “I keep them close!

Two of Robert Kardashian's ex-wives have come forward saying he confided in them that he was unsure of the paternity of the now-27-year-old.  Jan Ashley, who married the businessman after Khloe's mother Kris Jenner, said: 'Khloe is not his kid -- he told me that after we got married.'  And Ellen Pierson, 63, who married Robert in 2003 just two months before his death, has also come forward after eight years of silence to 'tell the truth' about the Kardashian family.  Claims: Two of Robert Kardashian's ex-wives have come forward claiming the lawyer told them Khloe Kardashian, left, was not his real daughter, like older sisters Kim and Kourtney  The reality star has hit back at the claims, calling them 'really low'.  In an explosive interview with Star magazine, Ashley said: 'He just kind of looked at me and said [it] like it was a matter of fact.

She claims Khloe, who is married to Dallas Mavericks basketballer Lamar Odom, knew she had a different father to her sisters and younger brother Rob.  'Khloe brought it up all the time. She looked nothing like the rest. She was tall, had a different shape, light hair, curly hair. Didn't look anything like the other three children.'  Different: Khloe has often pointed out that she looks nothing like her older sisters and their mother Kris, far right, said once people asked whether she was 'the milkman's child'  Fighting back: Khloe has responded to the claims today on Twitter She said Robert, who is of Armenian descent, had told her that he and Kris were not sleeping together at the time Khloe was conceived.

gossipcop-5865271192,1,0,"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired.

It received positive reviews from critics and audiences, who praised its subject matter and acting, particularly the performances of Minnette and Langford. For her performance, Langford received a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress in a Drama Series.

Inside he discovers seven cassette tapes recorded by Hannah Baker, his deceased classmate and unrequited love, who committed suicide two weeks earlier. On the tapes, Hannah unfolds an intensely emotional audio diary, detailing why she decided to end her life. It appears each person who receives this package of old-style tapes is fundamentally related to why she killed herself. Clay is not the first to receive the tapes, but there is implied detail as to how he should pass the tapes on after hearing them. There appears to be an order to distribution of the tapes, with an additional copy held by an overseer should the plan go awry. Each tape recording refers to a different person involved in Hannah's life contributing to a reason for her suicide. The tapes refer to both friends and enemies. In season two, months after Hannah's suicide, Clay and the other people mentioned on the tapes, as well as close friends and Hannah's family members, become embroiled in a civil legal battle between Hannah's parents and Liberty High School. Alleging negligence on the part of the school, Hannah's mother pursues her perception of justice, while her reluctance to settle pre-trial and her personal circumstances eventually break up her marriage with Hannah's father.

Magazine is reporting that the ""Wildest Dreams"" singer has been contacting her ex ever since he has been in New York City starring in the Broadway show called Sunday in the Park With George.  The tabloid is reporting that a source is saying that Taylor is the one reaching out to the actor since she feels she is now more mature than she was when they dated back in 2010.  The source said, “Taylor was so young when they dated, she wasn’t ready for a serious relationship, but now she’s showing Jake how much she’s matured. She’s excited to see where things go.”  In 2015, a rumor swirled around saying that the stars were in contact with each other, even though she was dating Calvin Harris at the time.

In June, Jake ran into Cara Delevingne at The Graham Norton Show and asked for Taylor’s new number. They’ve kept in touch, albeit secretly, ever since.""  This would all be so ironic since Taylor allegedly wrote the hit song ""We Are Never Getting Back Together"" from her Red album about the relationship after her ex's friend asked her if they were giving their relationship a second chance.  “This guy walks in who is a friend of my ex’s and starts talking about how he’s heard we’re going to get back together.

In the video for the song, the actor who plays the singer's love interest gives her a scarf which many thought to be a clue that revealed the song was about Jake since she had been photographed wearing one of his scarfs while they were dating.

But there’s no reason to believe we’ll learn more anytime soon. In July of 2016, Aniston wrote a pretty searing op-ed for HuffPost in which she scolded paparazzi that are constantly obsessed with whether she’s in love or having babies.  “For the record, I am not pregnant,” she wrote then. “What I am is fed up.

gossipcop-2388806885,1,0,"R. Kelly’s time may have finally come. R. Kelly has been accused of sexual relationships with minors going back to 1994, when he married 15-year-old pop star Aaliyah. (The marriage was annulled.) In the 24 years since then, he has been sued multiple times for inappropriate sexual contact with a minor (he settled out of court every time), and he was eventually charged with creating child pornography. (A jury found him not guilty on the grounds that they could not conclusively identify the other figure in his infamous sex tape as a child.) Last summer, he was accused of creating an abusive “sex cult” of very young women, whom he allegedly isolates, brainwashes, and abuses physically and emotionally. Since the story broke, multiple women have added their own testimonies of abuse at R. Kelly’s hands. (Through a lawyer, Kelly denied all accusations, saying he would “work diligently and forcibly to pursue his accusers and clear his name.”) And in April, another woman accused Kelly of “knowingly and intentionally infecting her with an STD.” Her lawyers say they are currently preparing a federal civil lawsuit. Through a spokesperson, Kelly issued a statement to the Washington Post in which he “categorically denies all claims and allegations.” As man after man has fallen to the #MeToo reckoning, losing jobs and retiring from public life after being accused of sexual harassment and assault, there’s been a recurring whisper: What about R. Kelly? Despite decades of lawsuits and allegations, Kelly’s career has marched steadily on. Last year, he finished an arena tour with a few cancellations. This year, he’s touring with singer Charlie Wilson (some protests are planned). His music appeared in Pitch Perfect 3. At this year’s Coachella, rapper Vince Staples repeatedly referred to Kelly as a “child molester” in an interview with Complex, insisting, “He pees on people.” In our post-#MeToo, post-Time’s Up, post-Harvey Weinstein world, and given the sheer volume of allegations against Kelly, it seems reasonable to raise the question of why he continues to work as much as he does. But Staples’s interviewer only giggled nervously and protested, “We can’t ever talk about this guy. ... You’re about to get me fired from Coachella. It’s my first time here.” Later, Staples tweeted that “R. Kelly people is looking for me.” ladies and gentlemen, vince staples on r kelly pic.twitter.com/SmZdYu9PNJ — andy (@aboynamedandy) April 16, 2018 That stasis may be starting to change. Most of the claims against Kelly were reiterated in a recent BBC Three documentary, R Kelly: Sex, Girls & Videotapes. And over the past year, at least five members of Kelly’s inner circle have left him. His assistant, his accountant, his lawyer, and his rep have all said that they no longer work for him, although none of them have gone into detail about their departures and all have been supportive and complimentary toward Kelly in their statements. His longtime musical accompanist, DJ Phantom, was less circumspect about his decision to leave Kelly in December: “I didn’t know then what I know now,” he said. “He’s a shitbag.” In April, the Women of Color committee within Time’s Up threw its weight behind the #MuteRKelly campaign, calling for anyone currently profiting from Kelly and his music to drop him, including Spotify, Ticketmaster, and Kelly’s record label, RCA. Shortly thereafter, Spotify announced that it would no longer be promoting Kelly’s music, although his music would remain in their streaming catalog. It’s possible that these new developlments mean things are changing for Kelly, and that he’s about to face lasting consequences for those accusations. But if that’s the case, those consequences took more than two decades to reach him. There is a persistent vagueness to the way we talk about R. Kelly that makes it possible to forget exactly what he’s been accused of, how often he’s been accused, and how much proof there is against him. And most likely, that’s because his alleg","In the wake of a new documentary that claims to expose the singer’s alleged abuse of underage girls, Kelly’s time in the spotlight may be coming to an end. As the New York Times reports, the documentary features interviews with several women who claim that Kelly engaged in sexual relationships with them when they were minors.
According to the Times, the documentary also includes previously unseen footage of Kelly with one of his alleged victims, who was just 14 years old at the time of the encounter.
Despite Kelly’s denials of any wrongdoing, the documentary’s release has sparked renewed calls for the singer to face legal consequences for his actions.
In a statement, Kelly’s lawyer, Steven Gruber, called the documentary “a one-sided and distorted portrayal of Mr. Kelly’s life and career.” However, the documentary’s director, dream hampton, has stood by her work, saying that she has “tried to present a fair and balanced picture of Mr. Kelly’s history of abuse.”
As the dust settles on this latest controversy, it is clear that R. Kelly’s time in the spotlight may be coming to an end. The allegations against him are serious and disturbing, and it is time for him to face the consequences of his actions."

Here’s how the Biebs is coping with his time apart from Sel.  Justin Bieber, 24, is going through a tough time as his relationship with Selena Gomez, 25, is on pause. She’s currently on vacation with friends in Sydney, Australia, where she appears to be carefree in this new video. However, a source reveals that the same can’t be said for Bieber. “Justin has Selena on the brain constantly. He is trying to drown it out by hanging with friends and doing stuff on his own time but he keeps thinking about her,” a source EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com. “He always wants to be around her, talk to her and be with her. She is like a drug for him, he just needs more and more and more.”  As the Biebs continues to struggle with their time apart, he’s got a few things up his sleeve for when she returns to LA. “He can’t wait until she is back because he wants to really wine and dine her upon her return and really kick start the relationship back up again,” the insider reveals. It’s unclear when Sel is scheduled to return to the West Coast. But, as seen on her Instagram, she is having the time of her life. She posted a video which showed her laughing on a boat, accompanied by a subliminal message, that she “chose” to take care of herself, “not to prove anything to anyone.” Was she trying to give us insight into her most recent split with Bieber?  Jelena fans went into panic mode after seeing Sel in the arms of another man on a boat on March 19. She was photographed hugging and goofing off in photos with Sydney native, Johnny Rays. While all signs point to a friendship between the two, the photos didn’t appear that way to some fans who claimed they looked too close for comfort.  While Sel has been vacationing Down Under, Bieber has been staying active. He’s been photographed playing hockey and soccer with friends. However, his emotions may be getting the best of him as he took a gnarly fall during a soccer game on March 19, and seemingly broke down on the sidelines of a hockey game on March 17.  As you may recall, Jelena reunited in October 2017, after her split with The Weeknd, 28. They seemed inseparable, having spent New Year’s together in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. However, their romance took a rocky turn around Bieber’s birthday on March 1, according to reports.","Title: Justin Bieber Struggling with Selena Gomez Split as She Smiles on Australian Vacation
Justin Bieber is reportedly finding it difficult to come to terms with his recent split from Selena Gomez as she was spotted smiling and enjoying her Australian vacation, according to a source close to the situation.
The 23-year-old pop star and his on-again, off-again girlfriend of two years called it quits last week, and while Gomez has been flaunting her sun-kissed skin and carefree attitude on social media, Bieber is said to be feeling ""lost and confused.""
A source told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY, ""Justin is really struggling with the breakup. He and Selena had been on and off for so long, he thought this time was different. But now he's feeling like he's lost his best friend and the only person he truly trusted.""
The insider added, ""He's been reaching out to her, trying to make things right, but she's not interested. It's a tough pill for him to swallow, but he's trying to keep his head up and move on.""
Despite his heartache, Bieber has been focusing on his music and spending time with friends and family. ""He's been in the studio working on new music and has been spending time with his loved ones. He's trying to keep busy and distract himself from the pain of the breakup,"" the source revealed.
While Gomez's recent Instagram posts may suggest otherwise, a source close to the actress told HollywoodLife.com that she's actually ""devastated"" over the breakup and is taking time for herself to process her emotions.
The breakup between Bieber and Gomez comes just months after the pair rekindled their romance in the summer of 2018. Despite their on-again, off-again relationship, the two had been spotted together numerous times in recent months, leading fans to believe that they were back on track.
However, according to sources close to the situation, Bieber and Gomez's relationship had been on shaky ground for months, with the pop star reportedly feeling suffocated by their constant public appearances and Gomez feeling like she was losing herself in their relationship.
Despite the breakup, both Bieber and Gomez have remained mum on social media, with neither of them addressing the split publicly. However, fans of the couple are no doubt hoping that the two will find a way to work through their issues and get back together in the future."

Madonna was hit with a series of “uncomfortable questions” by a judge before she was granted permission to adopt her 4-year-old twin girls from Malawi, the presiding judge said in court documents obtained by The Associated Press on Wednesday, February 8.  “The petitioner is a professional performer and I guarded myself against the danger of her merely reciting a well-rehearsed speech by asking her some rather uncomfortable questions to which she gave very candid answers,” Judge Fiona Mwale said in her ruling, explaining her reasons for approving the adoption.  After pressing Madonna, 58, to explain her intentions in adding two more little ones to her brood of four, Judge Mwale said she was satisfied that the girls would be in good hands with the Material Girl.  “There is no doubt that the petitioner can offer the infants not only the best education money can buy, but also guidance with a high likelihood of ensuring that the two infants grow to be self-sufficient adults,” Judge Mwale said, adding that she is satisfied that Madonna “is motivated by her desire to offer a home, love, protection and guidance to the infants.”  In the court documents, Judge Mwale addressed prior controversies surrounding Madonna’s adoptions in Malawi. “In determining her motives, I questioned the petitioner at length about the impact of her decision which could be construed as robbing Malawi of its most precious resource, its children,” the judge wrote.  As previously reported, Madonna filed for adoption in High Court in Malawi on January 25 but tried to keep the process under wraps until a final decision was made. (The Queen of Pop issued a statement denying her adoption to Us Weekly that same day, claiming that she was in Malawi “to check on the children’s hospital in Blantyre.”) According to the AP, she has already raised $7.5 million for a pediatric surgery ward at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, which is set to open early next year.  Madonna previously adopted son David and daughter Mercy James, both 11, from Malawi in 2008 and 2009, respectively. She is also mom to daughter Lourdes, 20, whom she shares with ex Carlos Leon, and son Rocco, 16, whom she shares with ex-husband Guy Ritchie.  Madonna’s twin girls will retain their birth names as a part of an effort to preserve their identity as Malawian nationals, the court documents said, and their father was at the January 25 court hearing with Madonna. (The twins’ mother died within a week of childbirth due to health complications.)  On Wednesday, February 8, Madonna took to social media to share the happy news. “I can officially confirm I have completed the process of adopting twin sisters from Malawi and am overjoyed that they are now part of our family,” she captioned an image of herself walking between the two little girls. “I am deeply grateful to all those in Malawi who helped make this possible, and I ask the media please to respect our privacy during this transitional time. 🙏🏻 Thank you also to my friends, family and my very large team for all your support and Love!”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!

They were also reportedly seen together at Nick Cave's concert in Israel that same month.

Now, please write your news piece:
After months of speculation and denials, it appears that Dakota Johnson and Chris Martin have officially entered a romantic relationship. According to sources close to the couple, the two have been 'definitely dating' for several months now and have grown 'very comfortable' with each other. The news comes after the pair was spotted together at a private dinner in Los Angeles last week, where they were 'inseparable.' 'They couldn't keep their hands off each other,' a source revealed. The development is certainly unexpected, given that both Johnson and Martin have been married before. Johnson, of course, was famously linked to Coldplay frontman Chris Martin after the two starred in the Fifty Shades franchise together. Martin, on the other hand, was married to actress Gwyneth Paltrow for 10 years before their divorce in 2016. Despite their past marriages, it seems that Johnson and Martin have found love once again. The two have yet to comment on their relationship publicly, but sources close to the couple say they are 'very happy' together."

DeGeneres, who has been a household name for decades, has been struggling to come to terms with the decline of her popularity and the changing times in the entertainment industry.

Something as simple as a picture of Aniston with her hand on her stomach is proof enough for some tabloids that the actress is expecting a baby. Now, a new report claims that the Friends star has hired a surrogate, could there be any truth to the story?  In the new issue of Star, the tabloid features the headline, “Jen To Justin: I’ll Raise Our Baby Alone!” followed by a story that asserts Aniston wants to become a mom, and she will do it with or without her husband. The publication claims to have a source that reveals Aniston’s marriage is “on the rocks,” and she is planning to be a single mom.  ?…❤️✌️ A post shared by @justintheroux on Aug 5, 2017 at 4:23pm PDT  “Privately, she has told friends that she’s secretly gone ahead and hired a surrogate mother to carry her child to birth. And she’s vowed to raise the baby alone,” tells the insider.  But then the source says the actress is hoping to choose the right woman soon, completely contradicting the earlier quote, which is a huge red flag that something isn’t right with this claim.  But many think the tabloid story is completely false and contradictory quotes prove the story is garbage, questioning why the insider is sharing such private and secret information with a tabloid.  This is the same magazine that published a story earlier this year claiming Aniston herself was pregnant, but then didn’t mention that at all in its latest baby claims.  Aniston told Glamour magazine back in August that not only are the pregnancy tabloid stories guilty of body shaming, but they are also an invasion into a private matter between her and her husband.

gossipcop-5840642713,1,0,"Sky high prices are reportedly keeping fans from buying tickets to Taylor Swift’s upcoming Reputation tour, per a story by the New York Post. Though her 1989 world tour boasted numerous sold out performances (it eventually became the highest grossing tour of 2015), it appears her considerably more expensive snake persona is a tougher sell.  Last month, her “longtime” tour promoter told Billboard, “By the time all the tickets are sold next week, I’ll be celebrating Taylor’s birthday with a cocktail in my hand and sold-out concerts all over the world.” But her birthday has come and gone, and not one date has sold out.  Reputation was the biggest-selling album of 2017 and the tour is shaping up to be far from ill-attended, so the Post’s headline, “Taylor Swift’s Reputation tour shaping up to be a disaster,” is a little much. It does, however, highlight the problems with unpredictable pricing, scalpers, and Ticketmaster in general.  The company’s “Verified Fan” program, which they would like you to believe is all about rewarding music lovers, appears to be nothing but a cash grab that takes advantage of Swift-obsessed teens with easy access to their parents’ credit card numbers. People willing to drop $50 on merch, the Post reports, could “improve [their] position in line to purchase tickets.” And, once accessible, the tickets are often too expensive for many fans.  “I paid $150 for my ticket with amazing seats for the 1989 tour,” one fan wrote. “Now for the same seats I have to pay about $500.”  Advertisement  In related news, tickets to Katy Perry’s Friday show in New Orleans are currently starting at $23.","The Reputation tour, which kicks off in May, marks Swift's first major concert tour since the release of her highly successful album of the same name last year.
According to a source close to the situation, Swift's team has been working hard to address the issue of high ticket prices, which have been cited as a major deterrent for potential fans.
Swift's management has reportedly been in talks with ticketing companies to explore options for more affordable pricing options, including the possibility of offering cheaper tickets for fans who are willing to buy them in bulk.
The source added that Swift's team is also considering other ways to make the tour more accessible to fans, such as offering VIP packages that include perks like meet-and-greets and exclusive merchandise.
Despite these efforts, some fans have already expressed frustration on social media, with some claiming that the prices are still too high and that they will not be able to attend the tour.
In response to these concerns, Swift's team has issued a statement urging fans to be patient and to keep an eye out for any special deals or promotions that may be announced in the coming weeks.
The statement read: ""We understand that ticket prices may be a barrier for some fans, but we are working hard to make the Reputation tour as accessible as possible. We will be announcing special deals and promotions in the coming weeks, so please stay tuned!""

(Buchanan County Sheriff via AP) Iowa farmer Chris Soules, a former star on ABC’s “The Bachelor” who charmed reality TV viewers with his small-town life, was arrested this week after police said he fled a crash that killed a fellow farmer. Soules, 35, was charged with leaving the scene of a fatal crash, a class D felony, and could face up to five years in prison if he is convicted. The case has garnered the attention of Soules’s “Bachelor” fans as well as residents of Arlington, Iowa, where he lives, who had come to appreciate the reality TV star’s work as an unofficial Iowa ambassador and farm industry advocate. “This story is going to spread like wildfire around here and probably all over because of who he is,” Mary Jo Brown, Arlington’s city clerk, told the Des Moines Register. “Sometimes fame isn’t your friend.” Soules, who also appeared in “Dancing with the Stars” and “Worst Chefs in America,” called 911 at 8:20 p.m. Monday evening to report that he had rear-ended a tractor on a rural road north of the tiny town of Aurora, about six miles away from his home. The tractor veered into a ditch after being struck by his 2008 Chevrolet Silverado, Soules said. The tractor driver — later identified as 66-year-old Kenneth Mosher, a Vietnam War veteran — was unconscious and not breathing, Soules told the 911 operator, according to audio obtained by local media. The man had a pulse, but there was blood around his mouth, Soules said. Soules identified himself on the call, which lasted nearly six minutes, and sounded frantic. Between heavy breathing, he answered the dispatcher’s questions and took instructions. Soules told the 911 operator he did not know how to perform CPR and could be heard asking unidentified people at the scene if they could perform the lifesaving measure. The call ended abruptly after the operator told Soules law enforcement and medical first responders were on the way. “Can I, can I call you back really quick?” Soules asked the dispatcher. “Yeah, you can call me back,” she says. “Thank you,” Soules responds. Soules left the crash site after emergency responders arrived, but before deputies with the Buchanan County Sheriff’s Office were on the scene, according to authorities. Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Scott Bright told the Des Moines Register that Soules fled the scene on foot and later got into a truck. In police audio obtained by local media, a deputy told a dispatcher that Soules “took off” in a red truck. Authorities are trying to identify who picked up Soules in the truck, Buchanan County Sheriff Bill Wolfgram told the Associated Press. That person could face charges, he said. Alcohol was found at the scene and investigators are trying to determine whose it was and whether it or speed were factors in the crash. Soules was arrested about five hours after the incident and booked into the Buchanan County Jail, the Associated Press reported. He posted a $10,000 bond Tuesday morning and was released on the condition that he surrender his passport and wear an electronic monitor. During his first appearance in court, the Buchanan County assistant attorney told the judge that Soules refused to cooperate with law enforcement after they located him at his home. He “would not come out,” the attorney said, until officials obtained a search warrant, which “took hours.” Chris Soules making his initial court appearance in Buchanan County @KWWL pic.twitter.com/72bvEg0wVR — Elizabeth Amanieh (@EAmaniehKWWL) April 25, 2017 Wolfgram told the Associated Press that investigators were “running into some roadblocks when it comes to getting information” but acknowledged Soules was acting within his constitutional rights. According to court documents, Soules had several run-ins with the law in his early 20s. In 2011, he was charged three times with underage alcohol possession and pleaded guilty and paid a fine for an open container violation, reported the Des Moines R","The 35-year-old Soules, who was driving a pickup truck that struck and killed 66-year-old Kenny Shelton of nearby Aurora, Iowa, was booked into the Buchanan County Jail on Wednesday. Soules, who was released on $50,000 bond, is scheduled to appear in court on April 26 to face charges of leaving the scene of a fatal accident. The accident occurred around 8:20 p.m. Monday on a rural road near Aurora, about 20 miles northeast of Waterloo, Iowa. According to police, Soules was driving north on Iowa Highway 218 when he collided with Shelton, who was driving a tractor south on the same road. Soules, who was the 2015 “Bachelor” and appeared on “Dancing with the Stars,” has been a prominent figure in the reality TV world since his appearance on the show in 2015.

Bring in a referee, talk it over, and I swear to you, it will dispel by the end of the session, each time!” he said. “Sometimes in a tough marriage, it’s tough to talk, but if you do, it works!”  The 77-year-old actor has also learned to maintain his marriage with Streisand by not interrupting her during hectic times.  “When she’s busy, she’s really focused, and part of our good relationship is that I understand that,” he shared. “And if I come to her with something important and she says, ‘I don’t have time right now,’ she doesn’t have time, period.

Up till tpo that moment Crazy Jo-lie had kept Brad far from Jen. Make no mistake about it. Her frantic traveling all over the place was an attempt at keeping Pitt away from her and and any other person who might think they were a friend. She can't stand anyone but her having anything to do with Pitt . Including his own family. I knew it would backfire one day. Brad what took so long????? She suffers from an extreme mental illness. She doesn't have the kids in school for the same reason.  I do believe she thought it would last. Seeing how sexy and pretty she thinks she is. A man should and would do anything she tells them to.  I am under the impression her treatment of her surrogate Holly had a sort of wake up call to Pitt as to how utterly evil she is. You can bet she dismissed her like a piece of shite. A woman who carried twins for her. Started making Brad see her game of using and abusing.  And when Jen said her and Brad talk all the time on the phone you know that was news to little miss do as I say not as I do Angelina still talks to her ex's Jo-LIE.    Guess all the years of trying to force Brad to believe Jen was a shallow no good woman has a way of catching up to one. It took this long for Pitt to see just what had truly happened. Her spells have lost the power to confuse.In Touch said she has a terrible jealous streak and can't stand Brad even looking at a woman SHE DEEMS ATTRACTIVE IN ANY WAY. WE ALL KNOW HOW MUCH FUN THAT CAN BE.    The National Enquirer  Says Brad is so happy to have a separation from her.Brad's closest friends are woman and that drives Angelina nuts she hates sharing him  He was mad she took the salt role because she had promised him she would stay at home and be a mom.  I mean you can see her doing whatever she damn well wanted to. And he went along with it. But they have twin babies and my guess is she spends very little time bonding with them. What woman would not want to be able to stay with her new little babies. Not this woman. Sick behavior for sure. And the only thing keeping Brad from making it final is the kids.

There comes a time in every couple's relationship when the question of moving in together becomes impossible to ignore. And when those two lovebirds have been stepping out for 15 months — even though they live 3,500 miles apart; he in the UK, she in Canada — it's not so much a case of 'if' as of 'when' they will settle down. So it comes as no surprise that Prince Harry, 33, and his actress girlfriend Meghan Markle, 36, are said to be house-hunting. £7.25million - North Aston Manor, Oxfordshire: This eight bedroom property, overlooking the stunning Cherwell Valley, has seven reception rooms, a spa, swimming pool and 18.2 acres with equestrian facilities. It's nine miles from Soho Farmhouse and swanky shopping centre Bicester Village, should Meghan fancy snapping up some designer bargains Prince Harry and actress girlfriend Meghan Markle were pictured together at the Invictus Games in Toronto last month Royal sources have exclusively told the Daily Mail that the royal couple are looking in Oxfordshire and are particularly interested in high-end properties tucked away in the rolling Cotswold hills. A good friend of Harry's says the Prince, whose father's residence, Highgrove House, is in the south Cotswolds, has a long-standing affection for the area, while Meghan is said to be entranced by its rustic charm. 'He is searching for a new home in the area,' the friend reveals. 'Before Meghan, he was vaguely looking in Norfolk, but didn't find what he wanted. Now, with her input, he's renewed his search.' £2million - The Old Rectory, Lower Brailes, Oxfordshire: A stunning wood-panelled property dating from the 14th century, this boasts eight bedrooms, a sun-drenched terrace and its own private lake, complete with duck house. There’s a three-bedroom coach house for guests and it’s set at the end of a no-through road. Certainly, the lush green countryside encompassing swathes of Warwickshire, Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire is a huge draw for London-dwellers eager to snap up rural boltholes. Just an hour or so from the capital, it's home (or at least a weekend retreat) to A-listers, politicians and media executives: the Camerons, Beckhams, Kate Moss, Lily Allen and Stella McCartney all have million-pound properties in the area. 'It's like a magnet,' says Sophie Gannon, of Savills Estate Agents in Banbury, Oxfordshire. 'If you get one person, you get them all.' However, Harry isn't following the crowd but listening to his heart. The Cotswolds, and specifically Highgrove, which was bought by his father's private estate in 1980, is where the Prince spent much of his childhood. It was Charles and Diana's weekend home, with 15-acre grounds and, later on, a teenage haven in the cellars of the main house, which Harry nicknamed 'Club H'. £2.95million - Fanthill, Banbury, Oxfordshire: Accessed through electric gates, up a winding driveway, this eight-bedroom house sits among 20 acres of land, so ticks all Harry’s boxes when it comes to privacy. There’s a heated outdoor pool, miniature golf course and a carp lake, where the young lovebirds could row off the private pier A local who knows the family says: 'It's not surprising that Harry would like to live where he feels at home. 'He's lived in the Cotswolds all his life and often returns to visit his father. After his mother died, it became a place of sanctuary. 'When the boys entered their teens, Charles bought several homes in the area, thinking they might want one in the future.' Ten years ago, Charles bought up properties adjacent to his sprawling estate, paying £2 million apiece for nearby manor houses and farm buildings.

The couple, who have long been associated with the picturesque countryside of Norfolk, have expressed a desire to mingle with a 'groovier' set in the trendy Cotswolds.
According to sources close to the couple, the Royals are eager to experience the vibrant nightlife and cultural scene of the Cotswolds, which has seen a surge in popularity in recent years. 'They want to be seen with the cool kids,' a friend of the couple revealed. 'They're sick of the same old stuffy parties in Norfolk.'
The local estate agents are said to be thrilled at the prospect of the Royal couple choosing their area as their new hangout.

It’s no secret that Jennifer Lopez-at 48-has a body that won’t quit and skin that needs to be studied so we can all age like the goddess she is.  Dramatic? Not even close.  And while a lot of it may be down to great genes, Lopez has revealed in a new interview some of her beauty secrets and yep, they’re as diva as you might expect.  Lopez credits her glow to positive affirmations, revealing she says one in particular to herself every day to keep her radiant, youthful look intact.  So what is this magic phrase?  “I am youthful and timeless at every age,” Lopez says every single day—but it’s not enough to just say the mantra daily, because Lopez also has a handful of pillows with these words and more mantras embroidered into them all over her home. “I tell myself that every day, a few times a day. It sounds like clichéd bullshit, but it’s not: Age is all in your mind. Look at Jane Fonda.”  Lopez continues, “The affirmations are everywhere. I forget that they’re all here. They’re just part of the house now.”  Before you scoff at Lopez’s positivity there is a school of thought that believes negative thoughts can age you. Australian-born Dr Blackburn, a Nobel Prize winner, co-authored The Telomere Effect: A Revolutionary Approach to Living Younger, Healthier, Longer, with anti-aging psychologist Dr Elissa Epel, which investigated the link between telomeres, which protect our chromosomes, and the effect stress, sleep and diet can have on telomeres and how that directly corresponds with our health.  The book asserts there is a correlation between depression and anxiety and shorter telomeres and that “when pessimists develop an aging-related illness, like cancer or heart disease, the illness tends to progress faster.”  And really there's only so far a little highlight can go, step one is all about a positive attitude. Step two is to find yourself a great pillowcase and settle on your new mantra.  So what’s the lesson here? Your inner glow is only a glass half full attitude away.","But what you may not know is that the secret to her glow is not just a skincare routine, but a silk pillowcase that she swears by. And now, the rest of us can reap the benefits of this luxurious sleep hack. According to sources close to J-Lo, she’s been sleeping on a silk pillowcase for years and it’s been a game-changer for her skin. The soft, smooth texture of the silk doesn’t allow for friction, which means less breakage and fewer wrinkles in the morning. Plus, the anti-aging properties of silk help to plump and firm the skin while you sleep, leaving you looking refreshed and rejuvenated. So if you want to wake up with J-Lo’s glow, consider giving silk pillowcases a try. They may just become your new sleep essential."

Each time Channing and Jenna head to mediation to discuss the terms of their divorce, “they can’t seem to agree on anything,” says a source. “Their meetings have been contentious.” One big issue: their five-year-old daughter, Everly. “They can’t agree on custody,” a friend tells In Touch exclusively.

Though Jenna, 37, has had a successful movie and TV career with shows like Supergirl, Channing, 38, has starred in several blockbusters, such as Magic Mike and 21 Jump Street, and was the family’s main breadwinner. “Jenna has told friends that she gave Channing the best years of her life,” says the source, “and now she’s trying to negotiate a very secure future for herself.”  There is a lot at stake financially. During the course of their marriage, the pair acquired several assets, including a $6 million Beverly Hills home and pricey cars including a Tesla and a vintage Chevrolet truck. Finding common ground about dividing their stuff “is not easy,” says the friend. “They both want it to be over with.”          Jenna never thought it would come to this. “She isn’t pleased about how it’s all played out so far,” says the source. “She’s bitter. There are days when she’s blaming him for not working harder to save their marriage.” And while she’s told pals that she hopes they can stay friends, adds the source, deep down “she knows that’s never going to happen.”  Channing shouldn’t underestimate Jenna, says the source: “She’s looking out for herself, and at the end of the day she knows that he’s got to pay.

Photo credit: BACKGRID","Here is my attempt at writing a news piece based on the 'sentence' provided:
According to a shocking report from Radar, actor Ben Affleck is on the brink of a brain damage crisis following a recent altercation with his estranged wife, Jennifer Garner. A source close to the troubled 45-year-old has revealed that Affleck's erratic behavior has sparked concern among his inner circle, with many fearing for his well-being.
The insider, who spoke on condition of anonymity, claimed that Affleck's recent outbursts and mood swings have been a cause for alarm, particularly given his history of substance abuse. ""Ben's always had a problem with alcohol and drugs, and this latest incident has just added to his list of issues,"" the source said.
As Affleck's friends and family watch in horror, the actor's behavior has become increasingly unpredictable and dangerous. In recent days, he has been spotted lashing out at strangers on the street, and has even been accused of attacking a paparazzo.
Despite his recent successes on the big screen, including his critically-acclaimed turn in ""Argo,"" Affleck's personal life has been in shambles for months. His marriage to Garner, which ended in 2018, has been a source of constant drama, with the two sides engaging in a bitter and public custody battle over their three children.
As Affleck's crisis deepens, many are calling for him to seek professional help before it's too late. ""Ben's on a dangerous path, and someone needs to step in and save him before he hurts himself or someone else,"" said a close friend of the actor.
In a statement, Affleck's representatives denied any allegations of brain damage or substance abuse, insisting that he is ""fully aware of his surroundings"" and ""in perfect health."" However, given the mounting evidence to the contrary, it remains to be seen how long this denial can hold up.
As the situation continues to unfold, one thing is clear: Ben Affleck's brain damage crisis has reached a critical point, and the actor's loved ones and fans are holding their breath in the hopes that he can find the help he so desperately needs."

(Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) Ivanka Trump’s products weren’t always the hottest items online. In January, for instance, the first daughter’s fashion line ranked No. 550 based on the number of orders from Lyst, the biggest fashion e-commerce website in the world, according to Forbes. That changed dramatically the following month. Sales of Trump’s products skyrocketed in early February, making her Lyst’s 11th most popular brand. The biggest spike, according to Lyst, came on Feb. 9, when sales jumped by 219 percent from the day before. Yes, Feb. 9 — the same day that White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted Trump’s clothing and jewelry line on “Fox & Friends.” “Go buy Ivanka’s stuff is what I would tell you,” Conway said. “I’m going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody.” And viewers did, apparently. Sales of Ivanka Trump’s branded products skyrocketed on Feb. 9, the same day White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted the line on Fox News. (Lyst) Abigail Klem, president of the Ivanka Trump brand, said in a statement that “the beginning of February” shows “the best performing weeks in the history of the brand.” “For several different retailers, Ivanka Trump was a top performer online, and in some of the categories it was the best performance ever,” Klem said. Sarah Tanner, Lyst’s spokeswoman, said increases in sales are usually tied to current events. For instance, interest in pantsuits went up by 460 percent last year because of Hillary Clinton’s affinity for the style, she said. Sales of the first daughter’s products went up by 86 percent in November when her father won the presidential election, according to the company. Conway has come under fire for touting Ivanka Trump's clothing line during a televised interview. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) [A Trump wine boycott backfires spectacularly] But the brand was “largely featured” in the news in February, Tanner said. Conway gave her on-air endorsement of Ivanka Trump’s brand after President Trump had complained on Twitter that his daughter had “been treated so unfairly” by the department store Nordstrom, which dropped her clothing line over slow sales. “It would not be a surprise to us if it resulted in the increase in sales,” Tanner said of Conway’s Fox interview. “I think that’s one of the reasons the brand was largely in the news and could have attributed to this increase.” Conway did not respond to an email requesting comment. Her promotion of the fashion line appeared to violate an ethics rule barring federal employees from using their public office to endorse products and immediately drew criticism from both Democrats and Republicans. [Where does the Ivanka Trump brand go from here?] Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said Conway’s comments were “absolutely wrong, wrong, wrong” and “clearly over the line,” The Washington Post reported. The White House later said that Conway had been “counseled.” But concerns about her comments remain. On Thursday, the government’s top ethics official criticized the White House for not disciplining Conway, The Post’s Drew Harwell reported. Walter M. Shaub Jr., director of the Office of Government Ethics, had urged officials last month to reprimand the White House counsel but was rebuffed. On Thursday he wrote to Stefan C. Passantino, who handles White House ethics issues as the president’s deputy counsel. “When an employee’s conduct violates, disciplinary action serves to deter future misconduct,” Shaub wrote. “Not taking disciplinary action against a senior official under such circumstances risks undermining the ethics program.” [A Trump voter’s message to retailers: ‘Keep your mouths shut about our president’] Last month, a group of law professors filed a professional misconduct complaint against Conway — a","Title: Ivanka Trump's Rise to Power: A New Era for First Children
In a stunning turn of events, Ivanka Trump is set to become one of the most powerful first children in American history, despite not having an official job in the Trump administration. The 36-year-old senior advisor to her father, President Donald Trump, has been instrumental in shaping the Trump agenda, particularly when it comes to issues affecting women and families.
According to sources close to the White House, Ivanka Trump has been working behind the scenes to advance her father's policy priorities, including a comprehensive childcare plan and a major overhaul of the tax code. Her influence has been so significant that some have begun to refer to her as the ""de facto first lady,"" a title that has sparked both praise and criticism.
""Ivanka has been a game-changer for this administration,"" said one senior administration official. ""She brings a unique perspective to the table and has been a valuable asset in shaping the President's policies.""
But not everyone is convinced of Ivanka's growing influence. Some have raised concerns about the potential for conflicts of interest, given her role in the Trump family business. Others have criticized her lack of an official job in the administration, arguing that she should be more transparent about her role and responsibilities.
Despite these criticisms, Ivanka Trump remains a powerful force in the Trump administration, and her influence is only likely to grow in the coming months. As the President's senior advisor, she has already proven herself to be a shrewd and effective operator, and her growing profile has raised the bar for all future first children.
In a time of political polarization and division, Ivanka Trump's rise to power is a testament to the enduring power of the First Family and their ability to shape the course of American history."

In a bold move, Hollywood celebrities have come out strongly against President Donald Trump's decision to pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord. The move, which was announced on Thursday, has been met with widespread criticism from the entertainment industry, with many stars expressing their disappointment and concern over the potential impact on the environment.
""This is a disaster for our planet,"" said Leonardo DiCaprio, a long-time environmental activist and Oscar-winning actor. ""The Paris climate accord is a crucial step towards saving our planet, and it's unconscionable that the President would choose to abandon it.""
Other celebrities, including Jennifer Lawrence, Chris Hemsworth, and Emma Watson, have also spoken out against the decision, urging Trump to reconsider his stance and work towards a more sustainable future.
""As someone who has worked in the entertainment industry for many years, I know how important it is to protect our planet,"" said Lawrence. ""I urge President Trump to think about the impact his decision will have on future generations.""
The decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord has been met with widespread criticism from around the world, with many countries expressing their disappointment and concern over the move. The accord, which was signed in 2015, aims to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels.
Despite the criticism, Trump has insisted that the accord is ""draconian"" and ""not fair"" to the United States, and has vowed to ""renegotiate"" the deal. However, many experts have expressed skepticism over the possibility of renegotiating the accord, and have warned that the U.S. could face severe consequences if it fails to meet its climate commitments.
As the debate over the Paris climate accord continues, one thing is clear: the entertainment industry will not be silent on this issue. With its massive platform and influence, Hollywood will continue to use its voice to raise awareness and advocate for action on climate change."

South African Music Fans in for a Treat as Beyoncé Unveils Contract Requirements for Upcoming Tour
In a surprising turn of events, Beyoncé has revealed the personnel requirements for her upcoming concert in South Africa, as reported by The Times. According to the newspaper, the 67-page contract signed with Kusasa, the promoter of her South African leg of the tour, outlines the singer's demands for her entourage.
Firstly, Beyoncé has requested a team of at least 10 hairstylists to ensure that her elaborate hairdos are maintained throughout the show. This is in line with her signature look, which has become synonymous with her performances. Additionally, she has specified that only vegan catering will be allowed backstage, as she has adopted a plant-based diet for the time being.
The contract also stipulates that Beyoncé must be provided with a team of professional dancers, who will be trained to replicate her choreography from her previous tours. This is to ensure that her fans experience the same high-energy performances that they have come to expect from the singer.
Interestingly, the contract also includes a clause that requires Kusasa to provide Beyoncé with a private jet for the duration of her stay in South Africa. This is to ensure that the singer is able to travel comfortably and conveniently between shows.
While the requirements may seem excessive to some, Beyoncé's team has emphasized that they are necessary to ensure the smooth running of the tour. ""Beyoncé is a perfectionist, and she wants to deliver the best show possible for her fans,"" said a spokesperson for the singer. ""These requirements are in place to ensure that she has everything she needs to do just that.""
With tickets already selling out fast, South African music fans are in for a treat as Beyoncé brings her highly-anticipated tour to the country. The concert is set to take place on March 20th at the Ticketpro Dome in Johannesburg.

Jennifer Holliday is backing out of performing at Trump's inauguration celebration after receiving backlash from her fans. Kareem Quow for KQ Photography  Holliday, best known for her Tony-winning role in Broadway's ""Dreamgirls,"" faced pressure from her gay, lesbian and black fans when it was announced she would sing at a Thursday concert at Washington's Lincoln Memorial.  Holliday said in a statement Saturday that she apologized for her lapse of judgment, for being uneducated on the issues and causing heartbreak for her fans.  Several prominent entertainers have declined to perform at Trump inaugural festivities. Country star Toby Keith and actor Jon Voigt are in the lineup for Thursday's concert.  Holliday's reversal was first reported by The Wrap; the publication obtained a letter Holliday wrote to her fans. Her representative, Bill Carpenter, confirmed the details in the letter to The Associated Press.  ""My only choice must now be to stand with the LGBT Community and to state unequivocally that I WILL NOT PERFORM FOR THE WELCOME CONCERT OR FOR ANY OF THE INAUGURATION FESTIVITIES!"" she wrote.  ""Please know that I HEAR YOU and I feel your pain. The LGBT Community was mostly responsible for birthing my career and I am deeply indebted to you,"" she added. ""You have loved me faithfully and unconditionally and for so many years you provided me with work even though my star had long since faded.""  Related: Toby Keith, 3 Doors Down to Play Inauguration-Related Event  In an interview with The Associated Press on Friday, Holliday defended her decision to perform at the inauguration.  ""I didn't see it as singing for Trump; I saw it as singing for the people on the mall,"" Holliday told the AP.  The performer, who most recently starred on Broadway in ""The Color Purple,"" said she was hurt by the angry backlash, which included calls to boycott her music. Others called her ""Uncle Tom"" and there was even a suggestion that she take her own life.  ""It just really made my heart drop to my feet,"" Holliday said. ""How could I have this much hate spewing at me, and I haven't even done anything? I guess it's not like those old days when political views were your own and you had freedom of speech. ...

But Trump has insisted that's how he wants it, saying the swearing-in festivities should be about the people, not the A-list stars.","Here is my attempt:
Broadway Star Jennifer Holliday Pulls Out of Inauguration Performance, Citing Lack of Support for President-Elect Trump
In a shocking turn of events, Tony Award-winning actress Jennifer Holliday has announced that she will no longer be performing at next week's presidential inauguration. In a statement released to the press, Holliday expressed her disappointment and confusion over the sudden interpretation of her participation as a statement of support for President-elect Donald Trump.
""I was honored to be asked to perform at this historic event, and I was looking forward to being a part of it,"" Holliday said. ""However, I did not realize that my participation would be seen as a statement of support for President-elect Trump. I do not support any political party or candidate, and I believe that art should be used to bring people together, not tear them apart.""
Holliday's decision to pull out of the inauguration has sparked a heated debate on social media, with many fans expressing their disappointment and outrage over her decision. However, others have praised Holliday for standing by her principles and not allowing her art to be used for political purposes.
Despite the backlash, Holliday remains firm in her decision, stating that she will not be silenced or coerced into supporting any political agenda. ""As an artist, I have a responsibility to use my platform for good, and I will not compromise my values for any reason,"" she said.
The presidential inauguration is scheduled to take place next Wednesday, and it remains to be seen who will take Holliday's place on the bill. In the meantime, fans of the Broadway star are left to wonder what could have been, had she chosen to stand by her commitment and perform at the inauguration."
gossipcop-2194660040,1,0,"First Lady Melania Trump claims there is a secret poisoner in the White House and fears her husband is being slowly poisoned with “heavy sedatives” smuggled into his drinks in an attempt to slow him down, control him, and discredit his presidency, according to reports.  While public debate rages about Donald Trump’s health, Melania has told friends and associates that the once robust and high energy man she knew and loved has been replaced with a “slower, damaged version”.  “By 8pm he is slurring,” she said. “This is not the man I know.”  Fearing that the sedatives are being pumped into the body of the POTUS via Coca-Cola that he orders by pressing a button he had installed on the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, Melania has insisted he stop drinking from the tap and instead revert to drinking from cans she brings herself.  “Donald’s heath improved out of sight when he stopped drinking from the tap,” Melania said.  However the First Lady fears the active campaign to poison the president is “a high level operation” and “not the work of a solitary loon.”  Melania is popular in the White House—as she is with the rest of the country—and she has befriended senior intelligence agency staff who remain loyal to president. They have educated her about Ronald Regan’s poisoning by the Deep State after his assassination attempt in 1981. They have also warned her that George W. Bush was reduced to a “brain damaged” state after years of steady poisoning.  But the advantage Trump may hold over his GOP predecessors in the Oval Office is that he has a wife who is wise to the ruse and is insisting he watch his food and drink intake closely for signs of adulteration.  Donald Trump’s food choices say a lot about the man. The president’s Howard Hughes-level pickiness when it comes to food is partly motivated by a desire to avoid being poisoned, according to Melania. He doesn’t trust those around him – and rightfully so.  As President Trump knows all too well, there are enemies of the state dug in deep at the White House.  Reporters from TIME recently got a glimpse behind-the-scenes at the White House, where they reported on what goes down at the president’s dinner table. Of particular interest was a meal enjoyed by the reporters, Trump, and Vice President Pence.  Pence’s meal was not unusual—he ate what everyone else did. But the POTUS received a meal fully customized to his own preferences, and closely observed by Melania who insisted on watching the chef prepare the meal with ingredients she provided herself.","Here is the news piece I have written based on that sentence:
Washington D.C. – In a shocking turn of events, First Lady Melania Trump has made a bold claim regarding the ongoing presidency of her husband, President Donald Trump. Speaking to a select group of journalists yesterday, Mrs. Trump revealed that she believes there is a secret poisoner operating within the White House, who has been slowly poisoning the President with “heavy sedatives” smuggled into his drinks.
According to Mrs. Trump, she has reason to believe that this sinister plot has been underway for several months, and that the President has been the target of a deliberate attempt to slow him down, control him, and discredit his presidency.
“I have reason to believe that someone within our own ranks is trying to harm my husband,” Mrs. Trump said, her voice trembling with emotion. “It’s been going on for months, and I can’t stand idly by while this continues. The President is being slowly poisoned, and I fear for his safety and well-being.”
Mrs. Trump refused to name any suspects or provide further details on the alleged poisoning, citing the ongoing investigation and the need to protect the President’s safety. However, sources close to the First Lady have confirmed that she has been working closely with White House security officials to uncover the truth behind the mysterious poisonings.
The news has sent shockwaves through the political world, with many leaders and lawmakers calling for a full investigation into the matter. “This is a serious allegation, and it demands a thorough and impartial investigation,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. “The President and his family deserve to be protected from any and all threats to their safety and well-being.”
Meanwhile, the President has yet to comment on the allegations, but sources close to his administration have indicated that he is taking the matter very seriously and is working closely with his security team to ensure his safety.
As the investigation into the mysterious poisonings continues, one thing is clear: the safety and security of the President and his family are of the utmost importance, and any attempts to harm them will not go unpunished."

The action star has steadily starred in film after film, yet has been at the center of several dating rumors.  As the International Business Times reports, “The actor was mistakenly linked to an Australian journalist and then was associated to his Mission: Impossible 6 co-star and Crown actress Vanessa Kirby.”  All rumors until now have been stamped out as false.  However, the latest claims include those stating that members of the Church of Scientology have once again been playing matchmaker for the Top Gun star and that Cruise has reportedly been secretly dating over the past little while. Interestingly enough, Tom has reportedly been using a disguise to enjoy dates with the ladies, much like Katie Holmes did in the initial stages of her romance with Jamie Foxx.  A source told the publication about Cruise’s tactics to keep his love life out of the spotlight.  “Tom’s back on the dating scene, but nobody knows it’s him. His face is way too recognizable for him to stroll into the bars, so he has his makeup artist create a silicone mask. Seems like Tom took his Mission: Impossible role to heart. It’s just what Ethan Hunt would do in the movies.”  It’s also been claimed that the disguise, which includes makeup, takes a full five hours to apply. If this rumor all sounds a little far-fetched, that’s because it is completely untrue, according to Gossip Cop. Tom Cruise does not go through some elaborate process to secretly step out on dates. In fact, there has not been any confirmation that Tom Cruise has dated anyone since Katie Holmes.  Alberto E. Rodriguez / Getty Images  Katie Holmes, however, continues to attempt to keep her romance with Jamie Foxx a secret, despite the fact that the pair has been spotted on numerous occasions over the past year on beach getaways and romantic locales like Paris. Most recently the mysterious duo were spotted celebrating Jamie’s 50th birthday at a Santa Monica beach hotel last week, as Page Six relays.

Tom Cruise's Post-Divorce Focus on Career Raises Eyebrows
In a shocking turn of events, Tom Cruise has seemingly shifted his priorities away from his personal life and towards his thriving movie career. The actor, who was recently divorced from Katie Holmes, has been steadily working on multiple film projects, leaving many to wonder if he is avoiding the spotlight or simply focused on his craft.
According to industry insiders, Cruise has been in high demand on set, impressing directors and co-stars alike with his dedication and professionalism. ""Tom is a true pro,"" said one source, ""he's always pushing himself to deliver the best performance possible, even when the cameras are rolling for long hours.""
While Cruise's fans may be happy to see him back to work, some have speculated that the actor's sudden renewed focus on his career may be a subtle attempt to distract from his highly publicized divorce. However, those close to Cruise insist that his return to the silver screen is purely a creative decision.
""Tom has always been passionate about his work, and this is just the latest chapter in his illustrious career,"" said a representative for the actor. ""He's not trying to avoid anything, he's just doing what he loves.""
Regardless of the reasons behind it, Cruise's renewed focus on his career is undoubtedly a welcome sight for fans of the actor. With his next film set to hit theaters later this year, it's clear that Tom Cruise is here to stay – both on and off the screen."

Hart, who has been vocal about his commitment to his family and his Christian faith, took to social media to express his disappointment and outrage at the attempted extortion. ""I'm not gonna let these individuals get away with this,"" he wrote. ""I'm gonna fight for my family and my reputation, and I'm gonna make sure that these people are held accountable for their actions.""

According to reports, the couple had been seeing each other while they were still married to their respective spouses, a revelation that has left many in the entertainment industry stunned.

While Affleck and Shookus have yet to publicly comment on the reports, sources close to the couple have confirmed that they have been dating for several months.
The development has raised eyebrows, given that Affleck and Shookus were both married at the time. While it is not uncommon for celebrities to start dating new partners after a divorce, the fact that Affleck and Shookus were still technically married when they began their relationship has sparked a heated debate about the ethics of such behavior.
""It's unfortunate that Ben Affleck and Lindsay Shookus chose to pursue a relationship while they were still married,"" said celebrity watchdog Shirley Thompson. ""Their actions are a clear violation of the trust and commitment that are essential to any healthy relationship.""

Matt was a kind and generous colleague who treated me with respect. In fact, a joke I once made on late-night television was just that, because it was completely contrary to our brother-sister relationship. It’s still very upsetting. I really admire the way Savannah [Guthrie] and Hoda [Kotb] and the entire Today show staff have handled a very difficult situation.”  The late-night show joke that Couric refers to is when she said on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen in 2012 that Lauer “pinches me on the ass a lot.” A clip of the comment made the rounds online in the wake of Lauer’s firing.  Couric spent 15 years co-hosting NBC’s Today show with Lauer, 60, but left in May 2006 to anchor the CBS Evening News.  NBC/Getty  Lauer was fired at the end of November by NBC News after the network received a “detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior,” with reason to believe “this may not have been an isolated incident.” Women have also anonymously accused him of sexual harassment and assault in reports published by Variety and The New York Times.  Following his firing, which was announced live on Today by Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb, Lauer addressed the original allegations in a statement.  “There are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions,” he said, in part. “To the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry. As I am writing this, I realize the depth of the damage and disappointment I have left behind at home and at NBC.”  Although her PEOPLE interview is the first time Couric has spoken in detail about Lauer’s exit, she briefly broke her silence about the scandal on social media in December.  In a short response to an Instagram user, who called Couric out for not publicly addressing the scandal, the veteran journalist said, “It’s incredibly upsetting and I will say something when I’m ready to. Thanks for your interest.”  RELATED VIDEO: Women of Hollywood Attend Golden Globes Together in Support of the Time’s Up Movement  The claims against Lauer came as hundreds of women and men — including Rose McGowan, Ashley Judd, Terry Crews and Anthony Rapp — have publicly came forward about alleged sexual misconduct at the hands of powerful men in Hollywood, including Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey.  The movement inspired the new Time’s Up initiative and legal defense fund that was created to help victims of sexual misconduct pursue legal action against their perpetrators. Time’s Up was a major focus at this year’s Golden Globes, where almost all the famous attendees wore black to raise awareness about the cause.  “I think it was really moving to see so many women support each other and demand change, not only for themselves, but for mistreated and marginalized women in all kinds of industries,” Couric tells PEOPLE about Time’s Up. “Clearly we are witnessing a sea change and a long overdue course correction.”  She also said that one of the new of the episodes of her upcoming six-part documentary Nat Geo series will focus on harassment women have experienced in their workplaces.  “One of my Nat Geo episodes explores the various obstacles that are holding women back in Hollywood, Silicon Valley and beyond,” she says. “I just interviewed Elisabeth Moss about this.

But the male player ranked 701 in the world - Dmitry Tursunov - believes he could beat her.  Speaking to US radio station NPR, seven-time Grand Slam champion McEnroe said of former world number one Williams, who has won an Open-era record 23 Grand Slams: ""If she played the men's circuit she'd be, like, 700 in the world.""  He qualified the comments by saying: ""That doesn't mean I don't think Serena is an incredible player, and I suppose anything's possible; maybe at some point a women's tennis player can be better than anybody.""  But he added: ""I just haven't seen that in any other sport, and I haven't seen it in tennis. If she had to just play the men's circuit, it would be an entirely different story.""  Williams later responded on Twitter: ""Dear John, I adore and respect you but please please keep me out of your statements that are not factually based.  ""I've never played anyone ranked ""there"" nor do I have time. Respect me and my privacy as I'm trying to have a baby. Good day sir.""  Williams, 35, won her 23rd Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in January. It later transpired she was pregnant at the time  'She is pregnant, and I'm not'  Tursunov, 34, was once ranked as high as 20th in the world.  The Russian told BBC World Service Sport he did not think McEnroe was ""trying to talk women's tennis down"" but said ""the reality"" was that ""men are stronger in general"".  ""I would hope that I would win against Serena,"" he added.  ""It would be a similar argument to: who would run faster, the fastest woman or the fastest man? Tennis is becoming more and more a physical sport, so it's going to be hard for a woman to beat the men.  ""It's not black and white, there are lots of factors to take into account. Physically I might not be in the best shape of my life but as an overall package I'm much better than my ranking would suggest. She is pregnant, and I'm not.  ""I've never heard John say anything absolutely stupid - he knows his stuff. What he said about her being an incredible player is correct - explosive, powerful and she puts in a lot of work. But I would hope that I would win.""  Battle of the sexes  A crowd of 30,000 watched Billie Jean King take on Bobby Riggs in Houston in 1973  Tennis matches between men and women have occurred before, mostly notably back in 1973 when Billie Jean King took on fellow American Bobby Riggs.  Riggs, the world number one in the 1940s, retired in 1951 and at the age of 55 believed he could beat any of the top female players.  King originally declined to play Riggs and Australian Margaret Court - at the time the top female player in the world - stepped in. Riggs won 6-2 6-1.  But later that year, the top ranked women's player King - 26 years younger than Riggs at 29 - took him on in an exhibition match at the Houston Astrodome and won 6-4 6-3 6-3.  A third 'Battle of the Sexes' match took in 1992 between American former world number one Jimmy Connors, aged 40 at the time, and Czech and American Martina Navratilova, who was 35.  The match took place under special rules to make it more competitive - Connors was allowed only one serve per point, and Navratilova was allowed to hit into half the doubles court. Connors won 7-5 6-2.","Title: Serena Williams Responds to McEnroe's Remark, Says She's 'Beyond Ready' to Prove Her Worth
In a bold move, Serena Williams has hit back at John McEnroe's recent claim that she would struggle to be in the world's top 700 if she played on the men's circuit. Williams, who is widely regarded as one of the greatest tennis players of all time, expressed her disappointment and frustration with McEnroe's statement, saying that she is ""beyond ready"" to prove her worth on the men's circuit.
""I don't think it's fair or respectful to make assumptions about someone's abilities based on their gender,"" Williams said in a statement. ""I have worked tirelessly to hone my craft and be the best player I can be, and I will continue to do so. I'm beyond ready to show the world what I can do on the men's circuit.""
Williams' response comes after McEnroe made waves earlier this week when he claimed that Williams would not be able to compete at the same level as the men's top players, including Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal, if she were to switch circuits. McEnroe's comments sparked a heated debate about gender and athleticism, with many arguing that Williams' skills and achievements on the women's circuit should be enough to prove her worth on the men's circuit.
Despite the backlash, Williams remains unfazed and determined to prove her doubters wrong. ""I know I have what it takes to succeed on the men's circuit,"" she said. ""I'm excited to show everyone what I can do and prove my worth.""
The tennis world is eagerly awaiting Williams' next move, as she continues to break barriers and push the limits of what is possible in the sport. With her unwavering determination and unparalleled skill, it's clear that Serena Williams is a force to be reckoned with, both on the women's and men's circuits."

Brothers, James Stanford Poore, 32, and Cedric Dwayne Poore, 39, were arrested and booked on four complaints each of first degree murder, Chief Chuck Jordan said.  On Monday, January 7, 2013, twin sisters Rebeika Powell and Kayetie Powell-Melchor, 23; Misty Nunley, 33, and Julie Jackson, 55 were found shot in the head, with their hands tied behind their backs inside a south Tulsa apartment, police say. A 3-year-old boy was also found inside the apartment, unharmed.  Chief Jordan said the murders were not gang-related. According to arrest reports, witnesses told investigators that the brothers left an apartment in the same building at Fairmont Terrace Apartments, near 61st and Peoria, saying they were going to pull a ""lick"" at the victims' apartment.  Witnesses told police the brothers returned about 20 minutes later with a bag full of drugs, cash, and jewelry. According to the report, James Poore told the witnesses that he shot one of the victims because she could identify him and that Cedric shot the other three. The witnesses told investigators the brothers split the money and that Cedric Poore took the jewelry to pawn.    When he was interviewed Wednesday, James Poore confirmed to investigators that he knew one of the victims and that he was in the apartment where the witnesses placed him. Before invoking his right to remain silent, he told investigators he knew one of the victims had used and sold illegal drugs and that Cedric drove a black van to the apartment the day of the murders.    The arrest report shows Cedric Poore denied being in the apartment the day of the murders and refused to speak to investigators any more.  Chief Jordan said the brothers both stayed at Fairmont Terrace Apartments. The property manager there told News On 6 that neither of them are on a lease.  Cedric Poore has been in Tulsa County jail on a traffic violation since January 14, and James Poore was arrested Wednesday morning. Department of Corrections records show both James and Cedric have been previously convicted and incarcerated for robbery with a firearm.  Chief Jordan said more arrests may still be made.  Mayor Dewey Bartlett released a statement Wednesday afternoon, in response to the news of the arrests:    ""The Tulsa Police Department is known for their quick efforts of finding perpetrators and they indeed lived up to their stellar reputation for this case. I have the utmost confidence in Chief Chuck Jordan and the Tulsa Police Department and I knew they would bring in those involved with this hideous quadruple murder in very short order. Although a direct tip from the public cannot be identified as the catalyst that led to the arrests, tips are always important, which is part of great police work from our force.""","Title: Police Make Arrests in Fairmont Terrace Apartments Murders

This is a serious news piece that examines the 10-year-old reality show Keeping Up With The Kardashians and its emotional storylines. While many viewers may have dismissed the show as frivolous or superficial, a closer look reveals a series that tackles some heavy themes with sensitivity and depth.
At its core, Keeping Up With The Kardashians is a show about family dynamics and relationships. Over the years, viewers have watched as the Kardashian-Jenner clan has navigated personal struggles, including addiction, infidelity, and loss. These storylines are often deeply emotional and have resonated with audiences who can relate to the same challenges in their own lives.
One particularly poignant storyline from the show's recent seasons involves Kendall Jenner's struggle with anxiety and depression. In a heart-wrenching episode, Kendall opens up about her mental health struggles, revealing the intense pressure she feels to succeed in the fashion industry and the impact it has on her self-esteem. The scene is raw and unflinching, and it has sparked a much-needed conversation about mental health in the public eye.
Another emotional storyline involves Kim Kardashian West's journey with pregnancy and motherhood. Throughout the show's 10 seasons, viewers have watched as Kim has navigated the joys and challenges of pregnancy, childbirth, and raising her children. The show's portrayal of pregnancy and motherhood is refreshingly realistic, shattering the myth that pregnancy and childbirth are always easy and joyful.
While Keeping Up With The Kardashians may not be everyone's cup of tea, it has undoubtedly had a profound impact on popular culture. By tackling emotional storylines with sensitivity and depth, the show has shown that reality TV can be more than just a superficial look into the lives of the rich and famous. It can be a platform for exploring complex themes and issues that resonate with audiences around the world.
In conclusion, Keeping Up With The Kardashians may not be a show that everyone takes seriously, but it has proven to be more than just a guilty pleasure. With its emotional storylines and raw portrayals of family dynamics, it is a show that has left a lasting impact on popular culture."

Washington D.C. - As Donald Trump prepares to take the oath of office as the 45th president of the United States on Friday, the nation is abuzz with mixed emotions. While many Americans are eagerly awaiting the inauguration, others are choosing to tune out, citing concerns about the president-elect's controversial policies and divisive rhetoric.
According to a recent poll, 45% of Americans say they will be watching the inauguration on television, while 27% plan to attend the ceremony in person. However, 28% of respondents stated that they will not be watching or attending the event, with many citing frustration with Trump's inflammatory rhetoric and controversial stance on issues such as immigration and race.
""I can't stand to watch him be sworn in after everything he's said and done,"" said Sarah Johnson, a 32-year-old social worker from New York. ""I just don't feel like he represents the values of this country, and I don't want to give him the validation of watching his inauguration.""
Despite the mixed reactions, Trump's inauguration is expected to be a highly security-conscious event, with over 800,000 people expected to attend the ceremony and millions more tuning in on television. The event will feature a series of speeches and performances, including a keynote address by incoming First Lady Melania Trump.
As the nation prepares to embark on this new chapter in its history, many are left wondering what the future holds for the United States under President Trump. While some are optimistic about the potential for change and growth, others are more skeptical, citing concerns about the president-elect's unpredictable nature and the potential for his policies to exacerbate existing social and political tensions.
Regardless of one's opinion on the matter, it is clear that Donald Trump's inauguration will be a significant moment in American history, and one that will be closely watched and deeply felt by people around the world."

The country superstar opened up about his romance with the No Doubt frontwoman in a new interview with Billboard magazine.  As previously reported, Shelton told Stefani that he was splitting from Lambert during a meeting with their Voice coworkers. The “Misery” singer, who was new to the team at the time, got emotional.  “I won’t forget that day. I looked over at Gwen — who I didn’t really know — and she had these huge tears in her eyes. I thought, ‘Wow, she feels super bad for me!’” Shelton recalled. “She didn’t tell me much, because we didn’t know each other at the time, but she said, ‘I’m going through something very similar to what you’re going through. I understand. And I hate it.’”  Stefani was dealing with her own breakup at the time with Gavin Rossdale. (As Us Weekly exclusively revealed, the Bush rocker was cheating on her with their children’s nanny, Mindy Mann.) They announced they were ending their 13-year marriage in August 2015, one month after Shelton and Lambert announced they were divorcing after four years.  The “Came Here to Forget” singer and Stefani leaned on each other for support during the difficult time. The closer they got, the more Shelton saw Stefani in a new light.  “That’s kind of how our friendship and bond started, that day. It went from that, to checking in on each other once a week through email — ‘This s–t happened to me, what happened to you?’ — to maybe three times a week, then every day, to ‘Hey, here’s my phone number if you ever want to text,’” Shelton told Billboard. “Next thing I know, I wake up and she’s all I care about, and I’m ­wondering if she feels the same about me.”  “Gwen saved my life,” he added. “Who else on earth could understand going through a high-profile divorce from another musician? You can’t even imagine the similarities in our divorces.”  The two teamed up professionally too. Shelton included their collaborative track, “Go Ahead and Break My Heart,” on his 12th studio album, If I’m Honest.  “When we recorded the vocals for some of these songs, I was only six months removed from when all the crap went down,” Shelton said of his split from Lambert. “When you have a broken heart — at least, when I do — you got to get it out of your system. You want people to sympathize with you.

But I’m not forcing anything right now.”  As far as her relationship with the 42-year-old former Yankees player, she said: “It’s good, it’s healthy; we communicate well. We understand each other’s lives in a way that most other people couldn’t.”  She added: “We both entered the public eye in our early twenties and overachieved right from the start. And that affects every dynamic in your life, from your family to your work to your relationships. We have a similar makeup.”  The pair celebrated their anniversary in February in Minneapolis, where the singer performed a concert ahead of the Super Bowl. During the show, she debuted her single “Us” written by Poo Bear and produced by Skrillex, and dedicated it to Rodriguez, who was in the audience. “We’ve been together for one year today. I don’t want to get all mushy or anything, but baby, this song’s for you. I love you,” she told the athlete while on stage.  When talking about how she chose the song, Lopez told the magazine that the lyrics fit right into where the couple were in their relationship. She said: “They played me about 20 different songs, and when I heard this one I was like, ‘Oh, this is relevant!’ Alex and I were just getting to know each other. And I was like, ‘Oh, my God, could this be? Could this be us?’”  Lopez was previously married to chef Ojani Noa for nearly a year in 1997, and dancer Cris Judd from 2001 to 2002. She later married singer Marc Anthony in 2004 and they called it quits in 2011. The pair share 10-year-old twins Max and Emme. The former Yankees shortstop shares daughters Ella, 9, and Natasha, 13, with ex-wife Cynthia Scurtis. They split in 2008 after six years of marriage.  A lot has changed in the “Dance Again” songstress’ life since her last relationship, and she said a lot of it has to do with really knowing herself. “When I was younger I spent a lot of time being half happy and half not happy,” she told the publication. “I know who I am and what I want. I also know my strengths and weaknesses. It took me a long time to get to a point where I could say something nice about myself. I’m glad I can do that now.”  Lopez remains optimistic as she continues with her career, raise her two children and make her relationship with Rodriguez work for the long run. “Baseball is just like life,” she said. “All you want to do is hit a home run.”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!","Title: J-Lo's No Rush to Walk Down the Aisle with A-Rod

gossipcop-5658990975,1,0,"Daniel Craig is returning as James Bond once again, even as he reportedly fights to save his marriage to Rachel Weisz at the same time. Craig has already announced his intent to return as 007 in the franchise’s 25th film, and according to the National Enquirer, he’s still struggling to salvage what’s left of his marriage.  The Enquirer’s source claimed at the beginning of 2017, “Rachel and Daniel haven’t been happy for a while, and nearly called it quits last year.” The report claims that the married couple was in two separate filming locations at the beginning of the year, but continued to stay apart even after wrapping their respective films. The Enquirer then claims that they finally reunited in July after not being seen together in ‘554 days’.  According to the sources, the minute the outlet attempted to lock down an exclusive on the couple’s rocky marriage, both Rachel Weisz and Daniel Craig were seen arriving at New York’s Public Theater the next day, prompting the source to add, “The whole thing just seemed like too much of a coincidence. I don’t buy it for a minute.”  When you consider Daniel Craig’s own words, especially in the context of allegedly turning down a $150 million payday to star in two more James Bond films, he had stated, “Being on your own would be sad, sick, and weird. I don’t trust myself. I need that balance.” If these reports are to be believed, then Daniel Craig previously turned down starring in more Bond films to spend time with his family, but now – all of a sudden – he’s back to working on James Bond?  Either the report was never accurate to begin with, or he’s giving up on his marriage to Rachel Weisz. One would hope that the two have worked out whatever was troubling them in the first place, but given their own relationship and marriage histories – and how they’ve both jumped ship on long-term relationships at the drop of a hat – one wouldn’t be faulted for assuming that they are on their way to getting a divorce.  What do you guys think? Are Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz having marriage troubles, and is Daniel’s decision to take on the role of 007 again an indication that he’s giving up on his marriage? Or just a chance to have more career stability and/or cash in on a major paycheck? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.

LONDON - In a surprising turn of events, Daniel Craig has announced that he will once again don the iconic tuxedo and sunglasses to reprise his role as James Bond, despite rumors of marital troubles with actress Rachel Weisz.
According to sources close to the couple, Craig and Weisz have been struggling to keep their relationship afloat in recent months, with the actor reportedly fighting to save his marriage. However, despite these challenges, Craig has reportedly agreed to return as Bond for the upcoming installment of the franchise.
""Daniel is committed to his craft and to the Bond franchise,"" a source close to the actor told us. ""He knows how much the fans love him in the role, and he's not going to let personal issues get in the way of delivering an incredible performance.""
The news comes as no surprise, given Craig's previous statements about his love for the Bond character and the franchise. In a recent interview, the actor expressed his gratitude for the opportunity to play Bond, saying, ""It's been an incredible journey, and I feel truly blessed to have had the chance to be a part of it.""
Craig first took on the role of Bond in 2006's ""Casino Royale,"" and has since starred in ""Quantum of Solace"" (2008), ""Skyfall"" (2012), and ""Spectre"" (2015). The next Bond film is expected to begin production in the coming months, with a release date set for 2022.
While the news of Craig's return may come as a disappointment to fans of the franchise who were hoping for a change in leadership, it's clear that the actor is dedicated to his craft and to the Bond legacy. Only time will tell how Craig and Weisz will navigate their personal challenges while continuing to produce blockbuster hits for the Bond franchise."
gossipcop-4774142356,1,0,"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired.

In a remarkable display of artistic prowess and industry savvy, Jennifer Lopez has established herself as one of the most influential entertainers of the 2000s. By juggling successful careers in both music and film, Lopez has not only achieved unparalleled success but has also paved the way for other Latinas to follow in her footsteps.
Born in the Bronx to Puerto Rican parents, Lopez first made waves in the music industry with her debut album ""On the 6"" in 1999. The album's blend of pop, R&B, and Latin rhythms resonated with listeners worldwide, and Lopez quickly became a household name.
However, Lopez's impact goes beyond her music. With a string of successful films, including ""Selena"" (1997), ""Out of Sight"" (1998), and ""Maid in Manhattan"" (2002), Lopez has proven herself to be a versatile actress who can handle any role thrown her way. Her portrayal of Selena Quintanilla-Pérez in the former earned her a Golden Globe nomination and cemented her status as a Hollywood A-lister.
But Lopez's influence extends beyond the screen and the stage. As a role model and mentor to young Latinas, she has used her platform to promote diversity and inclusion in the entertainment industry. Through her production company, Nuyorican Productions, Lopez has provided opportunities for emerging Latino talent to break into the industry and has helped to increase the visibility of Latinos in media.
Lopez's groundbreaking career is a testament to the power of hard work, determination, and a little bit of talent. As she continues to defy expectations and push boundaries in the entertainment industry, it is clear that she will remain a force to be reckoned with for years to come."

Childhood pal Ninaki Priddy opened up about Prince Harry's fiancée, claiming her desire to be famous outweighed her commitment to her marriage to film producer Trevor Engelson.  Meghan married her ex back in 2011 on a Jamaican beach. They split two years later after she landed her role in Suits, which filmed in Toronto. Previously it was thought the pair grew apart after Meghan spent months filming in Canada and her beau was based in LA.  Ninaki says otherwise.  (Image: Getty Images North America)  (Image: REX/Shutterstock)  ""The way she handled it, Trevor definitely had the rug pulled out from under him. He was hurt,"" she said, explaining that while Trevor was heartbroken, Meghan was less affected,"" she told Mail Online.  Prior to their split, Ninaki - who was maid of honour at the wedding - said the pair doted on each other and Trevor would have done anything for the actress.  ""Then, after the wedding, it was like a light switched off. There’s Meghan before fame and Meghan after fame. After three seasons of Suits, she called me to say the marriage was over.  The pair first met aged two at Hollywood’s private Little Red School House before they went to the Immaculate Heart girls’ high school in Los Angeles at the age of 11.  Following a close friendship that she describes as 'sisterly', Ninaki says the pair eventually fell out over how Meghan and ex-husband - who the ex Suits star met when she was just 23 - split.  She explains she went to visit Trevor who was heartbroken over their split, while Meghan seemed less affected.

""We used to imagine her receiving an Oscar. She used to practise announcing herself.""  While talking about her relationship with Harry and her role as a future royal, Ninaki claims Meghan was always very aware of the Royal Family - despite the actress claiming she knew little about Harry when they met.  ""I think it’s a very fanciful dream to believe that you just walk into a Prince Charming.  ""I know the Royal Family was something she found fascinating. She had one of Princess Diana’s books [Diana: Her True Story] on her bookshelf, and even when she was with Trevor she told me she wanted to go and stay in London for at least a month.""  She added: ""I wasn’t shocked or even surprised to hear about Prince Harry. I know she used to love The Princess Diaries — films about a commoner who becomes part of a Royal Family. She was very taken with that idea.""","In a shocking revelation, Jessica Steinmetz told Daily Star Online that Prince Harry's wife had been struggling with mental health issues for years and it was the main reason why she divorced her husband, Trevor Engelson. According to Steinmetz, Markle had been battling depression and anxiety since her early 20s and it was taking a toll on her marriage. Despite the efforts of her husband and friends to help her, Markle found it difficult to overcome her struggles and eventually called off the marriage. Steinmetz claims that Markle's mental health issues were the primary reason for the split and that she is still struggling to cope with the demands of royal life. The news comes as a shock to many, as Markle has always been open about her struggles with mental health and her commitment to raising awareness about the issue. The Duchess of Sussex has been an outspoken advocate for mental health and has used her platform to encourage others to seek help when they need it. In a statement, a spokesperson for Markle declined to comment on the matter, citing her privacy. However, sources close to the royal family have confirmed that Markle has been receiving professional help for her mental health issues and is taking steps to manage her condition. The news of Markle's mental health struggles comes at a time when the royal family is facing increased scrutiny over their mental health. Prince William has been open about his own struggles with mental health and has used his platform to encourage others to seek help. The royal family has also taken steps to address the issue, including launching a mental health initiative earlier this year. The revelation about Markle's mental health issues is likely to reignite the debate about the pressures of royal life and the need for greater support for those struggling with mental health.

gossipcop-1551062653,1,0,"  George Clooney and his wife, Amal, attend the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. (Alberto Pizzoli/AFP via Getty Images)  Once the ultimate bachelor — and two-time People’s Sexiest Man Alive cover model — George Clooney entered entirely new territory this week.  The Oscar-winning actor and his human-rights-lawyer wife of two years, Amal, announced Tuesday that they are the proud new parents of twins, Ella and Alexander.  Clooney has donned many hats in his life — actor, director, producer and activist, but fatherhood had always seemed far away. Was it the early-onset-salt-and-pepper hair? The coterie of models who found themselves on his arm for fleeting moments over the years? The insistence by tabloids and fellow co-stars that it was time for him to settle down? Maybe. Or perhaps it was the simple fact that Clooney himself said again and again that he would not reproduce. In several interviews. Many, many times. For many, many years.  A first-time father at 56, Clooney was often asked throughout his career whether the single life was his ultimate future. But after proposing marriage to Amal in April 2014 and marrying her that September (as well as sharing wedding photos with People magazine in the United States and Hello magazine in Britain), it seemed as if anything was possible for the man who once said, “I don’t see myself ever having kids.”  But it was a long road to get there. “I don’t have that gene that people have to replicate,” he told People in 2006.  When Esquire asked him why he wasn’t married with kids, he replied, “I haven’t had aspirations in that way, ever.” And as for people who thought it was weird that a man in his 50s was single and childless? “What do you do? Should I go, ‘I got to get me some kids right now!’ and rush out and impregnate someone?”  Clooney seemed to express frustration when asked how he could ever relate to the fathers he occasionally portrays onscreen. His answer: “Well, I’m also not running for president, but I played that role in ‘Ides of March.’ I wasn’t an actual lawyer when I did ‘Michael Clayton,’ and I don’t fire people for a living like I did in ‘Up in the Air.’ ”  “I keep saying I’ll never get married again or have children but people just don’t want to believe me,” Clooney told Britain’s Daily Express just three months before popping the question to his now-wife.  Of course, celebrities are people, too, and it shouldn’t surprise anyone that a man might change his mind around the midcentury mark. And Clooney is certainly not alone in choosing to wait till later in life to welcome a child into the family: Comedian Steve Martin became a father at age 67 in 2012; Elton John was 63 when he had a baby via a surrogate in 2010; and Chris Noth was 53 when he welcomed his only child in 2008.  Perhaps it’s the fact that Clooney always seemed so delightfully and devilishly Clooney-ish that made his bachelordom seem like the only constant in our ever-changing popular culture. But we can rest easy knowing that despite some hesitation about having a family over the years, his sense of humor has remained steady throughout.  “Ella, Alexander and Amal are all healthy, happy and doing fine,” the statement announcing the birth of the twins read. “George is sedated and should recover in a few days.”","The actor, now 55, married lawyer Amal Alamuddin in 2014, and the two have been living happily ever after. Or, at least, that’s what it appears. Clooney and his new wife made their first red-carpet appearance together at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival, where they walked the carpet for the premiere of his latest film, “Money Monster.” The two looked every bit the Hollywood power couple, with Clooney handing his wife flowers and giving her a kiss on the cheek as they posed for photos.
But is this newfound commitment to marriage just a ruse? Some insiders say not. According to a source close to the couple, “George and Amal are truly in love and are committed to making their marriage work. They’re taking things slow and steady, but they’re both all in.” So, it seems that the days of Clooney’s carefree bachelor lifestyle may be behind him, at least for now. But hey, with a gorgeous wife like Amal by his side, who needs a Playboy mansion anyway?"

""I wasn't necessarily nervous about this album,"" Swift said. ""I think my label might have been a little nervous but they'll never say it now.""  Swift, whose roots were initially planted in country music, is now going full-steam ahead into Top 40 fare with 1989.  ""I knew I wanted to change the way I did things creatively,"" Swift told the View co-hosts. ""I knew I wanted to keep people on their toes. I didn't want anyone to have their feelings hurt by me changing directions creatively, because that's never the intention.""  With lyrics about empowerment and ridding one's self of negativity, Swift is once again being lauded as a feminist for a younger generation.  ""It's interesting how feminism has come up in conversation so much more in the last year,"" Swift said. ""I was never really taught the definition of feminism when I was a little girl and I wish I had been.""

Wiig, who is mostly known for her comedy chops, would be the adversary to Gal Gadot’s Diana Prince. This time the superhero has skipped ahead in time from World War II to fight crime in the 1980s. Cheetah, who was originally depicted as the alter ego of a socialite, will probably fit right in with Reagan’s America. Though, then again, since this is the Cold War she could suddenly become a Soviet. Patty Jenkins is also returning as the film’s director.","Here is the news piece:
Washington D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, it has been confirmed that Kristen Wiig is in the running to play the iconic DC Comics villain, Cheetah, in the highly anticipated Wonder Woman sequel. According to Deadline, the Bridesmaids star is one of several actresses being considered for the role, which was most recently portrayed by actress Cathy Lee Crosby in the 1975 TV movie.
The casting of Wiig, known for her hilarious comedic roles in films like Bridesmaids and Saturday Night Live, marks a bold departure for the franchise, which has so far featured primarily female leads. However, insiders say that the filmmakers are eager to explore the darker, more complex side of the DC Universe, and believe that Wiig's unique talent and versatility make her the perfect choice for the role of Cheetah.
""Kristen Wiig is an incredibly talented actress who has proven herself time and time again in both comedy and drama,"" said Patty Jenkins, director of Wonder Woman and the upcoming sequel. ""We are excited to see her bring this iconic villain to life in a way that is both true to the character and fresh and unexpected.""
Wiig herself has remained tight-lipped about the role, but sources close to the production say that she is ""thrilled"" at the opportunity to join the Wonder Woman franchise and bring Cheetah to the big screen in a new and exciting way.
The news of Wiig's potential casting comes as no surprise to fans of the actress, who have been clamoring for more comic-book roles for her since her breakout performance in Bridesmaids. With her unique blend of humor and dramatic chops, Wiig is sure to bring a new level of excitement and energy to the role of Cheetah, and fans of the franchise are eagerly anticipating her take on the character.

The actor appears on the September cover of GQ where he explained why he chooses to stay very quiet when it comes to his private life.  “I always think the risk reward is very much weighted in the wrong direction,” Pattinson, 31, said of opening up in interviews. “If I could stay silent, I would.”  Pattinson has been dating singer F.K.A. Twigs since 2014, and recently told Howard Stern they were “kind of” engaged. But when asked by GQ if he was getting married, the actor — who revealed he calls his girlfriend Twigs — responded with a noncommittal “eh.”  Daniel Jackson/GQ  Pattinson said that he went to therapy a few years ago – and his therapist commented that he was good at “talking without saying anything.” He said he uses that skill in all his interviews. The Good Time actor explained that he chooses to stay private so people don’t form ideas about his personality that may later change and label him as dishonest.  RELATED: Celeb Quotes of the Day: Jennifer Lawrence, Emma Stone & More  “I want to be misunderstood,” he told the magazine after declining to talk about anything personal. “People are always changing, and the more you put something down in print, people form opinions and they’re constantly creating who they think you are.

He would also try to confuse photographers by having all of his friends order different rides out of restaurants when they were together and sending the cars to different places after trading outfits with one of his friends. Pattinson also recalled riding in trunks several times to hide from the photographers – and once drove around all night when one was tailing him to find out where his new house is.  “There are ways to disappear, like, fairly easily,” he said. “It just involves effort, and most people can’t be bothered to put the effort in.”  Good Time hits theaters August 11.","Here is the news piece I came up with:

However, Pattinson has now revealed that he is tired of the constant attention and has decided to prioritize his privacy above all else.
""I just feel like I've been kind of...overexposed for a long time,"" Pattinson told GQ. ""It's hard to remember what it's like to just be a normal person when you're constantly being asked to be someone else.""

gossipcop-7658353025,1,0,"“A Star Is Born” is that thing we always yearn for but so rarely get to see: a transcendent Hollywood movie. It’s the fourth remake of a story that dates back to 1932, but this one has a look and vibe all its own — rapturous and swooning, but also delicate and intimate and luminous. It’s set in the present day, but in spirit it’s a sophisticated retro ’70s drama built around the uncanny flow of feeling that develops between the movie’s two stars: Bradley Cooper, who plays Jackson Maine, a hard-drinking, bad-ol’-boy redneck rock ‘n’ roller who is still hanging on as a popular attraction but has lost the lust for what he’s doing, and Lady Gaga, in her fetching and accomplished movie-star debut, as Ally, an ingenuous, fresh-faced singer-songwriter who becomes his lover and stage partner before rocketing on her own into the new pop stratosphere. She takes off as he slowly crashes — that’s the soapy tragic “Star Is Born” concept. But what the movie does is to take this fabled melodramatic romantic seesaw and turn it into something indelibly heartfelt and revealing. Cooper directed the movie himself, working from a script he co-wrote with Eric Roth and Will Fetters, and to say that he does a good job would be to understate his accomplishment. As a filmmaker, Bradley Cooper gets right onto the high wire, staging scenes that take their time and play out with a shaggy intimacy that’s shorn of the usual “beats.” The new “Star Is Born” is a total emotional knockout, but it’s also a movie that gets you to believe, at every step, in the complicated rapture of the story it’s telling. More Reviews Venice Film review: 'Isis, Tomorrow. The Lost Souls of Mosul' Telluride Film Review: 'They'll Love Me When I'm Dead' The 1976 version, starring Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson, had some terrific cornball love songs, but they didn’t belong anywhere near the stadium-rock stage, and neither did Streisand, which is part of why the movie came off as borderline ludicrous. It seemed stranded, with a kind of campy sincere ineptitude, between three worlds: Old Hollywood, New Hollywood, and Barbra Streisand rock-princess fantasy. But from the electrifying opening moments of the new version, in which Jackson, boozy and raw, with his sunburned squint and hard-bitten shit-kicker sexiness, takes the stage of a gigantic stadium and launches into a grinding slow rocker that sounds like “Victim of Love”-era Eagles as done by the Allman Brothers, the movie is thrillingly authentic. That’s no minor accomplishment. Hollywood almost never succeeds in nailing the rock world, but “A Star Is Born,” though a love story through and through, is the most lived-in rock ‘n’ roll movie since “Almost Famous.” And that absolute looks right, sounds right, feels right verisimilitude sets the stage for everything that follows. Jackson, who looks to be in his mid-40s, has been around long enough that he now occupies a grey zone between legend and nostalgia. He can still fill an arena full of screaming fans, and his old hits have become classic-rock chestnuts, but his sound and persona have long slipped out of the zeitgeist. His whole outlaw look — the beard and rancher’s hat, the Kristofferson-meets-Skynyrd soused macho twinkle — mark him as a charismatic relic, and the grand irony is this: What that look, and sound, are all about is an era when rock ‘n’ roll strutted its “authenticity,” but now that he’s out of date, Jackson’s authenticity looks more than ever like a showbiz conceit, frozen in amber. It’s a part he’s playing, an image he’s working — and secretly struggling — to keep alive. He’s got a signature ballad that goes “Maybe it’s time to let the old ways die,” and when he wrote it (long ago), he probably didn’t know that he was talking about himself. In the first of many telling jump cuts, the film leaps from his on-stage glory to Jackson slinking into the back of his car, weary and alone, grabbing the bottle of gin he’s got stashed there. He takes a guzzle, and Coop","Title: ""A Star Is Born: A Transcendent Hollywood Movie""

Date: March 12, 2023
In a shocking turn of events, Taylor Swift has been enjoying an unparalleled level of happiness, thanks to her decision to keep her personal life under wraps. According to sources close to the pop star, the 33-year-old singer has been thriving since she stopped sharing every detail of her life on social media and in interviews.
""Taylor has been incredibly happy lately, and we couldn't be happier for her,"" a spokesperson for Swift told Us Weekly in a statement. ""She's finally found a balance between her personal and professional life, and it's paying off in a big way.""
The decision to keep her personal life private is a departure from Swift's past habits, when she frequently shared every aspect of her life with her fans on social media. But since she started dating actor Joe Alwyn in 2017, Swift has been more selective about what she shares online, and it seems to have made all the difference.
""Taylor has always been very open with her fans, but she's realized that her happiness is more important than satisfying their curiosity,"" the spokesperson explained. ""She's found that by keeping her personal life private, she's able to focus on her music and her well-being without the constant scrutiny.""
And it's working. Swift's latest album, ""Fearless,"" has been a commercial success, and critics are raving about her new sound and lyrics. Fans are also noticing a positive change in the singer's attitude and energy, which they attribute to her newfound happiness.
""Taylor's been killing it lately,"" said fan Emily Johnson. ""Her music is better than ever, and she seems so much more relaxed and confident. I'm so glad she's found a way to balance her personal and professional life.""
As Swift continues to thrive in her private life, fans and industry insiders alike are breathing a collective sigh of relief. It seems that keeping her personal life private has been the key to unlocking Swift's true happiness and potential. And as she continues to make music and inspire her fans, it's clear that this new chapter in her life is only just beginning."

Years later, Brad regrets leaving the Friends star for his now-ex Angelina Jolie, a source told In Touch exclusively.  Following his 2016 separation from Angie, Brad sobered up and sought therapy. And now, he’s “in touch with emotions and his true self like never before,” the source says.  Brad Pitt finally opens up about his bitter divorce with Angelina Jolie  And it seems like this self-awareness comes with some great realisations. “He has come to realise that leaving Jen for Angelina was one of the biggest mistakes of his life,” the source adds. “And while he’s not in love with Jen, he realises how much he does love her. Brad keeps telling friends that he’s seeing everything more clearly.”  However, these realisations are obviously far too late. Jennifer has been married to Wanderlust co-star Justin Theroux for two years now.  And while Brad would “never dream of” ruining his ex’s new marriage, he “would take a second chance at love with Jen in a heartbeat.”  If they can’t be romantic partners, though, the War Machine star wants Jen to be his partner in other pursuits, In Touch further reported.  Brad Pitt “much happier” following split from Angelina Jolie  “They worked well together” when they formed the production company Plan B in 2001, an insider close to Brad told In Touch. “He wants Jen involved again as he produces and develops more and more high-quality film and cable TV products.”  That kind of professional partnership could pay off for Jen, too, since the insider states she wants in on “prestige projects” under his production banner. “She’d be beyond thrilled to win an Academy Award for Best Actress — something that’s evaded both her and Angelina.”  “He still considers Jen the love of his life,” the source concluded.

It is hard to imagine a My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy — one of the greatest rap albums of all time — without an “Imma let you finish” at the 2009 VMAs.  His new album, ye, doesn’t merit any similar mercy.  On first listen, it doesn’t sound like any part of ye was recorded pre-MAGA hat picture, which blows a Kanye-head sized hole through the argument that the previous month’s behavior was a publicity stunt to promote the album. If anything, the album seems like an meek afterthought to the Twitter tirade and dive into right-wing politics. Most of it deals with the repercussions of the storm which came before it, and for the first time in his career, the artist’s personality is overwhelming the art.  The opening track ‘I Thought About Killing You’, if played in a vacuum, sounds like the work of a troubled mind. If a poem like this came from a loved one, it would surely merit discussion about a trip to the therapist. Kanye goes on to deliver cringe-worthy rhymes on issues ranging from Russell Simmons rape allegations to his petrification on realizing that his daughter might one day look like his wife.

Title: Kanye's Capriciousness: A Legacy of Creativity and Controversy
In a shocking turn of events, a recent study has revealed that Kanye West's notorious capriciousness may be the key to his unparalleled success in the music industry. The study, conducted by music scholars at Harvard University, found that West's tendency to be unpredictable and outspoken has not only earned him a reputation for being difficult to work with, but has also fueled his creativity and propelled him to the top of his field.
The study cites West's infamous interruption of Taylor Swift's acceptance speech at the 2009 VMAs as a prime example of his willingness to take risks and challenge the status quo. ""In that moment, West was not only expressing his own artistic vision, but also challenging the very notion of what is acceptable in mainstream culture,"" said Dr. Maria Jackson, lead author of the study. ""It is this willingness to push boundaries that has allowed West to create music that is both innovative and relevant.""
The study also notes that West's capriciousness has been repeatedly forgiven and, at times, belatedly rewarded with accolades. ""West's ability to generate controversy and spark conversation has proven to be a powerful tool in his career,"" said Dr. Jackson. ""His willingness to take risks and challenge the norm has earned him a loyal following and critical acclaim, even when his actions have been met with criticism.""
The study's findings are consistent with West's own statements about his creative process. In a recent interview, West said, ""I'm not afraid to be controversial. I'm not afraid to take risks. I'm not afraid to be myself."" It is clear that West's capriciousness is not only a product of his personality, but also a key factor in his success as an artist.
In conclusion, Kanye West's capriciousness is a double-edged sword. While it has earned him a reputation for being difficult to work with, it has also fueled his creativity and propelled him to the top of his field. As the study demonstrates, West's willingness to take risks and challenge the status quo has proven to be a powerful tool in his career, and it is likely that his capriciousness will continue to be a defining characteristic of his work in the years to come."

gossipcop-1716370499,1,1,"Dakota Johnson; most of us know her as the actress from Fifty Shades of Grey. While we may have seen Johnson in some pretty intimate positions on-screen, there’s definitely a lot we don’t know about the Fifty Shades star. Like, for instance, the superfluity of familiar names in her family tree. Seeing that her popular movie, Fifty Shades Darker came out on the day of love—Valentine's Day—it's only fitting to dedicate a piece to the actress who brought us the sexy and quaint, Anastasia Steele. Johnson, after all, has become somewhat something of a Valentine’s Day staple, herself. Here are 15 facts about Dakota Johnson or, as some might call her, ""that girl from Fifty Shades of Grey."" We guarantee that she will no longer by ""that girl"" by the end of the list! 15 Her Family Tree Is Full Of Famous Faces You know how we said there are a few familiar names in her family tree? Well, we weren’t lying. Her parents are fellow actors, Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson. Unfortunately, her parents divorced in 1994 so Dakota had to split her time between the two. ""It was the only way that I could be with them,"" she said in an interview for Cosmopolitan. ""And since they were divorced, I would spend two weeks with one and two weeks with the other, traveling with a tutor."" But wait, it gets better. Her maternal grandmother (can you guess..) is Hitchcock actress Tippi Hedren. Yes, that’s right, so clearly creative talent lies in that family. We’ve never heard of a family tree with so many famous names! Thanksgiving is probably a whirlwind. Now, Dakota Johnson is another famous name in that tree. 14 She’s An Animal Rights Activist advertising Just like her grandmother Tippi Hedren, Dakota Johnson is also an animal rights activist. Like grandmother, like granddaughter shall we say? As animal lovers ourselves, we’re pleased to hear that she’s following in her grandmother’s footsteps—both in acting and in animal rights. In 2014, Johnson saved 12 horses from being slaughtered by paying for them. What a sweet thing to do! We bet her grandmother was really proud. It’s always so great to hear about celebrities doing positive things - so naturally, we’re happy to hear of Dakota’s compassionate side. We admit we have a soft spot for animal lovers, but who doesn't? We always love hearing about people doing good deeds for animals and it’s always nice to hear celebrities using their celebrity title for the better. 13 She Grew Up Shooting Guns And Riding Horses In Colorado She may play the innocent and naive Anastasia Steele in the Fifty Shades movies, but growing up Johnson was anything but naive. She grew up in Colorado at her dad’s house, where she learned to build a fire, ride a horse, ride motorbikes, and even shoot a gun. And this was all before she was just 10 years old! Sounds like a badass kid to us! But when she wasn’t at her father’s house, she was at her mom’s house in L.A. which she also loved. It's hard to imagine a 10 year old these days shooting guns, riding motorbikes, or building fires without being grounded. But it sounds like she had a pretty inspiring and freeing childhood which makes us fall for the actress all the more. 12 She Never Dates advertising By the header, we mean she never has casual relationships. She only has long-term relationships. Good for her, is all we can say! You hear of so many celebrities who are constantly dating other celebrities. You can barely keep up with who they’re dating these days. It seems to be one guy or girl after another. So it’s great to hear of Dakota’s conservative views on relationships. Apparently she’s only ever been in long-term, serious relationships; she doesn’t just date. That probably explains why she’s been in a relationship with model Matthew Hitt since 2014. Yes, it’s been a kind of an on-and-off relationship but they’ve been in it for the long haul so far. So, to sum up, we like her whole dating attitude. The commitment is great and saves you a lot of time. 11 She HATED School It seems l","Subject: Dakota Johnson; New Details Emerge on Her Private Life
Date: March 22, 2023
In a shocking turn of events, new details have emerged on the private life of Hollywood actress Dakota Johnson, best known for her role as Anastasia Steele in the Fifty Shades franchise. While Johnson has been open about her personal life in interviews and public appearances, a new report from a reputable source reveals that the star has been keeping some aspects of her personal life shrouded in secrecy.
According to insiders close to the actress, Johnson has been dating a mysterious new beau for several months now. The identity of her suitor remains unknown, as Johnson has allegedly taken great pains to keep him out of the public eye.
“Dakota has been incredibly careful about who she lets into her personal life,” a source close to the actress revealed. “She’s been dating someone for a while now, but she’s been very selective about who knows about it.”
The report also claims that Johnson has been spending more and more time away from Los Angeles, where she has lived for most of her adult life. The actress has been seen frequenting various locations around the world, including Paris, Rome, and even a remote island in the Caribbean.
While Johnson’s representatives have not confirmed the report, insiders say that the actress is “absolutely thrilled” with her new relationship. “She’s been through a lot in the past few years, and she deserves some happiness,” the source added.
The news comes as a surprise to many fans of Johnson, who have followed her career closely since her breakout role in the 2014 film The Fault in Our Stars. Johnson’s portrayal of Anastasia Steele in the Fifty Shades franchise cemented her status as a Hollywood A-lister, and her subsequent roles in films like Suspiria and The Social Dilemma have only further solidified her position in the industry.
As Johnson continues to navigate her personal and professional life, one thing is clear: the actress is determined to keep her privacy intact, even as she shares more of herself with the world. Whether or not Johnson will continue to share details of her private life with the public remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the actress is a woman of mystery, and she’s not about to give up her secrets anytime soon."

LOS ANGELES - In a shocking turn of events, the popular television series ""Fetch"" has been experiencing technical difficulties, leaving fans in a state of panic. According to the show's producers, the last successful fetch of the series was on June 11, 2018, at 3:37 AM.
""We are deeply sorry for the inconvenience this has caused our loyal viewers,"" said a spokesperson for the show. ""We are working around the clock to resolve the issue and bring new episodes to our fans as soon as possible.""
Fans of the show have taken to social media to express their frustration and disappointment, with many calling for the show to be cancelled if the technical difficulties persist.
""I can't believe this is happening,"" said one fan. ""I've been waiting for new episodes of 'Fetch' for months, and now I'm left with nothing. It's just not fair.""
Despite the setback, the show's producers remain optimistic about the future of the series.
""We understand the disappointment of our fans, but we are confident that we will be able to resolve this issue and bring new episodes of 'Fetch' to them soon,"" said the spokesperson. ""We appreciate their patience and support during this time.""
In the meantime, fans of the show are left to speculate about what may have caused the technical difficulties and when new episodes will be available. One thing is certain, however: the wait for ""Fetch"" will be a long and difficult one."
gossipcop-9811720113,1,0,"I, at least, struggle to understand her career. Her performance as a junkie in “The Town” features the “Bride Wars” of Boston accents. Her performance in “The Age of Adaline” — as a woman “cursed” to stay 30 forever — was like watching a mermaid ride a bike. She tries. But her acting hasn’t yet caught up to her algorithm-generated beauty. Alas, there may be no algorithmic solution for that.  So I was less than psyched at the prospect of seeing her shiver on a buoy, stitch her own wounds, talk to animals or play a Nancy. And, as refreshing as it is watching her stand on a surfboard, it’s refreshment that provides some perspective. While some actors make sense on movie screens, there are others who might make better sense on a can of something — beer, beans, air. I can hear you, Hudson skeptics. And all I can say is that the heart wants what the heart wants. I’d actually buy whatever Ms. Hudson was on the can of.  There might be no appreciable industrial difference between what a Kate Hudson can do versus your Blake Livelys. I don’t think they’re interchangeable, but sometimes the movies beg to differ, and the market corrects itself. Don’t fall in love with Mark Harmon, because here comes Kevin Costner. And sell your Brad Rowe stock, because he’s just going to be replaced by Brad Pitt. (In the late 1990s, that pretty much happened.) But there are continuums, too. Channing Tatum, for instance, is a more elastic, hip-hop-era Brendan Fraser upgrade.  Lots of parts that have gone to Ms. Lively feel as if Ms. Hudson could have played them. But something happened, and suddenly it was someone else’s turn to be “it.” (It’s always someone else’s turn.) And part of what annoys me about the lack of Kate Hudson in my life and the surfeit of Ms. Lively is the same thing that makes me angry when a perfectly good piece of software gets a superfluous update, or a zealous waiter takes my plate at a restaurant: I wasn’t done with that.","Title: Boston Actress's Performance Divides Critics

Boston, MA - The latest performance by local actress, Sarah Johnson, has left critics divided over her portrayal of a junkie in the new film ""The Town."" While some have praised her raw and emotional delivery, others have criticized her Boston accent, which some argue is over-the-top and cartoonish.
""I, for one, struggle to understand her career,"" said local film critic, Tom Smith. ""Her performance as a junkie in 'The Town' is like watching 'Bride Wars' with a Boston accent. It's just not convincing.""
Johnson, who is known for her versatility as an actress, has faced criticism for her portrayal of the troubled character. Some have accused her of overacting and exaggerating the Boston accent to the point of caricature.
""I understand that the character is meant to be a stereotype, but it's hard to take her seriously when she's mugging for the camera with such a ridiculous accent,"" said another critic, Emily Johnson.
Despite the criticism, Johnson remains defiant, insisting that she was trying to bring attention to the real-life struggles of addicts in Boston.
""I'm not trying to win any awards for my acting, I just want to raise awareness about the problem of drug addiction in our city,"" she said in a statement.
The controversy has sparked a heated debate in Boston's acting community, with some defending Johnson's performance as a necessary critique of the city's drug culture, while others argue that it is offensive and stereotypical.
Regardless of the debate, one thing is clear: Sarah Johnson's performance in ""The Town"" has generated a lot of buzz, and she is sure to be a topic of discussion in Boston's acting circles for some time to come."

gossipcop-6722352082,1,0,"Carlotta is a fictional character from Gaston Leroux's 1909 novel The Phantom of the Opera.  In the novel, she is a minor character hailing from Spain. The first time that she is mentioned in the novel is during the chapter ""The New Marguerite"", where it is revealed that she could not perform at the ceremony for the former managers. Later in the novel, she is threatened by Erik that if she performs at the Opera House ""a great misfortune will strike"". She shrugs the warning off and performs anyway. When she does, however, croaking noises come out of her mouth and the chandelier comes crashing down. Ashamed, she hides from the public view for a few weeks, before making a return to the opera house.  Carlotta is portrayed by Virginia Pearson in the original 1925 silent film with Lon Chaney. In 1929, new sound scenes were filmed and Mary Fabian was recast as Carlotta, due to the fact that she could sing. Virginia Pearson still appeared in new scenes, now playing Carlotta's mother. These changes are also the same in the 1929 silent, foreign cut of the film (which is most commonly viewed).  In the 1943 film version, she is Mme. Biancarolli who has been drugged by the Phantom and murdered along with her maid when she tries to force him to take off his prop mask.  In Andrew Lloyd Webber's production, Carlotta (last name Giudicelli) is from Italy and is one of the major singing parts. The opera company's prima donna, she despises Christine Daaé and sees the younger woman as a threat to her job and Phantom´s courtesan, when Christine achieves prominence due to the Phantom's dirty tricks. Carlotta and tenor Ubaldo Piangi are lovers; she often turns to him for consolation when things go wrong, and she breaks down crying when his murdered body is discovered onstage. The film reveals that she likes poodles.  In the Lloyd Webber-Joel Schumacher 2004 film version, she was played by Minnie Driver.[1] Due to Driver's lack of experience in opera, her singing voice was dubbed by opera singer Margaret Preece, although she lent her actual voice to the song ""Learn to Be Lonely"" during the end credits.  In Nicholas Meyer's novel The Canary Trainer, the characters of Carlotta and La Sorelli are combined into one, despite being mentioned as separate characters in the original novel. In Kim Newman's short story ""Angels of Music"" from the Tales of the Shadowmen anthology series, Carlotta is implied to be the ancestor of Bianca Castafiore from The Adventures of Tintin comic series.",She works as a ballet dancer at the Paris Opera House and has a crush on the Phantom.
gossipcop-178000221,1,0,"Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge wasn’t always a royal, but even before her marriage to Prince William, Kate Middleton had an impressive net worth.  Middleton had a comfortable upbringing before she became the first commoner to join the royal family after she married William in 2011. But Middleton’s net worth ballooned once she became a duchess.  Here’s everything we know about Middleton’s net worth:  What is Kate Middleton’s net worth?  The 36 year-old mother of three — who gave birth to a second baby boy in April — is worth at least £5 million, or $7 million, according to global wealth-tracking firm Wealth-X, though some estimates put her net worth as high as £7.3 million, or $10 million. Middleton’s wealth is mostly in cash because she doesn’t have a personal portfolio of property or artwork.  That being said, Middleton’s net worth is a lot less than her prince — Wealth-X estimates Prince William’s net worth is at least $30 million, though some reports put his fortune closer to $40 million. According to Wealth-X, $19 million of Prince William’s wealth is in cash. The wealth tracking firm also noted that William has an expensive helicopter fit for a royal — an Augusta A109S Grand helicopter which is valued at $11 million.  Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, Prince George of Cambridge and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge arrive for a children's party for Military families during the Royal Tour of Canada on September 29, 2016 in Victoria, Canada. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  What do we know about Kate Middleton’s money?  Most of Middleton’s net worth stems from Party Pieces, an online party supplies business started by her parents. The company is estimated to be worth around £30 million, or $50 million, thanks in no small part to the exposure it gets from being associated with the royals, according to royal expert Marlene Koenig.  Prior to her life as a full-time duchess, Middleton worked for the family business and was a part-time accessories buyer for a retailer called Jigsaw.  Growing up, Kate and her two siblings, Pippa and James Middleton, attended expensive privates schools from a young age, with years of tuition for just one child estimated to be at least £250,000, or $350,000. Kate met Prince William while in college in Scotland at the prestigious University of St. Andrew’s. She graduated in 2005 with a degree in Art History.  How did Kate Middleton’s net worth change after marrying Prince William?  Joining the royal family meant that Middleton was marrying into an incredible $88 billion fortune amassed over generations.  Before Will and Kate became the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and moved into a 20-room apartment in Kensington Palace, Kate lived in an apartment purchased by her parents in the Chelsea neighborhood of London believed to be worth £1 million, or $1.4 million.  Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge smile following their marriage at Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011 in London, England. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  But once Kate officially became a royal she didn’t need to spend much of her own money anymore. Most of her living costs are covered by the private estate Prince Charles manages, the Duchy of Cornwall. The revenue from the Duchy of Cornwall pays for the most of Prince Charles and his family’s royal expenses: things like official travel, wardrobe, housing and staff costs. When Meghan Markle marries Prince Harry on May 19, she too, will get to keep most of her own money — her net worth is believed to be about $5 million — as the Duchy of Cornwall will also absorb the majority of her living costs associated with royal responsibilities.  What is the ‘Kate effect’?  As the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate sets fashion trends all over the world. While she herself does not retain any income from the flurry of economic activity set off by the designer clothes she wears for public appearances, she has triggered what is known as “the Kate Effect,” ","Title: Kate Middleton's Pre-Royal Wealth Revealed
In a shocking revelation, it has been discovered that Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, wasn't always a member of the royal family. According to sources close to the matter, Kate Middleton, now the Duchess, had an impressive net worth even before her marriage to Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge.
The news has left many in shock, as the public has long been fascinated by the Cambridge's fairytale romance and their meteoric rise to royal prominence. However, it appears that Kate Middleton's wealth and status were not solely the result of her marriage to Prince William.
According to reports, Middleton's net worth was estimated to be in the millions of pounds before she met the Prince. Her pre-royal wealth is believed to have come from her family's successful business ventures, including a popular fashion brand and a real estate portfolio.
The revelation has raised questions about the true nature of the Cambridge's wealth and the extent to which their royal status has been earned through inherited wealth rather than hard work and personal achievement.
While the news has caused a stir, it is important to note that the Duchess's pre-royal wealth is not illegal or unethical. It is simply a remarkable example of how some individuals are able to amass great wealth and status through a combination of family connections and hard work.
As the public continues to grapple with the implications of this revelation, one thing is clear: the true story of Kate Middleton's wealth is far more complex and fascinating than previously thought."

She’s hoping French gets to her before it’s too late.”  As HollywoodLife.com previously reported, it’s really hard for KoKo to ignore the rumors that TT and his baby mama, Jordy Craig, are still hooking up. In fact, we’re told Khloe’s hired some private eyes to keep tabs on her dude. “She loves Tristan wholeheartedly and he’s been nothing but a stand-up, loving man,” another source told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “But she can’t help but worry sometimes. Khloe spends as much time in Cleveland as possible and has spies in every city his team plays in.”  HollywoodLifers, do you think Khloe will listen to Iggy?","Title: Iggy Azalea Warns Khloe Kardashian of Tristan Thompson's Ex-Wife Drama

According to sources close to the situation, Azalea has expressed her concerns to Kardashian about the potential for ""serious heartbreak"" should she continue to trust the NBA star with his ex-wife's complicated past.
As the world celebrated International Women's Day yesterday, Azalea was reportedly moved to take action after witnessing Kardashian's unwavering support for Thompson despite his history of infidelity. ""Khloe deserves better than to be blindsided by Tristan's ex-wife's drama,"" Azalea told a small gathering of friends and colleagues. ""I just want her to be aware of the risks involved and make an informed decision about her relationship.""
While some have criticized Azalea for interfering in Kardashian's personal affairs, those close to the singer insist that her motives are pure and her message is one of support and protection. ""Iggy has always been a strong advocate for women's rights, and this is just another example of that,"" said one source. ""She's not trying to break up Khloe and Tristan, but rather to ensure that Khloe is aware of the potential consequences of her actions.""
As the drama surrounding Thompson's ex-wife continues to unfold, it remains to be seen how Kardashian will respond to Azalea's warning. However, one thing is certain: with friends like Iggy Azalea looking out for her, Khloe Kardashian is sure to have a voice of reason and support in the midst of the storm."

We’ve got the pics of their steamy Mexican getaway  Rihanna has kept her one year romance with Saudi billionaire Hassan Jameel super private. So when rumors surfaced in June that they had broken up fans were waiting to see proof they were still a couple. They got it on July 9 when pics surfaced of the 30-year-old singer and the businessman on a sexy Mexican getaway. The two appeared to be locked in a animated conversation as bikini clad RiRi is seen pointing her right index finger in the air with her mouth open, looking like she had something important to say. In another pic Hassan is seen looking back at her with his hand on his chest as if they’re involved in a somewhat heated conversation. CLICK HERE to see all the pics.  On June 1 MediaTakeOut claimed RiRi had dumped Hassan. The site reported that “Rihanna just got tired of him. She gets tired of men sometimes,” an alleged insider told them. They said that the handsome billionaire wasn’t doing too well after the split. “Of course Rihanna broke his heart. That’s what she does — break men’s hearts.” Since Rihanna has never commented on her romance with Hassan and goes to great lengths to keep their relationship away from the public eye, MTO’s report spread like wildfire.  Obviously something is still on between Rihanna and Hassan, as they are having a hot summer together. They were first photographed a year ago making out in a pool in Spain. They’ve only been pictured a handful of times since, keeping their love undercover. The “Work” singer’s previous relationship was with Drake, 31, and it played out in public. He even professed his years of love to her in front of the world while presenting her with the Video Vanguard award at the 2016 VMAs. After having the public know all about their dating business, Ri has wisely kept her romance with Hassan as far out of the public eye as possible.  Rihanna revealed recently that Drake gushing about her on live TV made her cringe. In a May 2018 interview with Vogue, she said “Waiting through that speech was probably the most uncomfortable part. I don’t like too many compliments; I don’t like to be put on blast.” As for where she stands with Drizzy, she told the mag that they haven’t spoken and that “We don’t have a friendship now, but we’re not enemies either. It is what it is.” However she did come the close to discussing her relationship with Hassan, telling the publication that she dating and she is happy. “I used to feel guilty about taking personal time,” she revealed, “but I also think I never met someone who was worth it before,” she said about her romance with Hassan.","But now the Bajan pop star is taking to Instagram to debunk rumors of a split.

gossipcop-8598629116,1,0,"Vacation time is here let’s go girl A post shared by Steve Harvey (@iamsteveharveytv) on Jul 8, 2018 at 1:04pm PDT  Steve Harvey has effectively dispelled a rumor that bubbled up last week, claiming that he and wife Marjorie Harvey are headed for a $400 million divorce.  The talk show host on Sunday posted a photo on Instagram of him and his wife boarding a private jet.  “Vacation time is here, let’s go girl,” he captioned the Sunday, July 8 image.  The photo, which was similar to one Marjorie posted on her Instagram Story, got praise from fans.  “God bless….. stay focus[ed] don’t [lose] the vision🙏💍.”  “Enjoy yourselves, you guys deserve this vacation. Come back well rested and a stronger bond and marriage. Yahoo for the Harveys.”  Days earlier, RadarOnline reported that Marjorie walked out on Steve because he had been getting close with Kris Jenner during closed-door business meetings and ongoing phone calls and text messages.  “There was a huge blowout fight and Marjorie walked out threatening divorce,” a source told the gossip site of the reported split. “There’s no way she was going to put up with Steve hanging around a man-eater like Kris — especially since he’s proven time and again he can’t be trusted.”  Although Jenner was reportedly just stringing Steve along to get tips on TV success, one of his former talk show employes said Marjorie knows her man, who is twice divorced and cheated on both wives with the next.  “Steve has a wandering eye and he loves women!” the ex-worker told Radar anonymously. “He’s cheated during his previous marriages, and Marjorie knows he could do it again. She knows her man’s weakness — knows everything about him! That’s why she watches him so closely.”  The rumor was the talk of Twitter.  “Am I late?? Did everyone know Steve Harvey is being accused of cheating on Marjorie with Kris Jenner?! I didn’t know this 😂.”  “Steve Harvey left his wife to marry Marjorie, his side b—- of 20 years, and now she’s leaving him and running his pockets. Hilarious. Karma’s a bad b—-.”  “Boyyy if this Steve Harvey rumor is true… he gon be sick for a minute. He loves him some Marjorie.”","In a tweet on Tuesday, the TV personality and comedian announced that he is not getting a divorce from his wife of 10 years, saying ""Vacation time is here, let's go girl!""  The announcement has delighted fans who were worried about the couple's marital status after a week of tabloid speculation.
Harvey and Marjorie Harvey, who have been married since 2007, have been open about their strong marriage and frequently shower each other with affection on social media. The couple has been on vacation for the past week, celebrating their 10th wedding anniversary in style.
The rumors of the couple's impending divorce started last week when a source close to the couple told gossip website TMZ that they were planning to split up. The source claimed that the couple had been arguing over money and that their marriage had been ""strained"" for some time.
However, Harvey quickly put an end to the speculation on Tuesday, posting a message on Twitter that left little room for doubt. ""Vacation time is here, let's go girl!"" he wrote, along with a photo of himself and Marjorie Harvey enjoying their vacation.
The couple's fans were quick to react to the news, with many taking to social media to express their relief and happiness that the couple is not getting a divorce. ""So glad to hear that Steve and Marjorie are not getting a divorce,"" wrote one fan on Twitter. ""They are such a lovely couple and deserve to be together.""
Another fan added: ""Steve and Marjorie are one of my favorite couples. I'm so glad they're not getting a divorce. They have such a strong marriage and are such a great example to everyone.""
For now, it seems that the Harveys are enjoying their vacation and each other's company, and their fans are happy to see it. As for the rumors of a $400 million divorce, they can rest easy knowing that the couple is not getting a divorce anytime soon."

gossipcop-8854037683,1,0,"Titanic II is set to launch in less than two years — not in movie theaters, but on the open sea.  A replica of the world’s most famous “unsinkable” ship — which struck an iceberg and sank on its maiden voyage on April 15, 1912, killing 1,503 people — is under construction, with a maiden voyage planned for 2018.  Australian tycoon and politician Clive Palmer — not J. Bruce Ismay — is at the helm of the ambitious project to faithfully recreate the luxury ship, which will be about 13 feet wider to meet current regulations.  More importantly, it will carry enough lifeboats for every passenger and its hull will be welded, not riveted, just in case it comes across a rogue iceberg, the Belfast Telegraph reports.  “The new Titanic will of course have modern evacuation procedures, satellite controls, digital navigation and radar systems and all those things you’d expect on a 21st-century ship,” James McDonald, global marketing director of Palmer’s company, Blue Star Line, told the paper.  The new nine-deck ship will be 885 feet long, about two more than her doomed predecessor, 174 feet high and have a maximum speed of 24 knots. She will accommodate 2,400 passengers — 177 more than the RMS Titanic.  It also will feature the same categories of passengers — from the first-class movers and shakers to the hoi polloi in third class, where poor Leonardo DiCaprio was berthed in the classic movie.  Unlike the Belfast-built original, the Titanic II is under construction by the CSC Jinling Shipyard in Jiangsu, China.  Its maiden voyage will not be from Southampton to New York, but rather from Jiangsu, China, to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, the paper reported.  Some of the dead passengers’ relatives have criticized the plans for a new Titanic, but Blue Star has reportedly been flooded with requests for tickets — with some offering up to about $900,000 for a spot on the first trip.","Here is a sample piece of news based on the given sentence:
Titanic II, the highly anticipated ocean liner, is set to launch in less than two years, according to a statement released by its developers. Unlike its predecessor, the ill-fated Titanic, which sank on its maiden voyage in 1912, Titanic II is designed to be a state-of-the-art vessel with the latest safety features and technology. The ship is being built by a team of experts from around the world, and is expected to be ready for its maiden voyage in 2024.
While some have expressed concerns about the safety of such a massive vessel, the developers of Titanic II remain confident in its ability to provide a safe and enjoyable experience for passengers. ""We have learned from the past, and we are committed to ensuring that Titanic II meets the highest safety standards,"" said a spokesperson for the project. ""We are excited to offer a unique and unforgettable experience to our passengers, and we are confident that Titanic II will be a success.""
Despite the setbacks and controversies surrounding the project, the developers of Titanic II remain committed to its completion and are working tirelessly to ensure its success. With its sleek design and cutting-edge technology, Titanic II is poised to become one of the most luxurious and sought-after ocean liners in the world."

Where do they come from and who are these “sources”? Hummmm.”  In fairness, Khloe may not have been referring to this story in particular. But she also may very well have been. You get me?  Khloe still hasn’t directly commented on the Tristan situation, but she certainly has been posting some super-cryptic quotes on her social media, which give us absolutely no insight into what the hell is going on. So that’s fun…  First she tweeted this last week: “You will never ever regret being kind to someone.”  Then when someone commented, “Unless they're ungrateful for it”, she replied, “Never give to get. Always try to give without expectations. Whether that be something tangible or emotional.”  Then yesterday she went on Instagram Stories to write: “Your mind will always believe everything you tell it. Feed it faith. Feed it truth. Feed it with love.”  And then: “Nobody cares about your story until you win.

After deciding that she just can’t let go of this hunk, Mariah reportedly decided to make it happen – an engagement, that is! “Word is Mariah took matters into her own hands,” a source tells OK! magazine, “It was an unusual proposal but it did the trick. She wrote a song about how she wanted Bryan to be her husband and she performed it for him while wearing a sexy, glitzy gown. Then she explained that she’s ready for them to make their relationship official.”  Bryan gave a “hearty yes,” as the insider says, “He couldn’t believe his luck!” It appears Bryan also thinks he and Mariah belong together, and he always wants to be her baby. These two aren’t waiting around for one sweet day to tie the knot. While love takes time, Mariah and Bryan are already busy making wedding plans. “Mariah would love to get married in May at the Grand Wailea Resort in Maui,” the insider told OK!, “where she and Bryan first went public with their romance.” Mariah and Bryan struck up a relationship in late 2016, with Mariah low-key confirming the romance in February 2017 by calling Bryan her “boyfriend.”  Mariah’s “also toying with the idea of a winter wonderland wedding,” the source says. “After all, she is the queen of Christmas!” Could Mariah have the fantasy holiday wedding she’s always wanted, saying “Thank God I found you” to her honey, her all?

gossipcop-8581615474,1,1,"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired. T","Title: Katie Holmes' Love Life Under Scrutiny Again
In a shocking turn of events, Katie Holmes' personal life has once again come under scrutiny, with multiple reports suggesting that the former ""Dawson's Creek"" actress is involved in a complicated love triangle. According to sources close to the situation, Holmes has been dating actor Jamie Foxx for several months, but her ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri are not happy about their relationship.
The reports claim that Cruise and Suri are concerned about Holmes' involvement with Foxx, who they believe is not good enough for their daughter. A source told E! News that ""Tom and Suri are very protective of Katie and don't want her to get hurt again.""
Meanwhile, Holmes' camp has yet to comment on the situation, leading to speculation about the truth behind the reports. The actress, who was married to Cruise from 2006 to 2012, has been keeping a low profile since her divorce and has been focused on her acting career.
The latest developments come after several years of speculation about Holmes' personal life, including rumors of affairs with other celebrities. In 2013, Holmes filed for divorce from Cruise, citing ""irreconcilable differences."" The couple was married for six years and had one daughter together.
The news has sparked a heated debate among fans, with some defending Holmes' right to date whoever she chooses and others criticizing her for reportedly hurting her daughter and ex-husband.
As the story continues to unfold, it remains to be seen how Holmes will handle the media scrutiny and what the future holds for her personal life. One thing is for sure, however - this latest development has once again placed the spotlight on the private life of one of Hollywood's most beloved actresses."
