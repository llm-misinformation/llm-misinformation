gossipcop-2266317886,1,1,"Mark March 21, 2016 on your calendar. Dancing With the Stars will return for its 22nd season with Len Goodman back where he belongs, Bindi Irwin as the reigning champ, and a baby boy or girl for Allison Holker. There's much to look forward to, but not before we close out this season one last time with everything that happened after the finale! (In case you missed it, you can read our recap of the best and worst moments here .) Almost an hour after Tom Bergeron declared Bindi Irwin and Derek Hough the winners of season 21, Bindi was still in disbelief, shouting from the top of her lungs, ""I think I'm going to scream for 20 minutes!"" Her exuberance and genuine nature endeared her to literally every one on set, but no one more so than Derek. ""It's just so special with Bindi,"" he told reporters backstage. ""She's a champion of life."" Bindi shared the same sentiment, telling those in the ballroom that she gained another brother in Derek. In case you needed further proof that the two are friends for life, consider this: Derek's hopping on a plane to Australia in a couple weeks ""to tackle crocodiles and get my official khakis!"" The Houghster may have nabbed his sixth Mirrorball trophy, but it was his partnership with Bindi that undoubtedly made it his favorite season. ""There's not a thing I would change about this season,"" he told Glamour post-show. ""There's not a week I would change, a dance I would change, and that was a very calming, very peaceful feeling. The show is a completely different show than the first time I won, and to win at this level and the standard that this show has been raised to, it's been incredible."" While Bindi and Derek make the press rounds in New York City, it's no secret that she's itching to get back to her hometown down under. ""I can't wait to get back to all the animals, continue all the conservation work, and carry on in my dad's footsteps."" Season 21 runner-ups Sharna Burgess and Nick Carter were understandably disappointed not to win the big prize, but they both praised Bindi and Derek for their phenomenal journey this season. ""Bindi was the whole package,"" praised the red-haired stunner. ""She and Derek had a beautiful partnership."" Still, ""it's bittersweet in may ways. Did I really want this to be my first Mirrorball? Absolutely. I would be lying if I said I didn't. But Bindi was undeniable this entire season. She grew so much, and she's just such a beautiful person you can't help but be captivated by her. Both [she and Nick] are winners, and I truly believe that."" Echoed Nick: ""It was just such a pleasure to be here. I didn't expect to get anything, so anytime something great happened in the competition, it was a pleasant surprise to me."" So what's up next for Nick? Well, aside from getting ready for Baby Boy Carter , his solo album ( All American ) drops today, and he has a movie coming out next year that he wrote and directed. As for third-place contestant, Alek Skarlatos , he'll be heading on the DWTS Tour this winter, but his immediate plans are much simpler: ""I can't wait to get on the plane tonight to eat. A lot."" But what about his dating life? Any updates on that? ""It's been pretty crazy, honestly. [I haven't had time] for many dates lately."" Added Lindsay: ""I'll be his wing woman on tour!"" During all the hectic action backstage, Allison Holker was a ball of energy, especially for someone six month's pregnant. ""I feel incredible!"" gushed the pro. ""Dancing around with a baby that's the size of a football in your belly is never an easy task, but it's been amazing. Although I never expected to see myself in a sparkly costume on the Dancing With the Stars stage six months pregnant!"" Allison (and husband tWitch) will find out the baby's gender on December 10, ""which is our anniversary too."" In case you're wondering, she'll reveal whether it's a boy or a girl on social media shortly thereafter! In the meantime, Allison's prepping for her first Thanksgiving in charge of the turkey as long as the ne","Irwin was incredible."" For now, it's time to wrap up season 21 and get ready for the holiday break. As Tom Bergeron so eloquently put it: ""This has been a wild and wacky ride. We'll see you in March for season 22!"""
gossipcop-2761931201,1,0,"Lou Rocco/Getty Images  How Michael Strahan’s net worth was built  Michael Strahan has grown his wealth through 14 years of playing pro football and his second career as a talk-show host.  The son of an Army major, Strahan grew up in Germany and did not play competitive high school football until his senior year when his parents sent him to live with his aunt and uncle in Texas.  The former defensive end played well enough to earn a scholarship to Texas Southern University. By his senior year of college, he had set a record for sacks, which got the attention of the NFL.  In 1993, the New York Giants drafted Strahan as the 40th overall draft pick. Over the next 14 seasons, he became the league’s all-time quarterback sack leader, played in the Pro Bowl and helped the Giants defeat the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLII.  Upon retiring in 2008, Strahan concentrated on his off-field talents. In 2012, he became Kelly Ripa’s “Live! With Kelly” co-host, replacing longtime host Regis Philbin. Four years later, he left the show and joined ABC’s “Good Morning America”; it took more than a year for “Live” to announce Ryan Seacrest as its new co-host.  Strahan also serves as a Fox NFL Sunday analyst during the football season.  As of May 2017, Strahan’s net worth was $65 million, with a salary of $17 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.  You can use this net worth calculator to see your net worth.  Michael Strahan  Born: 1971  Birthplace: Houston  What he’s up to now  Strahan hung up his jersey in 2008, but he did not retire quietly. As of April 2016, he is a full-time co-host on ABC’s morning show “Good Morning America.”  Months later, the network hired him to host his own game show, “$100,000 Pyramid,” a reboot of an old classic. The fashionable football star also launched his own clothing line in 2015 in JC Penney stores.  Along with Curt Menefee, Terry Bradshaw, Howie Long and Jimmy Johnson, Strahan appears on “Fox NFL Sunday” each week during the NFL season.  Accolades  Throughout both his college and pro football careers, Strahan had a reputation for sacking quarterbacks, and in 2001, he set the record for most sacks in an NFL season. He also appeared in the Pro Bowl seven times.  In 2008, after his final season in the NFL, he helped lead the New York Giants to a Super Bowl victory over the New England Patriots.  As a morning show host, Strahan has earned two Daytime Emmy Awards for “Outstanding Talk Show Host” for his work on “Live! With Kelly and Michael.”","In 2014, he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.  Now, he is using his celebrity to help others. He has partnered with the United Way to help raise money for Hurricane Sandy relief efforts and has also launched the Michael Strahan Foundation to support education and character development for children."
gossipcop-7392274516,1,0,"They both looked so happy, and so relaxed. They were beaming as they said their vows, and luckily, no one came forward to provide any reason that they might not be married. (This is always an exciting moment in a ceremony.) It was an extraordinary mix of tradition and modernity, of centuries of history and up-to-the moment flourishes. Oprah was here, and so was Meghan’s mother, an African-American social worker who wore a conventional mother-of-the-bride outfit and also a nose stud. It somehow looked charming and just right. The entire royal family was here, along with a complement of English aristocrats and important personages. The music was stately and beautiful. The setting was awe-inspiring. There was a flotilla of clergymen, an extraordinary mélange including the archbishop of Canterbury and — in a striking inclusion in this most ancient of places — the head of the Episcopal Church, the Most Rev. Michael Curry. Chosen to give the address to the congregations, Bishop Curry, who is African-American, quoted Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. His voice rising and falling with emotion, he made a big, generous, impassioned case for love as the most important thing there is, in religion and in life. His address came after a reading by Lady Jane Fellowes, Harry’s aunt (her sister was Diana, Princess of Wales) that was both full of joy and a signal, it seemed, that the sadness in Harry’s life since his mother’s death had finally lifted. It was a passage from the Song of Solomon: “Arise my love, my fair one, and come away; for now the winter is past, the rain is over and gone.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story The dress was a success: sculptural simplicity. Photo Our fashion critic, Vanessa Friedman, is also watching, and she has a quick take for us on Meghan Markle’s dress. It was absolutely simple: pure and sculptural, in double bonded silk cady with a wide boatneck, long sleeves and sweeping train. It was Meghan Markle’s wedding dress. It was by Clare Waight Keller, a British woman and the first female designer of Givenchy. And it was everything people had hoped. This was not a Cinderella choice, not one that spoke of fantasy or old-fashioned fairy tales. Instead, it placed the woman proudly front and center and underscored Ms. Markle’s own independence. At the same time, it celebrated female strength, promoted a local designer and reached a hand across to Europe (where Ms. Waight Keller has a day job). The five-meter veil was of silk tulle, with a trim of hand-embroidered flowers in silk threads and organza, and contained embroidery representing the flora of all 53 Commonwealth nations. Video And it was entirely a surprise. In all the rumors that had swirled around The Dress, from Ralph & Russo to Stella McCartney, Ms. Waight Keller’s name had never come up. In the end, Ms. Markle outthought us all. As this starts, long may it continue. And the After-Party Dress The newly minted Duke and Duchess of Sussex departed Windsor for their evening reception at Frogmore House in a very James Bond fashion. The duchess wore a second dress by designer Stella McCartney. You can read our fashion critic Vanessa Friedman’s reaction here. Advertisement Continue reading the main story A good time was had by all (even before the cocktails). Photo Unlike a lot of weddings — and certainly unlike Kate and William’s wedding, just seven years ago — the guests inside hung out in the aisles, air-kissing and gossiping. It’s a great royal-and-celebrity cocktail party! (Sadly without cocktails.) Kate and William’s wedding was solemn, stately, stuffy, full of dignitaries, politicians, and the sort of boring personages known here as the great and the good. But this looked totally fun for the guests — even more fun than, say, the Academy Awards — because no one was competing for anything and no one was forced to talk about their outfits to television reporters. Part of the change in tone is down to the passage of time and to how much Britain, or perhaps","Pharrell Williams, the singer and songwriter, was in the pews, and looked delighted to be there. And there was Elton John, who sang “Your Song” at the wedding and wore a shimmering suit. Pharrell Williams was in the pews, and looked delighted to be there. Photo The service itself was absolutely beautiful, a remarkable melding of the traditions of the Church of England and the African Methodist Episcopal Church, with the Most Rev. Michael Curry delivering an extraordinary sermon about love. The highlight of the ceremony came when the newlyweds exchanged vows, and Harry said something that was just perfect: “I promise to love, cherish and honor you, and to be your husband and friend, through the ups and downs of life, until death do us part.” Meghan replied, “I promise to love, cherish and honor you, and to be your wife and friend, through the ups and downs of life, until death do us part.” The service was attended by 600 guests, including 53 countries’ representatives and 26 members of the British royal family. Photo The ceremony was conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who put the couple’s love at the heart of the service. The hymns were chosen by the couple, and included “Guiding Light” and “Love Divine All Loves Excelling.” Photo The wedding was watched by millions of people around the world, and was covered extensively by the global media.

gossipcop-470066082,1,0,"Demi Lovato has sparked rumors of a new romance with Lauren Abedini, a Los Angeles-based DJ who goes by the stage name Kittens. According to Page Six, Lovato was spotted holding hands with Abedini in Disneyland over the weekend, causing fans and media outlets to speculate whether they could be dating. This is only the latest speculation surrounding Lovato’s love life, as the pop singer has never officially confirmed her sexuality– despite alluding to her being bisexual in her song lyrics. Here’s what you need to know about Demi Lovato’s sexuality: 1.

The bad news is that it isn't me. — ste(screeching into the wilderness)ph (@stphfrndz) September 11, 2017 2. She’s Had Relationships With Several Male Celebrities Lovato, like most notable celebrities, have dated other people in the industry. According to Pop Sugar, she dated The Cab frontman Alex DeLeon from 2008-09, and later based the breakup song “Catch Me” on him. Lovato also had brief flings with Trace Cyrus (Miley’s older brother) in 2009 and Joe Jonas, her self-proclaimed “BFF,” in 2010. Her most notable relationship to date, however, has been with Valderrama, whom she dated from from 2010 to 2016. In an interview with Latina magazine, Lovato discussed what attracted her to the That 70’s Show actor: When I dated white guys, it wasn’t as passionate as my relationship with Wilmer. Maybe that’s just Wilmer. But I do believe that Latin people are just more expressive, more passionate with their emotions. He’s very manly, and he can be stubborn like Latino men can, but he’s protective and he cares so much and loves so hard. I’ve been blessed enough to have him in my life, and not just as my man, but also my best friend. Since her breakup from Valderrama, Lovato’s been seen with MMA fighter Guilherme “Bomba” Vasconcelos and Abedini. 3. Ruby Rose Claims that She & Lovato ‘Hooked Up’ in 2013 In 2013, model and actress Ruby Rose turned heads when she tweeted that she had a lesbian tryst with Lovato. “I’m like the one person demi has slept with that didn’t sell on naked photos of her so eff off,” Rose tweeted out. She went on to say “Think ill take a few days off social media whilst @ddlovato’s friends attack me for being a ‘scorned ex-lover’ get over it! I liked the hair.” Furthermore, a source for Life & Style said that Rose and Lovato dated for two years while the singer took a break from her relationship with Valderrama. A post shared by Ruby Rose (@rubyrose) on Aug 13, 2017 at 1:32pm PDT Lovato addressed these claims in a 2015 interview with Complex magazine. “Rumours are rumours, a","to get it right” seem to point to a possible same-sex crush. When asked by a fan on Twitter if the song was about a girl, Lovato responded “Not denying or confirming anything.” She also sang the song at her show in Tokyo that year, where she covered part of the lyrics with a sign that read “Equality for all.” Watch the performance below: In an interview with The Guardian in 2017, Lovato addressed the topic again, saying “I think I’m still learning myself. I’m still trying to figure out who I am and what I want. I don’t think I’ve ever been in a relationship where I’ve been like, ‘Oh, I’m so happy that I’m with a girl’ or ‘I’m so happy that I’m with a guy’. I think I’ve just always been attracted to people, and that’s not something I can change. I’m just trying to figure out who I am and be the best person I can be.”"
gossipcop-5319163677,1,1,"Come December, it's become near tradition over the past few years for everyone to complain about how the previous 12 months have been the worst ever. This year, however really, really feels like it. This year has been a barrage of bizarre and bummer headlines that at times it's felt like some dystopian nightmare.  It's been so bad that the Kardashian-West clan have just decided to end 2016 early. Yes, Kim and Kanye have decided to cancel all public and professional commitments for the end of the year and plan to maintain their social media blackouts as well. To be exact, a flack told Page Six that Kim and Kanye “plan on taking the rest of 2016 off and spending time as a family.""  Which, frankly, we wish we all could do, don't we?  Is it possible for President Obama's last major act to be an executive decree for us to just all get a chance to chill out and recuperate for the remaining 26 days left in this bummer of a year? Sure, there's no political safeguarding against any potential additional music legends from dying or preventing any further tragedies and disasters from happening or ensuring that some new odd Zika-like disease pops up, but there's got to be something? How about the ""Netflix and Chill Act?"" Just an order that all Americans get to spend the next month relaxing and catching up on any television series they may have missed this year.  Of course, when it comes to Kim and Kanye it's understandable that they've decided to literally cancel the rest of their 2016. Kim was still in the midst of recuperating from being robbed at gunpoint in Paris when her husband Kanye was hospitalized following a very public breakdown.  They've had to endure these private tragedies while also dealing with immense public interest and rumors running rampant in the tabloid press.  E!, the home of the Kardashian's reality TV empire, reports that a family source says ""Kim is doing okay despite reports.""  ""She has many things on her plate so being overwhelmed is expected,"" the source continued. ""She wants to get Kanye back on his feet. She is not leaving him. She loves him.""  Kanye was released from an L.A.-area hospital last week after spending more than a week receiving treatment for exhaustion. Kim West was reportedly by his side throughout the entire ordeal and now wants to make sure Kanye continues to receive therapy and treatment now that he's out of the hospital.  Despite your personal opinion on the pair, it certainly does seem like the family deserves the rest. In addition to their dual ordeal, they also have two young children to care for after all (in fact, today is Saint West's first birthday). Maybe it's best we all let them lay low and chill for the next month or so.  Unfortunately, we all don't have the luxury as much as we wish we could. Then again, it's not looking like 2017 is shaping up to be any better. Hopefully, a rested and healthier Kim and Kanye can get back into form and provide us with the not-quite-as-tragic-as-this distractions we'll probably desperately need in the new year.  Update: Kanye, for one, has now reappeared in public, albeit in a very low-key way. He was spotted with newly blond hair at designer Rick Owens' furniture show in Los Angeles .","Kim, on the other hand, is still laying low. 
Paraphrased passage:
This year has been particularly challenging for the Kardashian-West family, with Kim and Kanye experiencing personal tragedies and dealing with intense public scrutiny. In response, they have decided to take the rest of the year off to focus on their family and personal well-being. While this decision may be seen as a luxury for some, it is important to recognize that the family deserves this time to recharge and recover. Despite the challenges they have faced, Kim and Kanye remain committed to each other and their children, and it is hoped that they will be able to return to their professional and public lives in a healthy and refreshed state. Unfortunately, it is unlikely that 2017 will bring any respite from the difficulties that have plagued 2016, but the Kardashian-West family's example serves as a reminder of the importance of taking care of oneself in the face of adversity."

The groom, Prince Harry, is a member of the British royal family; the bride, Meghan Markle, is an American and former actress.[note 1] On the morning of the wedding, Prince Harry's grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, conferred upon him the titles of Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel. On her marriage, Markle became Duchess of Sussex.[1] The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, officiated at the wedding using the standard Anglican church service for Holy Matrimony published in Common Worship, the liturgical text of the Church of England.[2][3] Announcement of engagement [ edit ] Prince Harry is the second son of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Diana, Princess of Wales. He and Meghan Markle, an American actress best known for her role in the Canadian-American legal-drama television series Suits, have been in a relationship since 2016, having first met in July 2016.[4] The relationship was officially acknowledged on 8 November 2016, when a statement was released from the royal family's communications secretary addressing the ""wave of abuse and harassment"" directed toward Markle.[5] Harry and Meghan attending church on Christmas Day, 2017 On 27 November 2017, Clarence House announced that Prince Harry would marry Markle in the spring of 2018.[6] They were engaged earlier the same month in London, with the Prince giving Markle a bespoke engagement ring made by Cleave and Company, the court jewellers and medalists to the Queen, consisting of a large central diamond from Botswana, with two smaller diamonds from his mother's jewellery collection.[7] At the same time, it was announced that they would live at Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace following their marriage.[8] The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh expressed their delight at the news, while congratulations came in from various political leaders, including the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, and the Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn. After the announcement, the couple gave an exclusive interview to Mishal Husain of BBC News.[8] During the public announcement of the engagement at Kensington Palace's Sunken Gardens, Markle wore a bottle knee-length emerald green dress with bow detailing at the cinched waist by Italian label P.A.R.O.S.H and a white trench coat by Canadian brand Line the Label.[9][10] Hours after the announcement, the website of Line the Label crashed down due to the number of people who were trying to order the coat.[7][11] Markle is the second American[note 2] and the first person of mixed race heritage to marry into the British royal family.[12] The engagement announcement prompted much comment about the possible social significance of Markle becoming a proudly mixed-race royal.[13][14][15][16][17] Under the terms of the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, the first six persons in the line of succession require the Sovereign's consent in order to marry.

gossipcop-6803836615,1,1,"What do Katy Perry, Meryl Streep, Anderson Cooper and Chelsea Clinton have in common? They have all eaten human flesh at LA’s notorious cannibal restaurant, Cannibal Club.  The private restaurant has long operated under the radar in Los Angeles, with rumors circulating about who has attended and what is really served behind closed doors. Now a leaked Cannibal Club document has exposed some of the notorious restaurant’s “elite” patrons.  CANNIBALISM ‘MORE POPULAR THAN YOU MIGHT THINK’  Meryl Streep, Chelsea Clinton and CNN’s Anderson Cooper all hold Cannibal Club membership, according to the document. Katy Perry, who has previously said that “Cannibalism is way more popular than you might think” and “human flesh is the best meat“, is also a regular diner.  Boasting that the restaurant is the “cutting edge of experimental cuisine” and serves “L.A.’s cultural elite“, the Cannibal Club website makes clear they “specialize in the preparation of human meat” that comes from “young and healthy bodies.“  Cannibal Club’s visiting chefs “hail from around the world” and come to L.A. to “practice their craft free of compromise and unbounded by convention,” according to the Cannibal Club website.  ‘FILMMAKERS, INTELLECTUALS, AND CELEBRITIES’  “Our exclusive clientele includes noted filmmakers, intellectuals, and celebrities who have embraced the Enlightenment ideals of free expression and rationalism. On event nights, avant-garde performance artists, celebrated literary figures, and ground-breaking musicians entertain our guests.  “At Cannibal Club, we celebrate artistic excellence as the natural and inevitable expression of the unbridled human spirit.“  Describing each dish as a “study in taste and elegance“, Chef de Cuisine Sophie Laffite explains: “The meat we serve is selected from the young and healthy. Consistent with the practice of cannibalism in many primitive societies, we view anthropophagy as homage to the dead, who are reborn into the bodies of their consumers.”  But don’t think you can just walk in there and check the place out. The private restaurant operates a strict vetting policy, according to the website:  “It is necessary for us to operate privately and to vette our members in order to avoid disruption from the less enlightened.“  HUMAN MEAT MENU  The current menu listed on the site includes Sirloin Steak (human meat, flame-broiled 8oz), Liver and Mushroom Pirozhi (“a Russian version of pierogies, baked rather than boiled, with a savory filling of wild mushrooms and human liver“) and Placenta Lasagne (“an otherwise traditional lasagna with one layer of cheese substituted by minced placenta in heirloom tomato sauce, seasoned with garlic, onion and oregano”.)  Elspeth Blake, the Cannibal Club proprietor who claims to have earned her stripes working under Vincent Sardi Jr. in New York, did not immediately respond to our questions regarding where the human flesh comes from.  ‘YOUNG AND HEALTHY BODIES’  In the FAQ section of the website, Cannibal Club claims:  “Most of the businesses and institutions who supply us prefer to keep those relationships discreet. On the individual level, bodies are often bequeathed to us. For some, this is a way to supplement life insurance and offset funerary expenses. For others, such as Cannibal Club member Gwendoline Fenwich, who was served to her friends and relatives at the Club in January of 2008, being prepared as a meal, and thereby reborn into the bodies of the living, is an attractive alternative to the more the traditional practices of burial and cremation.“  The revelation that Hollywood royalty, pop stars and cable TV anchors consume human flesh when they are in Los Angeles is merely the latest example of public figures being exposed as dark figures, reveling in the darkness. Jay-Z described Jesus Christ as “the original fake news“ late in 2017. Miley Cyrus said “Hail Satan” on live radio and claimed she has a closer relationship with the devil than with her “earthly father”, Billy R","ae Cyrus. And who could forget Taylor Swift’s infamous “eye-of-the-beholder” tweet last summer?  “Eating people is not only delicious, but also an existential expression of freedom and creativity,” says Cannibal Club co-founder and culinary director, Luna Laffite.  “The Club is an oasis for artists and intellectuals who crave the sublime, and seek to push the boundaries of what is deemed acceptable by a society increasingly mired in conformity and mediocrity.”

gossipcop-8055383376,1,0,"Yes, the headline sounds extremely insane, but then again this is Teresa Giudice we’re talking about here!  According to a new report, the Real Housewives of New Jersey star is planning to cash in on her husband Joe Giudice’s deportation proceedings.  If you recall, it was reported weeks ago that a judge had ruled that Joe should be deported upon his release from prison, where he is currently serving a 41-month-prison sentence for bank and wire fraud. Well now, sources are telling Radar Online that Bravo has offered Teresa $500,000 to film a special about his deportation.  “Teresa was offered big bucks to film a special about Joe’s deportation and she agreed to do it,” an insider revealed. “Half a million dollars to share the story on camera.”  And this story is believable because this isn’t Teresa’s first rodeo when it comes to cashing in on her crimes legal drama!  “It is going to be like the other specials when she was in prison and will show how she and Joe and the girls are handling the scary prospect of Joe getting deported,” added the source.  IS TERESA BEGGING PRESIDENT TRUMP TO STOP JOE’S DEPORTATION?  Earlier this year, an Immigration official confirmed that “records show that an immigration judge ordered Mr. Giudice be removed from the United States on March 14, 2018.”  A source close to Teresa adds that she needs the Bravo money as Joe tries to appeal the deportation order.  “Teresa will do anything for the money. She never stops thinking about taking care of her girls and she agreed to this so that they would have money for college. She is a good mom and wants to provide for her children,” the source stated.  Joe will reportedly be turned over to ICE custody upon his March 2019 release, although it is likely he could be released earlier than March which would mean an earlier deportation back to Italy.  UPDATE – Teresa is denying this report. Her attorney, James Leonard, tells the Gossip Cop website that she has no current plans to do a spinoff show about Joe’s possible deportation.

gossipcop-5210414258,1,1,"The things you plan the least sometimes turn out the best. This is why every right-thinking person hates St Valentine’s Day. Scheduling a day for romance is as joyful as a deflated heart-shaped balloon.  We’re in Stanley’s on St Andrew’s Street in Dublin, downstairs in the wine bar. It’s an unplanned outing after an impromptu cry of “Let’s go out, but not to our usual place”. I’ve eaten here before, and enjoyed it except for some oversalted fish. This is a second chance. They don’t come easily.  But two things happened after the previous review. First, a man who was at the next table wrote to me to say how much he loved Stanley’s. He had no vested interest, but was talking as a well-dined eater about town. Later, I found out that chef and co-owner Stephen McArdle had something more important on his hands than my dinner that night. His son had been born hours before.  If that doesn’t earn a second chance, nothing will. So we’re tucked in at a small table under the sloping ceiling. The walls are painted a soft green. There’s a candle in a wax-crusted wine bottle on the table and high-class jazz standards on the sound system.  For the moment, it feels like we’re not in Dublin. We could be in a city anywhere and lucky enough to find a place we’ll remember fondly when we get home.  The menu is chalked up on the wall and Liam has already ordered some cod croquettes, balls of soft fluffy fish in crispy lagging jackets sitting in a small puddle of silken house mayonnaise.  The star of Stanley’s is Morgan Vanderkamer. She’s the sommelier here. But don’t let that put you off. Bad sommeliers are pretentious up-sellers, there to push diners towards the wallet-busting bruisers on the wine list. Vanderkamer has taken the nonsense out of the role and will open your mind to new ideas about what to drink with your food. If you thought sherry was for fogeys and posers, she will change your mind. So we have ice-cold glasses of manzanilla to cut through the fluffy cod croquettes. We are in excellent hands.  The main event is the Irish charcuterie sharing plate. We’re going with an oloroso, the ruby-coloured sherry that gets its colour and kick from time and ageing. There are two on the menu, Vanderkamer says. One is good; the other is “amazing”, and priced accordingly, she warns. With a €16 plate of food between us, we push the sherry cask out and live it large on the oloroso at €13 a glass. It is a good decision.  There’s a small farmyard on that €16 charcuterie plate: generous slices of duck ham, smoked cured slices of moist pink meat. The duck ham is the soulmate of the apricot puree dotted on one side of the plate. The sharp pickled gherkins sing with the “bacon and cabbage”, a slice of ham hock terrine wrapped in crinkly soft leaves of bright-green savoy cabbage. There are two small delicate slabs of mi-cuit fois gras, delicate to the point of dissolving on contact with the tongue. The pear and vanilla sauce, in a small ramekin, takes the sweetness of the liver to another even more decadent place.  Just in case there isn’t enough on the plate (there is), we’ve ordered a plate of the bean and chorizo stew. The beans are in fact chick peas – but that’s even better in my book – and the chorizo has been minced to a small rubble that sits on top of the soupy mix. It’s the kind of stew where the juices have transformed from separate elements of meat, tomato, oil and wine into one glistening sheen. We get a blended Priorat, a Spanish red as heartwarming as the stew, to sip with it.  Dessert would be an option only for people less greedy in their savoury ordering. There’s a final glass of Rasteau, a fortified Grenache that’s served deliciously chilly. It’s a thought-provoking alternative to a syrupy dessert wine, and next time we’ll leave space for some cheese to go with it.  Romantic is a bleached-out word, but that’s what Stanley’s wine bar is: a properly love-it romantic joint, a new favourite to add to your list.  Dinner for two, with sherries a","plenty and a bottle of Priorat, was €110.  When I got home, I thought about the evening and decided to write this review.  
Paraphrased passage: The restaurant we visited, Stanley's, is a cozy and intimate setting with a warm and inviting atmosphere. The menu offers a variety of dishes, including seafood, meat, and cheese plates, as well as a selection of wines to pair with each dish. Our server, Morgan Vanderkamer, was knowledgeable and helpful in selecting the perfect wine to complement our meal. The charcuterie sharing plate was a standout dish, featuring a variety of cured meats and pickled vegetables. The oloroso sherry we chose to pair with it was excellent, and the small farmyard of duck ham, smoked cured meat, and pickled gherkins was a delight. For dessert, we shared a glass of Rasteau, a fortified Grenache that was a perfect conclusion to the meal. Overall, Stanley's is a romantic and enjoyable dining experience that offers a unique and memorable meal."

Amidst rumors that the actress is marrying a British businessman, she’s put permanent roots down in California by purchasing the massive Cecil B. DeMille estate — check out pics of the lavish mansion here.  Angelina Jolie, 41, has a new home in Los Angeles…and it’s stunning. It’s been rumored for weeks that the 41-year-old had plans to purchase Cecil B. DeMille’s historic mansion, and now, she’s bit the bullet, putting down a $25 million offer, according to TMZ. The amount was reportedly accepted by the owner and is currently in escrow.  Cecil’s home, which he lived in until his death in 1959, is considered one of the greatest properties in L.A., and Angie will have some famous neighbors, including Casey Affleck, Natalie Portman and Ellen Pompeo. There’s tons of space for the six kids, too — the house boasts 6 bedrooms and 10 bathrooms, plus a spacious backyard.  This huge purchase comes following rumors that Angie planned on moving her kids to London so she could work there after her September 2016 split from Brad Pitt, 53. The possibility of that big move happening seemed even more likely after reports surfaced on April 12 that Angie had met and fallen in love with a British philanthropist and businessman, whose identity has not been revealed.  The actress is reportedly already serious with this mystery man, and a family friend told InTouch that she’s even planning on marrying him! However, we also know that Brad and Angie’s divorce has been much more amicable recently, and she’s been letting him spend more and more time with the kids. Perhaps staying in Los Angeles is her way of making sure Pax, Maddox, Zahara, Shiloh, Vivienne and Knox continue to have a relationship with their father? Either way, the house is insane — check it out in the gallery above.  HollywoodLifers, what do you think of Angelina’s new house?

gossipcop-8609335343,1,1,"Oh boy.  The first rule of going solo: Distance yourself as far as possible from the group and fan base that jump-started your career. Or so goes the advice Liam Payne is apparently following from Zayn: He’s the last to venture out on his own and the first to come out burning a bridge he still has to cross when it’s all said and done. On Liam’s first single, “Strip That Down,” he’s dissed One Direction plain as day. “You know I used to be in 1D, now I’m out free,” he sings. “People want me for one thing, that’s not me. I’m not changing the way that I used to be, I just want to have fun and get rowdy.”    But with nearly all remaining members of One Direction releasing new music of their own within weeks of each other, this song is not the only opportunity Payne has had to make his thoughts on his bandmates known. Speaking with Music Choice, he complimented Niall Horan’s new singles, but Harry Styles, not so much. “I’ll be honest with you, it’s not my sort of music. It’s not something I’d listen to,” he said. But he did have a quick save: “I think he did a great job of doing what he wanted to do. That’s the way I’d put it best, I think.” Liam also noted that Harry would probably say the same about his music since Harry doesn’t listen to hip-hop. “My song’s more ‘Rack City’ and his song is more of a different era to something I’d listen to, I guess,” he said. “Strip That Down” does feature a rapper, Migos’s Quavo, but a redux of the only song of note that Tyga has ever made it is not.","So it seems like Payne is trying to distance himself from his old band, One Direction, while also showing off his new sound. But will it work? Only time will tell. Paraphrased passage: Liam Payne is taking a unique approach to going solo by distancing himself from his former group, One Direction, and their fan base. He has publicly dissed the band in his music and has expressed admiration for his bandmates' new music, except for Harry Styles.

gossipcop-4796409702,1,1,"Kim Kardashian is allegedly “phasing out” mom Kris Jenner, particularly when it comes to her responsibilities as her longtime manager, amid reports Kim is ready for a total image overhaul after returning to the spotlight following her October robbery.  That’s according to a new report by Radar Online, who’s claiming that the mother-daughter duo could be caught in a nasty feud as a source alleged that Kardashian has had somewhat of an epiphany during her time away from the spotlight and allegedly has now opened her eyes to see how Jenner “used her” to build the Kardashian brand.  According to the site, Kim is ready to project a very different image from the uber-glamorous money flaunting Kardashian fans used to know and is allegedly ready to kick mom Kris to the curb, at least professionally, in order to do so.  A source alleged to the site this week that Kim now “seems to be thinking that Kris used her to get where she is today,” which Radar Online is alleging could have led to a nasty feud between Jenner and her daughter as well as the reality star reportedly making a pretty big business decision when it comes to her mom.  “[Kim] will never think of [Kris] in the same way again,” the source said of Jenner’s supposed drama with her daughter amid reports she believes Jenner has been “using” her for years.  The site then went on to report that Kim is now in the process of projecting her new toned-down image amid the feud claims with Kris, revealing that Jenner may no longer play such a big part in Kardashian’s career going forward.  “Kim hired a transition team to make sure that she gives off a different image than she did previously,” the source said of Jenner and her daughter potentially parting ways professionally, claiming that “part of this process includes phasing out [Kris’s] management.”  While Kris and Kim have not commented on the claims, this isn’t the first time it’s been reported that Kardashian may be looking to distance herself from Jenner, at least professionally, in the wake of her October robbery in Paris.  Radar Online claimed back in October that Kim Kardashian had grown wise to Kris Jenner’s “money making machine” after taking some downtime at the end of 2016, alleging at the time that Kim has been so busy with her career that she’s failed to realize how much Jenner, who is often referred to as her “momager,” had been controlling her life and career.  “Kim never realized how much [Kris] and the money-making machine was controlling her until this robbery,” an insider told the site of Kardashian’s feelings about Jenner at the time, months before it was reported that the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star is allegedly looking to “phase out” Kris from her career.  “Kim is just starting to think that maybe Kris’s intentions were not pure all along,” continued the source in October, adding that Kim has been doing a lot of thinking about her father Robert Kardashian while taking some time away which has allegedly helped her to get wise to Kris’s seemingly relentless pursuit of fame for herself and her family.  “[Kim] told her family that she wanted to be the girl that her father wanted her to be and not the girl that she became with Kris’s help,” a source revealed last year, just months before it was reported that a feud could be brewing between Kardashian and Jenner.  What do you think of reports claiming Kim Kardashian and mom Kris Jenner could be caught in a feud amid claims Kim is attempting to “phase out” her mother’s management?  [Featured Image by Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images]","Paraphrased:  Kim Kardashian is allegedly distancing herself from her mother Kris Jenner, particularly in regards to her professional responsibilities as her manager, following her robbery in Paris.

gossipcop-3967904178,1,1,"Watch Entertainment Tonight on Yahoo View.  Music’s odd couple, Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton — aka the rocker and the country boy — have never been free of gossip speculating about their relationship. Apparently, the latest news is that the two are through. In Touch Weekly reports that Shelton actually unceremoniously dumped Stefani in February before embarking on a tour.  But wait — if that’s the case, then why is Stefani appearing with him on stage? And not just appearing … they’re appearing pretty cuddly. The singer posted an Instagram shot on Mar. 14 of the two embracing on what appears to be the most recent date of his “Country Music Freaks” trek.      This isn’t the first such picture she has shared since February. She posted several different angles of a jumbotron kiss on Feb. 25, and on March 11, one of herself hanging out with country up-and-comer Carly Pearce, who is an opener on Shelton’s tour, and another that shows off a backstage crowd (including Shelton and her younger brother Todd) in Greensboro, N.C.      Additionally, she sent good wishes to him on Mar. 1 — when Shelton was reportedly attempting to power through a Houston date while sick with the flu — and shared his latest video, “I Lived It” with a glowing string of hashtags.      So if the breakup is fake news, what spurred the rumors? According to In Touch‘s “insider” source, all of Stefani’s social media support is “a desperate attempt to ignore the truth,” and Shelton dumped her due to her “neediness and all the drama: her demanding, critical ex-husband, and her jealousy of him and other women.”  If this is to be believed, current Voice champion Chloe Kohanski was a factor in the breakup — Coach Shelton was apparently getting too close for Stefani’s comfort — as well as Shelton’s ex-wife Miranda Lambert, with whom the outlet claims he has rekindled a friendship and is “sharing intimate details” of his life.  Shelton isn’t reciprocating Stefani’s loving social media deluge — but then again, he’s never been one to do so. His social media accounts, once a source of ribald jokes, have developed gradually into a more businesslike platform to market his music and work on The Voice. He does, however, maintain a picture of Stefani as his profile photo.  Read more from Yahoo Entertainment:","Watch Entertainment Tonight on Yahoo View.

gossipcop-1634815619,1,1,"California is “the darkest state in the Union,” according to country singer Dolly Parton, who claims that the state has been hit with a series of “Biblical disasters” in recent times as punishment for “embracing Satan and rejecting God.”  Parton predicted Los Angeles will suffer a similar fate to Sodom and Gomorrah, the Biblical cities synonymous with vice, darkness and impenitent sin.  “California just keeps on being hit by disaster after disaster as foretold in the Bible,” the Grammy Award-winning entertainer and businesswoman told guests at Dolly Parton’s Stampede, a dinner and entertainment evening.  “Pestilence, and epidemics, and crime, and disease. And you know what? They don’t even realize what is happening to them. They are so corrupted, they can’t even see what is right in front of their eyes.”  “First they had the drought that lasted years and years, killing off billions and billions of dollars in crops, and making the soil so incredibly dry that a large rainstorm could easily turn into a major flood.  “Then they had the fires. Awful, awful fires. Historical, deadly fires. Thousands lost their homes, scores lost their lives and their livelihoods. Did you know the Thomas fire is still burning? In the winter!“  “And now they just had dozens of homes destroyed by mudslides,” Tennessee-born Parton said, making reference to the mudslides that have killed 15 people, with the toll expected to climb above 30. The mudslide hit an affluent part of California, and damaged Oprah Winfrey’s house.  “When they get hit with the ‘Big One‘, Parton said, referencing the popular name for the super quake expected to rock California in the future, “then we will know that the End Times have truly begun.”  “And don’t forget the sexual abuse scandals rocking Hollywood. They are being punished for embracing Satan and rejecting God.”  Is California suffering from bad weather and bad luck, or is Parton right? Could a vengeful God be punishing California for decades of vice and sin?  Parton, who has sold more than 100 million records worldwide and been nominated for two Academy Awards, has previously stated that she considers herself an entertainer, and doesn’t believe it is her role to get involved with politics.  At last year’s Emmys, Parton was joined onstage by Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda to present an award. Tomlin and Fonda took the opportunity to criticize President Donald Trump, but Parton refused to join in, maintaining a dignified silence.","“I think that we are all entitled to our opinions, and I think it’s important to express them in a respectful manner, and I don’t think it’s my place to get involved in politics,” Parton told reporters after the ceremony.

In a video being circulated, which is entitled - Rihanna: ‘If Jesus Hasn’t Answered Your Prayers, Try Satan’, published December 2, 2017, on the World News Today YouTube Channel, a scripted voice says that Rihanna told the audience that growing up in Bridgetown was not easy and that you have to work twice as hard to make it. And the British anonymous voice went on to say that she said:  ""You have to hustle. I’m still hustling, but I am living proof that you can do anything... If you came here for tips I can give y’all the biggest one straight off...  ""If y'all have prayed to Jesus for years, prayed with all your hearts and got nothing back from him? ... Jesus doesn't care about you. Do you really even think he even listening? Hot tip y'all because you are my people, be efficient, go to satan.""  Then it went on to claim that the Prime Minister of Barbados the Rt. Hon. Freundel Stuart intervened hastily and shocked parents removed their children. On the night in question, the Prime Minister conferred the title of Cultural Ambassador on Robyn 'Rihanna' Fenty.  The only thing the video got right in that blurb was the name of Barbados' Prime Minister.  There was also an article on YourNewsWire.com with the same title and the same quotes written by Baxter Dmitry and posted December 1, 2017.  Loop News was there on site and recorded Rihanna's speech. Honoured, the young Grammy-award winner encouraged children and persons to believe in their dreams and have faith in God.  Rihanna told the crowd which included her friends and family, and numerous dignitaries, that she had no idea how she would get discovered on this little Rock but her dreams started on Westbury New Road, now named Rihanna Drive and she believed in her dreams, so ""believe in your dreams"", as cliche as it may sound.  Rihanna added:  ""I always knew it would happen, I always focused on the result, and that kind of faith, it really was just faith that childlike faith, that even now when I get a little bit discouraged or doubtful, it’s the thing that I go back to, having faith in God, like that even as a child.”  (Photo caption: Rihanna with her head bowed during the opening prayer at the renaming ceremony. (PHOTO: Richard Grimes))  On the fake YouTube video many people in the comments said that the video was a hoax and a lie. People called for the voice clip and video showing Rihanna making that fabricated speech and they asked why the video was missing from all other news agencies.

gossipcop-2682199068,1,1,"Reverend Swadley – the local wedding priest and friend of the Pitt family – has confirmed to friends that the A-list couple recently spent a week with Brad’s family, discussing detailed plans for a wedding.  It’s believed the loved-up stars had flown to Missouri because Jen was desperate to reconnect with Brad’s mum, Jane, who she’d developed a very close bond with throughout the time of their first marriage.  During the seven-day visit, it’s been revealed that Jane orchestrated a meeting with the family priest Reverend Swadley – hoping it would be the gentle push Brad and Jen would need to make their reignited relationship official once again.  ‘Reverend Swadley met Jen recently at a family function that Brad’s mum, Jane, threw at their family home in Missouri,’ a close friend of the pastor’s told New Idea exclusively.  ‘Jen accompanied Brad home on the trip and attended church services with the family as well as joining Brad at meetings at the now-retired reverend’s home, who Brad reconnected with after he decided to find himself and renew his faith, following his split from Ange.  ‘He remarked at how at ease Jen was with his family, who clearly adore her, and how everyone said how much she’s been missed and how happy they all were to have her back in Brad’s – and their – lives.’  The source goes on to reveal that Reverend Swadley spoke at length with Brad and Jen about getting married as soon as possible, in Missouri, in a small ceremony, with just local friends and family present.  ‘Reverend Swadley revealed how in love Brad and Jen were and how they planned to officially wed as soon as their divorces were finalised, with him agreeing to conduct the ceremony and welcome them both back into the church,’ the friend of the pastor told New Idea.  Reverend Swadley revealed to our source that it was clear Jen loved seeing Brad’s family again, spending long days talking and laughing for the first time since their 2005 divorce.  ‘Jen spent five days reconnecting with Brad’s parents, brother and sister and many of his childhood friends who he remains close to,’ a friend of the pastor reveals.  Brad Pitt's parents are nothing but supportive Getty  ‘He said Jen kept saying how grateful she was that they’d been brought back together. And how they’ll both be baptised later this year before they officially wed – with Jen’s father, John, vowing to be at her side for the service and give her away again at their wedding, which will hopefully take place shortly after and be far more low-key than their original star-studded nuptials in Malibu.’  It’s the latest chapter in the pair’s rekindled romance since Jen announced her split from estranged husband Justin Theroux in February. She has wasted no time in rebuilding her relationship with ex-husband Brad, spending time with his six children, and developing a unique and special bond with his 11-year-old daughter Shiloh.  It’s that close relationship between Jen and his kids that has prompted Brad to want to marry Jen as soon as soon as possible.  ‘Brad’s mum Jane was all over them to get married as soon as possible, but the truth is Brad needs no convincing,’ says a source close to Brad. ‘They still want to keep this relationship close to their chest and out of the public eye, but behind closed doors they couldn’t be happier.  ‘And for Brad, seeing how much his children – especially Shiloh – love Jen has just made his heart soar. He knows he wants Jen to be his wife again.  ‘We’re pretty sure they’ll be married in Missouri before the end of the year, Brad and Jen are both keen to push through their divorces as soon as possible so they can walk down the aisle together. That’s all that they want.’  For the full story see this weeks issue of New Idea - out now!","Paraphrased passage:

There are a lot of things we can do about it. But we don’t. Which is interesting, because when someone with a beard attacks us, we tap phones, we invoke travel bans, we build walls. We take every possible precaution to make sure it doesn’t happen again. But when an American buys a gun and kills other Americans, then there’s nothing we can do about that. Because [of] the Second Amendment.

gossipcop-12955535,1,0,"The FCC has decided against taking any action on Stephen Colbert’s May 1 Late Show broadcast, in which he treated President Donald Trump to a series of increasingly Rabelaisian insults, in response to on-air insults Trump had delivered earlier in the day to CBS News-man John Dickerson.  Colbert’s slew of frat-boy remarks culminated in a crack that the only thing Trump’s mouth is good for “is being Vladimir Putin’s [expletive] holster.” The naughty word was bleeped in the broadcast, and Colbert’s mouth was pixelated. But, intrepid journalists, who are paid to ferret out the truth, discovered what was the word, and they printed it – minus the offending syllable, of course.  All hell broke loose.  Trump called Colbert “no-talent guy.” Colbert’s monologue was plastered by some as inappropriately vulgar, by others as homophobic. The FCC received thousands of complaints. Reporters breathlessly reported Colbert was under FCC investigation, and a good time was had by all.  Today, however, the FCC put an end to the fun, saying in a statement: “Consistent with standard operating procedure, the FCC’s Enforcement Bureau has reviewed the complaints and the material that was the subject of these complaints.”  “The Bureau has concluded that there was nothing actionable under the FCC’s rules.”  In rough numbers, the FCC was saying that programs airing on broadcast TV stations before 10 PM are subject to fine if the commission determines they are “indecent.” Shows that run in late-night, however, have a different threshold: content must be ruled “obscene” for stations to be fined. FCC defines obscene as content that “must appeal to an average person’s prurient interest; depict or describe sexual conduct in a ‘patently offensive’ way; and, taken as a whole, lack serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.”  Here’s the monologue that launched a thousand complaints:","Colbert opened his monologue by taking a shot at Trump, saying, “Boy, Mr. Trump, it’s been a busy week. First, you insult the entire city of San Juan, and then you insult the entire city of Chicago. And now, you’re insulting the entire city of Washington. I think it’s time for you to take a break and focus on something else. How about a nice game of golf? Or a nice, long walk off a short pier? Or, I don’t know, how about you just go back to being Vladimir Putin’s [expletive] holster? That’s what you’re good for.”  Colbert did pixelate the word, but the offending syllable was quickly uncovered by intrepid journalists who were determined to get to the bottom of the story.  It was a “developing story” for sure.  And now, we know that the FCC won’t be taking any action against Stephen Colbert.  
Paraphrased: The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has decided not to take any action against Stephen Colbert after he made a series of insults towards President Donald Trump on his late-night show. Colbert had criticized Trump for his recent comments towards CBS Newsman John Dickerson, and his monologue included a joke about Trump being Vladimir Putin's ""holster"". The FCC received thousands of complaints, but after reviewing the material, they concluded that there was nothing actionable under their rules. The FCC's rules state that programs broadcast before 10 PM can be fined if they are considered indecent, while late-night shows are held to a higher standard and must be considered obscene in order to be fined. Despite the controversy, the FCC has decided not to take any action against Colbert."

All she talked about in the interviews was Lion. Had Reese known that Nicole would put the show so far on the back-burner, she would have cast some random person in the show,” Daily Mail quoted a source as saying.

According to the publication, frosty relations between the pair manifested themselves at the Oscars last month. “You could cut the tension with a knife at the Oscars. Nicole was telling her people to keep Reese away from her,” claimed the source.  News of the pair being involved in “some tense arguments” during filming were also reported by the publication, which alleged that the Hollywood heavyweights may never work together again.

They’re (Reese and Nicole) great friends, they love each other and they love the way each other works.”  Another source has denied New Idea’s claims that Nicole had not been promoting the show as much as fellow cast members, saying that the 49-year-old did a ‘shed load’ of publicity both in America and abroad.

gossipcop-9075694215,1,0,"Joe Jonas soaked up the sun in Australia with a group of beautiful women, but none of them were Sophie Turner! Why is he hanging out with all of these gorgeous girls?  Joe Jonas looks like he’s having a blast on the beach! The 28-year-old was spotted surrounded by a group of bikini-clad women on Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia on Feb. 22 — but none of which were Sophie Turner. Don’t worry, though! The girls were just fans of the DNCE frontman, who graciously posed for photos with them on the sunny shoreline. How sweet!  The “Cake By The Ocean” singer went Down Under to shoot the upcoming season of The Voice Australia, which he will be a celebrity coach on, alongside Delta Goodrem, Kelly Rowland, and Boy George. While his fiancée didn’t make the trip, the couple were able to spend some quality time together before Joe’s excursion to the Southern Hemisphere. Earlier this month, the pair enjoyed a romantic getaway to a private island in the Maldives, and then followed up the vacation with a huge celebration in New York City for Sophie’s 22nd birthday on Feb. 21. Joe’s brother Nick Jonas even commemorated the occasion by giving a sweet shout-out to the birthday girl. He shared a photo from Sophie and Joe’s engagement party in Nov. 2017, and captioned the pic that also included Kevin and Frankie Jonas, “Happy Birthday @sophiet You’re super cool! We all think so!” Aww, it’s like she’s already part of the family!  You can also bet that the Game Of Thrones star wouldn’t mind her fiancé posing for photos with a bunch of beauties on the beach. On her birthday, Sophie posted a video to her Instagram story jamming out to “22” by Taylor Swift (as any self-respecting 22-year-old would do on their birthday). As you may remember, Tay and Joe used to be a ~thing~ back in 2008. But clearly, that doesn’t phase the X-Men: Apocalypse star in the slightest — nor should it. Taylor has her own Joe (Alwyn) now, and the Josie star has made it clear there’s no bad blood between them. She even came to the singer’s defense when people on Twitter questioned her inclusion in TIME‘s Person of the Year issue in December. Basically Sophie is the best, and we’re sure Joe knows that!  HollywoodLifers, are you sad that Sophie isn’t in Australia with Joe?","Or are you just happy to see him looking so happy? Let us know below!

gossipcop-1674483293,1,0,"Justin Bieber has explained to fans why he cancelled the remainder of his Purpose world tour, saying “I want my mind heart and soul to be sustainable”.  After playing 150 concerts across 40 countries during the world tour, Bieber cancelled the final 14, saying he was “just resting, getting some relaxation”. In a message on Instagram, he has elaborated on his reasons.  “I’ve learned the more you appreciate your calling the more you want to protect your calling,” he wrote. “Me taking this time right now is me saying I want to be SUSTAINABLE... so that I can be the man I want to be, the husband I eventually want to be, and the father I want to be.”  Perhaps referring to the string of fractious incidents he has been involved with, including punching a Spanish fan, driving drunk in a Lamborghini and being banned from China, he added: “Learning and growing hasn’t always been easy but knowing I’m not alone has kept me going. I have let my insecurities get the best of me at times, I let my broken relationships dictate the way I acted toward people and the way I treated them. I let bitterness, jealousy and fear run my life.!!!! ... What I’m not gonna do is be ashamed of my mistakes. I wanna be a man that learns from them and grows from them.!!”  He signed off by apologising for any grammatical errors: “I THINK THERES SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT IMPERFECTIONS!!”  With the tour now finished, the statement closes a chapter of his career. His album Purpose spawned a series of colossal hit singles, including What Do You Mean, Love Yourself, and Sorry, which until recently was the most streamed song of all time globally. It was replaced by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee’s Despacito, which Bieber also features on.  Guardian Service","Here is the paraphrased passage:

While “normal” people are pressured by friends and family to get pregnant, celebrities are pressured by the whole world. And compared to other celebs, nobody has been more publicly pressured than Jennifer Aniston. The world is obsessed with her having a baby!  MORE: JENNIFER ANISTON’S AND JUSTIN THEROUX’S DOG CUSTODY BATTLE  It seems like no one has been reported pregnant more times than Jen.The earliest reports date back to 1999, back when the world first fell in love with her on Friends and she began dating Brad Pitt. Since 1999 there have been more than 55 published articles about her being pregnant both in and outside the U.S. It was even reported by the Huffington Post that despite the possibility that the U.S would go into war “Jennifer Aniston Pregnant” was still searched more than “are we at war” on Google.  Jennifer did express in early interviews that she wanted to become a mother one day and from then on the world was waiting. The obsession with her character on Friends—and the fact that Rachel did get pregnant—could be the reason why fans kept a close eye on is she or isn’t she in real life. In fact, the roles Jennifer took on in her career often had a direct impact on when and how her pregnancy rumors evolved.  Over time the extremity of the rumors changed, but many of the triggers are the same. Rumors start any time she is wearing a loose shirt or looks “bloated,” whenever she is in a new relationship, and whenever that relationship ends. And most importantly, the rumors evolve as she ages.  MORE: JENNIFER ANISTON BANS THE WORD “BABY” AROUND HER  Take a look at almost two decades worth of pregnancy rumors and how they progressed:","2002-2003: Jennifer is dating Vince Vaughn, and she is pregnant! 2004-2005: Jennifer and Brad Pitt are married and she is pregnant! 2006-2007: Jennifer is single again and rumors of her being pregnant with Brad Pitt’s baby circulate again. 2010-2011: Jennifer starts dating Justin Theroux and rumors of her being pregnant with his baby pop up. 2012-2013: Jennifer and Justin get married and the rumors of her being pregnant again start. 2014-2015: Jennifer and Justin split and the rumors of her being pregnant again with Brad Pitt start. 2016-present: Jennifer is in a new relationship with her co-star from the movie “Office Christmas Party” and the pregnancy rumors start again.  As you can see the rumors have been consistent even though Jennifer has consistently denied them. MORE: JENNIFER ANISTON’S PREGNANCY RUMORS ARE EVEN WORSE THAN YOU THOUGHT.  In a 2016 interview with The New York Times, Jennifer made it clear that the rumors of her being pregnant are just that—rumors. She stated, “I think it’s a bit of a joke at this point. I mean, I’ve been pregnant in my career so many times. I’m just like, ‘Come on, guys. I’m not pregnant. I’m just tired’.”   According to a report by E! News, Jennifer has been asked about her pregnancy rumors so many times that she has started to lose count. The report states, “Jennifer has been asked about her pregnancy rumors so many times that she has lost count. ‘I can’t even remember how many times I’ve been asked that question,” she told E! News in 2015. “It’s like, ‘Come on guys, can we please just move on?’”  MORE: JENNIFER ANISTON AND JUSTIN THEROUX'S SPLIT IS A SAD DAY FOR PREGNANCY RUMOR FANS.  The pressure on Jennifer to have a baby is not just from the public, but from the media as well. A 2016 report by Us Weekly states, “Jennifer is under constant pressure to have a baby from her friends, family, and even the media. According to a source close to Jennifer, ‘Jennifer is constantly being asked when she’s going to have kids. It’s like, ‘Can’t she just have a baby already?’”  The report goes on to say that Jennifer is tired of the constant questioning and wants to be left alone. The source states, “Jennifer is just done with it all. She’s tired of being asked the same questions over and over again. She just wants to be able to live her life without all the attention on her pregnancy.”  The constant scrutiny and pressure on Jennifer to have a baby is not only exhausting, but also dehumanizing. It reduces her to a mere object of fascination, rather than a person with agency and autonomy.  In conclusion, Jennifer Aniston does not owe the public an explanation for her reproductive choices. She is a grown woman who has the right to make decisions about her own body and life. The constant pressure on her to have a baby is not only unjustified, but also dehumanizing. It is time to stop obsessing over Jennifer Aniston’s reproductive choices and let her live her life with dignity and respect.

Gomez’s rekindled friendship with Justin Bieber, however, had nothing to do with the rapper’s decision to end his romance with the singer.  As Gossip Cop reported, Gomez and The Weeknd recently split after nearly a year of dating. The pair weren’t seen together much during the summer, though it was later revealed the singer-actress was laying low due to a kidney transplant. Regardless, they still appeared to be going strong in the early fall. Prior to the announcement of their breakup, the status of their relationship was questioned after it emerged Gomez had rekindled her friendship with Bieber. © Gossip Cop (Getty Images)  On Sunday, that speculation swirled as Bieber and Gomez were seen in public and The Weeknd stopped following her friends on social media. That being said, Bieber was allegedly not responsible for the breakup. Rather, it was the challenges of a long-distance relationship, particularly with The Weeknd touring and Gomez’s shooting schedule, that led both the former couple to reconsider their fizzling relationship.  Additionally, contributing to their split, the rapper felt “tied down” in a relationship that had lost its spark. Over time, the pair started talking less frequently on the phone, prompting The Weeknd to end his romance with Gomez, reports TMZ. Despite their breakup, we’re told that the pair are still on good terms and have talked several times since the split.  Predictably, after the rapper ended his relationship with Gomez, Gossip Cop busted the often disproven HollywoodLife for claiming in a made-up report that The Weeknd was “heartbroken” over Gomez reconnecting with Bieber. In the bogus story, the bad blog ridiculously asserted that The Weeknd and Gomez were caught in a “love triangle” with Bieber, but of course, the breakup had nothing to do with and wasn’t caused by the “Love Yourself” singer.

Let’s see what the article had to say other than that. It said:  She has this weird sense of joy when she sees patches of cellulite on her thighs, hips and tummy. The sight of lumpy flesh doesn’t upset her. It makes her feel more feminine!  Maybe Caitlyn is trying to respect her body by respecting what she has. You can’t just disrespect your body for having a lumpy flesh. It is your body after all and if you disrespect it by yourself and obviously you can’t expect respect from others, can you? And who knows, maybe that lumpy dimpled flesh will look really feminine on her. It is creating a buzz in the media as this is not what you hear from a TV personality everyday. After all, every ordinary people might have cellulite in their body. It also said that Jenner’s view: “dimpled feminine flesh as a rite of passage into true womanhood.” and it was also reported that she wouldn’t mind having more cellulite in her body in future. The story features a zoomed-in photo of purported cellulite on Jenner’s leg. Also, after all these years of being a decathlete and going through dieting for years, the 67 year old Jenner might not want to do it anymore. “So let it be!” is what she might have been thinking. Also, the other reason maybe her daughter Kim’s cellulite pictures that surfaced online. This might just be a way to support her daughter.  Rumors or truth  This is not the only time some issues or sites posted a rumor about Caitlyn Jenner. Just last year, a issue of National Enquirer said that Jenner “wants her BIG, clunky-feet reduced to more lady-like proportions.” Again, this just a few days ago, radar online was on about exploring her sexuality online and enjoying a number of secret ‘cyber hookups’. The transgender star, Jenner has had gender reassignment surgery as well as she said she was never interested in men. There are many rumors which may include some truth about Jenner.  Short Bio on Caitlyn Jenner  Caitlyn Jenner is a decathlete turned TV personality. She is known by her previous name “Bruce Jenner”. The Olympic gold medal winner came out as a transgender in April 2015. She is the celebrity from the reality show “Keeping Up with Kardashians” along with her daughters. She has undergone a knee surgery before which she was a college football player for the Graceland Yellowjackets.

gossipcop-2116458,1,0,"MAY 02, 2017  RDR Staff  About prosopagnosia  About epidermolysis bullosa  Stay informed on the latest rare disease news and developments by signing up for our newsletter  In this week’s Hollywood gossip, it was revealed that Brad Pitt does not have a rare disease that is ‘eating him away.’Whew.However, the actor is no stranger to the rare disease community. Pitt is an honorary member of the Epidermolysis Bullosa Medical Research Foundation (EBMRF) that is dedicated to raising money and awareness for the rare skin disorder, epidermolysis bullosa.In January, Pitt introduced singer Chris Cornell during a Rock4EB annual charity to support EBMRF.Further, he revealed in a 2013 Esquire Magazine interview that he self-diagnosed himself with a rare disease – prosopagnosia — also known as face blindness. According to the article, ""Brad Pitt won't remember you. If you've met him, he'll have no idea who you are when he meets you again. Even if you've had what he calls ""a real conversation,"" your face will start fading from his memory as soon as you walk away.""It should be noted that being diagnosed with a condition and being self-diagnosed with a condition can be 2 very different diagnoses.Prosopagnosia refers to the inability to recognize familiar people from their face. They may also be unable to recognize other stimuli, such as objects, cars, or animals.People with prosopagnosia typically learn to use non-face cues including voice, walking style and hairstyle to recognize others. The underlying genetic cause of developmental prosopagnosia is not known but familial reports of this condition are consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance.Epidermolysis bullosa (aka 'the worst disease you've never heard of') is a group of devastating, life-threatening genetic skin disorders impacting children that is characterized by skin blisters and erosions all over the body.The most severe form, recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, is characterized by chronic skin blistering, open and painful wounds, joint contractures, esophageal strictures, pseudosyndactyly, corneal abrasions and a shortened life span. Patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa lack functional type VII collagen (C7) owing to mutations in the gene COL7A1 that encodes for C7 and is the main component of anchoring fibrils that attach the dermis to the epidermis.Epidermolysis bullosa patients suffer through intense pain throughout their lives, with no effective treatments available to reduce the severity of their symptoms.","Even worse, patients are at risk for developing serious infections that can be life-threatening due to their fragile skin. It is a rare disease that affects approximately 1 in 18,000 to 1 in 50,000 people worldwide.Here is a paraphrased version of the given passage:Actor Brad Pitt has been involved in supporting a rare disease community, specifically epidermolysis bullosa, through his association with the Epidermolysis Bullosa Medical Research Foundation (EBMRF). He has also spoken about his own self-diagnosis of prosopagnosia, also known as face blindness. Prosopagnosia refers to the inability to recognize familiar people from their face, while epidermolysis bullosa is a group of genetic skin disorders characterized by chronic skin blistering, open and painful wounds, and a shortened life span."
gossipcop-3530569807,1,0,"CLOSE From Trump Tower in New York City, President Trump told reporters that he believed both protesters and counter protesters were to blame for the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. USA TODAY President Trump in Trump Tower. (Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP) Corrections & Clarifications: A previous version of the story included a tweet from a parody account claiming to Jill Biden. NEW YORK CITY – President Trump's argument Tuesday that left wing groups were just as violent as the white supremacists who staged a demonstration in Charlottesville set off a firestorm of criticism from members of his own party – and raised questions about his personal views of racial tensions in the country. Just one day after Trump sought to tamp down on controversy by condemning white supremacists for their role in racially motivated clashes in the Virginia city, the president appeared to return to his highly criticized initial response that many sides were to blame for the weekend violence. ""What about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, alt-right?"" Trump told reporters in a chaotic impromptu press conference at Trump Tower. ""Do they have any semblance of guilt? What about the fact they came charging with clubs in their hands?"" Trump said he couldn't make a condemnation of hate groups earlier because he didn't ""know all the facts"" about an alleged white nationalist who crashed a car into a crowd of protesters, killing one person and wounded 19 others. CLOSE From Trump Tower in New York City, President Trump told reporters that both sides were to blame for the violence that occurred in Charlottesville, Virginia. USA TODAY ""I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct,"" Trump said from Trump Tower in New York, after an event that was intended to be devoted to a new infrastructure executive order. Trump has been especially quick to denounce previous terrorist attacks, including those taking place overseas. Yet he was notably reticent to pinpoint the blame for one on Saturday that involved white supremacists – a point his critics on both sides of the aisle continued to hammer. ""We must be clear. White supremacy is repulsive. This bigotry is counter to all this country stands for. There can be no moral ambiguity,” said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. added: ""There is only one side to be on when a white supremacist mob brutalizes and murders in America.” Several lawmakers were dismayed the president appeared to equate white supremacists with their opponents. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., tweeted: ""Blaming 'both sides' for #Charlottesville?! No. Back to relativism when dealing with KKK, Nazi sympathizers, white supremacists? Just no."" Another Republican, Rep. Charlie Dent from Pennsylvania, said Trump ""must stop the moral equivalency! AGAIN."" Over the weekend, Trump faced heavy criticism from both Republicans and Democrats for chiding ""many sides"" for their role in the violence in Charlottesville on Saturday, a statement many regarded as tepid toward racists. A full two days later, on Monday, Trump at the White House directly condemned the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists and announced the Justice Department would open up a civil rights investigation into the driver of the car that killed Charlottesville resident Heather Heyer. Yet on Tuesday, amid questions about whether Trump meant the words behind his most recent scripted statement, the president called his initial response ""fine"" and blamed the press for being dishonest in its coverage. ""There was no way of making a correct statement that early,"" he said at one point. ""I had to see the facts. Unlike a lot of reporters – I didn't know (prominent white supremacist) David Duke was there. I wanted to see the facts."" For his part, former KKK leader Duke tweeted a thank you to the president after his statement Tuesday – for condemning ""the leftist terrorists"" in Black Lives Matter and Antifa.","of Robert E. Lee is wrong. USA TODAY Trump also said he would not have called for the removal of Confederate statues if he had known they were going to be taken down. ""I would have left them up,"" he said. ""I think it's frankly disrespectful to the soldiers of the Civil War."" He added: ""I don't know if you know this, but George Washington had slaves. Does that mean he's not a great man? I mean, he was a great man. But he had slaves."" Trump was asked to respond to criticism from some Republicans, who have been quick to distance themselves from him over his handling of the Charlottesville violence. The president was unapologetic in his response. ""I don't care about their criticism,"" he said. ""I'm concerned about the country."" CLOSE At Trump Tower in New York City, President Trump defends his decision to delay condemning white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia. USA TODAY Trump also said he thinks the media is to blame for the violence in Charlottesville. ""The media is so dishonest, so corrupt,"" he said. ""They don't tell the truth. They don't tell the facts."" He added: ""The media is a big part of the problem, not the solution."" Trump was asked if he believes that the media is to blame for the violence in Charlottesville, and he replied, ""Absolutely."""

The internet has been living for the pop diva as of late since she “stole” Meryl Streep’s at the Golden Globes and singlehandedly cancelled brunch forever with a single tweet, but it’s her meme-inducing moment (the first of 2018) from her New Year’s Eve performance that has Mimi hocking merch.  In case you missed it, the pop singer pulled a *totally* MC move when she stopped in the middle of her set to request a cup of hot tea.  “I’m just gonna take a sip of tea if you’ll let me,” she said. “They told me there would be tea. Ugh. It’s a disaster — okay. Well, we’ll just have to rough it. I’m gonna be just like everybody else with NO hot tea — but we’re gonna try and do this one for you, because I just want to show my appreciation for everyone who speaks out for justice, and tries to make the world a better place.”  Twitter was overjoyed by the request, taking to their social media pages with plenty of LOL-inducing memes that even the “I Don’t” singer herself got in on, joking, “Found my tea!” with a shot of herself sipping the hot beverage.  Now, the Queen has taken things one step farther, releasing her own line of “tea” shirts (plus a commemorative mug) to mark the momentous occasion, and yes, you’re going to want one.

gossipcop-3308884181,1,0,"Beyoncé Rumored To Be Asking For Silent Delivery  As the countdown to Blueprint 1 and Blueprint 2’s arrival continues, the stories about Bey’s birth plans abound. First, we heard she planned to give birth at home, then they said her security has been running weekly drills to practice their approach to Cedars-Sinai and now there’s a report that Bey wants silence in the delivery room.  According to Naughty Gossip reports:  “Beyoncé likes peace and calm around her. She has zero time for drama and gossip. She likes her inner circle to be soft spoken if they have to talk at all. And you can expect the same will be true when she gives birth to the twins,” sources tell Straight Shuter. “You can only get into her private life if you are invited. She is very guarded and protects her privacy at all cost. She likes to be surrounded with peaceful colors and soft sounds. This will be of utmost importance for her when giving birth.”  This story is almost like opening up a fortune cookie or visiting your average storefront psychic. EVERYBODY knows Beyoncé is private. THAT doesn’t take an exclusive source to figure out.  Silent birth is a real thing though – something that Scientologists practice and Katie Holmes even did when she gave birth to Suri, but as much as Bey loves music we don’t really see her doing a silent birth.  Speaking of Bey’s love of music… Hit the flip for some recently posted pics of her from a Michael Jackson/Prince party.  GettyImages/Instagram","Your paraphrased passage is: Beyoncé Reportedly Requests Peaceful Delivery Room  As the due date for her twins approaches, Beyoncé is said to be particular about the atmosphere in the delivery room. According to a recent report, she prefers a calm and peaceful environment, with minimal conversation. This is not surprising, given her reputation for being guarded and protective of her privacy. While silent birth is a legitimate practice, it's unlikely that Beyoncé will opt for this approach, given her love of music. Recent photos of her at a Michael Jackson/Prince party further illustrate her affinity for music."

Jenner, 67, completed gender reassignment surgery in January, according to her new memoir, ‘The Secrets of My Life’. The photo shoot promises to be Caitlyn's finest hour since she first announced her transition in an interview with ABC’s Diane Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July.  Although the Kardashian-Jenner clan is said to be ‘wholly supportive’ of Jenner’s transition, sources close to the family say the prospect of a nude shoot is ‘their worst nightmare’.

Taking it to that level and unveiling her [new body] with a fully naked photo spread is going way too far.'  Kardashian momager Kris, who is said to have known about Jenner’s surgery in advance, has vowed to stop the shoot from going ahead, according to the insider.  ‘She knew the surgery was inevitable and it was bound to happen,’ said the source. ‘But she says she will do everything in her power to stop the shoot if she can.'  DailyMail.com has approached representatives for Jenner and the Kardashians for comment. Jenner's rep knew nothing about it.  Jenner first announced her transition in an interview with Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July.  The headline-making ‘I am Cait’ shoot was said to have taken the Kardashian clan by surprise at the time and led to tension between Jenner and Kim, 36, as a result.  Nevertheless, the family have been publicly supportive of her decision to transition, which was completed in January according leaked extracts from her memoir.  Jenner wrote of the $20,000 operation: 'The surgery was a success, and I feel not only wonderful but liberated […] I am going to live authentically for the first time in my life.  ‘I am going to have an enthusiasm for life that I have not had in 39 years since the Olympics, almost two thirds of my life.'  But the book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife and step-children.  Sources close to the family told DailyMail.com that Jenner’s ‘unpredictable’ behavior has also played a part in their current estrangement.  The insider said: ‘[The book] is definitely something that she’s wanted to do for a while and it was just a matter of time before she got it done.  ‘But the family were like, it’s probably going to reopen the drama of everything [that has happened].  ‘They were worried because she’s been so unpredictable lately and just trying to get out into the limelight.’  Jenner's book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife  A second leaked extract from the memoir has already proven embarrassing, after Jenner claimed the late Robert Kardashian knew O.J. Simpson was guilty of the murder of his wife Nicole Brown and her friend Ron Goldman.  Kardashian, the father of Kourtney, Khloe, Kim and their brother Rob, was part of Simpson’s defense team during his 1","995 trial.  Despite the fallout, a source close to the family said: ‘They are all still very supportive of Caitlyn’s transition and are hoping the shoot doesn’t go ahead.  ‘They think it’s going to be hurtful and embarrassing for her.  ‘They don’t want her to be seen in that light.  They want her to be seen as a respected and dignified member of the family, not someone who is going to be flashing her body all over the place.'  Jenner's rep declined to comment on the claims.

gossipcop-6742180407,1,0,"It was a humid 84 degrees in Bridgehampton on Saturday, but that didn’t stop a crowd of people from descending upon Topping Rose House for Jill Zarin’s annual luncheon. The former Real Housewife of New York, ran around the grounds in an A-line Carolina Herrera dress, posing on the step-and-repeat, taking photos with fans, and catching up with old friends. Trying to track her down for an interview turned into a scavenger hunt.  Scattered around the lawn were tables for vendors selling everything from wine to sex toys. There was a station for guests to get a vitamin infusion, with seats in the direct line of the sun transforming the spot into an inescapable sauna-I.V. drip hybrid. Housewives from across the country flew into town for the occasion (Vicki Gunvalson of Orange County and LeeAnne Locken of Dallas), which also served as a benefit for Thyroid Cancer Research in honor of Zarin’s late husband, Bobby, who died of the disease in January.  Upon first try to flag Zarin down for a couple of questions, she sent over her daughter, Ally Shapiro, in her stead. Shapiro reflected on last year’s luncheon, when her stepfather was still struggling with cancer, but encouraged her and her mother to party on.  “He loved drinking and partying. This was the highlight of his year,” she said. “It was this time last year that we were told he wasn’t gonna make it another week, and he pushed us and he said, ‘Go to the party. Maybe I won’t be here when you come back, but go.’”  Shapiro, who now lives in London while she works on her master’s degree, admits that she can’t watch old episodes of Real Housewives, which showed her as 14-year-old struggling to get close to her stepfather. “You want to think that it’s like a home movie, but it’s not. That’s not what our relationship was like,” she said, adding that the reruns play constantly in the U.K. “I’m walking down the street and someone’s like, ‘Oh my God, I just saw you trying on a prom dress!’”  She also said that her mother is dabbling with dating, specifically with a man she plays tennis with. “It’s fun, and I live in London so it’s good for her to have a distraction.”  Dina Lohan, dressed in a metallic green blazer and shorts set and a pair of oversized aviators, arrived fashionably late to the affair, but was immediately greeted by hoards of people trying to chat her up or get a photo. Eventually secured in the same spot for more than a few seconds, she was willing to talk about her daughter Lindsay’s upcoming project for MTV, a Vanderpump Rules–inspired reality show that follows Lindsay and the employees of her new Lohan Beach Club. Bunim/Murray Productions is producing the series, the same company that produced Lohan’s E! reality show Living Lohan a decade ago.  “These kids were like, babies, and now they’re running the show,” she said of the crew. “They lived in my house! And now they’re all corporate. . . . We’re home. It’s cyclical, you know.”  Lohan also revealed that the upcoming series is a bit of a family affair with Lindsay’s younger sister, 24-year-old Ali, providing the theme song.  A friend of Lohan’s interjected, asking if Ali, like her older sister over a decade ago, had moved out to L.A. for work.  “She’s in New York with me,” the matriarch answered. “I keep them close! I’m not going to lose someone to L.A., no. Not again!”  Finally, the woman of the hour managed to stop and take a breath. While Zarin may no longer be a Bravo housewife, she still knows how to schmooze like one. She’s been keeping up with the latest season of the show here and there, and even received a good-luck message from Luann de Lesseps, who checked into rehab earlier in the month, wishing her good luck on the event. Having brought me up to speed, Zarin closed our conversation with a plug for her new line of “pet-proof, gorgeous, and inexpensive” rugs, aptly titled Jill Zarin Rugs.

The 20-year-old cosmetics guru — who is expecting her first child, a baby girl, with boyfriend Travis Scott — did not appear in any photos from the bash shared to social media by KarJenner family members. But a source tells PEOPLE she was there celebrating away from the cameras.  “Kylie looked great but didn’t really draw any attention to her baby bump,” the source says. “She still acts like she wants to keep her pregnancy private.”  Meanwhile, her sister Khloé Kardashian, — who earlier this week confirmed that she and boyfriend Tristan Thompson are expecting their first child together — accentuated her own baby bump in a skin-tight, sparkly jumpsuit with a white fur coat.  “Khloé was beaming all night,” the insider says of the 33-year-old Revenge Body host. “She kept touching and showing off her cute baby belly.”  Khloé showed off her bump on Instagram as well.  “Merry Christmas!! May you sparkle and shine this festive season, may all of your wishes and dreams come true,” Khloé captioned a gallery of shots showing her touching her belly. “I pray that we all may feel this happiness all year round.

Kourtney’s ex-boyfriend Scott Disick was there, too — without girlfriend Sofia Richie.  “He mingled, looked good and didn’t drink,” the source says, adding that there wasn’t any awkwardness with Kourtney’s new boyfriend Younes Bendjima.  “Kourtney seemed so happy that Younes joined her,” the insider says. “They are so cute together. He kept bringing her drinks and doting on her. Younes fits right into the family. He didn’t seem uncomfortable that Scott was there. They said hello, but that was it.

Jan Ashley, who married the businessman after Khloe's mother Kris Jenner, said: 'Khloe is not his kid -- he told me that after we got married.'  And Ellen Pierson, 63, who married Robert in 2003 just two months before his death, has also come forward after eight years of silence to 'tell the truth' about the Kardashian family.  Claims: Two of Robert Kardashian's ex-wives have come forward claiming the lawyer told them Khloe Kardashian, left, was not his real daughter, like older sisters Kim and Kourtney  The reality star has hit back at the claims, calling them 'really low'.  In an explosive interview with Star magazine, Ashley said: 'He just kind of looked at me and said [it] like it was a matter of fact. He said ""Well, you know that Khloe's not really a Kardashian, don't you?""    'And I said… ""OK"" and that was it.'  She claims Khloe, who is married to Dallas Mavericks basketballer Lamar Odom, knew she had a different father to her sisters and younger brother Rob.  'Khloe brought it up all the time. She looked nothing like the rest. She was tall, had a different shape, light hair, curly hair. Didn't look anything like the other three children.'  Different: Khloe has often pointed out that she looks nothing like her older sisters and their mother Kris, far right, said once people asked whether she was 'the milkman's child'  Fighting back: Khloe has responded to the claims today on Twitter She said Robert, who is of Armenian descent, had told her that he and Kris were not sleeping together at the time Khloe was conceived. '[But] he never would have considered a DNA test. He loved her very much. Robert did question the fact that Khloe was his,' Ellen said. 'Any normal man would if they knew their wife had cheated on him.' Khloe has responded to the claims today on Twitter.  Daddy's little girl: Robert Kardashian, pictured with Khloe as a child, referred to having four biological children in court documents filed in 1999 She wrote: 'The audacity you have to mention my father’s name like this! Should be ashamed of urself! I let a lot of things slide but this one is really low… YOU ARE DISGUSTING! (yes you know who YOU are).'    High-profile: Robert represented O.J. Simpson in his murder trial in 1994  Kris, 56, recently admitted in her new book that she cheated on Robert during their marriage.  Since Robert's death, Ellen had experienced financial difficulties, filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2010.  The home she and Robert shared in Indian Wells, California, was sold after going into foreclosure in October.  Kris remarried Olympian Bruce Jenner in 1991 and the couple had two daughters, Kendall and Kylie.  Bruce already had four children from two previous marriages: Burt, Casey, Brody, and Brandon.    Khloe is often talking about how she looks nothing like her sisters, and Kris has been quoted as saying people asked her whether she was 'the milkman's daughter' when she was born.    On Khloe's blog in June 2010, she shared a number of pictures of her and the attorney.  She wrote: 'Father’s Day is two days away, so in preparation I wanted to post this photo album (mostly old school pics) dedicated to my dad and to Bruce.  'I was seriously the luckiest girl in the world growing up because I had two amazing dads who not only loved us kids more than anything, but adored each other as well.  'My dad and Bruce were always really cl","ued in to my feelings and what I wanted. They were always making sure I felt loved, respected, and appreciated.  'They both worked so hard to give us everything we needed and more. I am forever grateful to them for that.  'Love you guys so much!'.  She added: 'I am so lucky to have such a great dad, and I'm so lucky that he had such a great friend in Bruce.'  Khloe, who is married to Dallas Mavericks basketballer Lamar Odom, has not yet responded to the new claims.  The Kardashian family, including Khloe's siblings Kim, Kourtney and Rob, have yet to comment on the new claims.'."

gossipcop-5865271192,1,0,"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired.

Pregnant Kylie Jenner. Pregnant Kylie Jenner. Yet — Kylie Jenner, 20, has not actually confirmed she is pregnant.  For some celebrities, this would not be a big deal — some stars get pregnant and do not say a word, even as “sources” and “insiders” dish to the tabloids, as illustrated above. For someone in the Kardashian-Jenner family, this is especially confusing.  After all, these family members have become international superstars because they share nearly every detail of their lives, even the painful or uncomfortable moments. As a result, people have become inexplicably fascinated by all of them (Kris Jenner, Caitlyn Jenner, Kim Kardashian West, Kourtney Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian and Rob Kardashian), which has fueled their multimillion-dollar franchise of reality shows and sponsorships.  So the decision to keep Kylie’s apparent pregnancy under wraps is very off-brand for the family. This month, speculation will probably hit even more of a fever pitch, as February is the oft-reported due date for her baby, reportedly a girl.  The non-confirmation of the news — reported by the tabloids in September and described as a “happy” surprise for Kylie and her boyfriend, rapper Travis Scott — has sent some fans into a spiral. On Christmas Day, fans melted down when Kylie did not appear on the family’s annual Christmas card.

The tabloid is reporting that a source is saying that Taylor is the one reaching out to the actor since she feels she is now more mature than she was when they dated back in 2010.  The source said, “Taylor was so young when they dated, she wasn’t ready for a serious relationship, but now she’s showing Jake how much she’s matured. She’s excited to see where things go.”  In 2015, a rumor swirled around saying that the stars were in contact with each other, even though she was dating Calvin Harris at the time.

In June, Jake ran into Cara Delevingne at The Graham Norton Show and asked for Taylor’s new number. They’ve kept in touch, albeit secretly, ever since.""  This would all be so ironic since Taylor allegedly wrote the hit song ""We Are Never Getting Back Together"" from her Red album about the relationship after her ex's friend asked her if they were giving their relationship a second chance.  “This guy walks in who is a friend of my ex’s and starts talking about how he’s heard we’re going to get back together.

The lyrics in the track said: ""I'm really gonna miss you picking fights / And me falling for it screaming that I'm right / And you would hide away and find your peace of mind / With some indie record that's much cooler than mine.""  In the video for the song, the actor who plays the singer's love interest gives her a scarf which many thought to be a clue that revealed the song was about Jake since she had been photographed wearing one of his scarfs while they were dating.

In fact, the camera caught Jay barely acknowledge Kim when he was going on stage to accept his award with Kanye West. Since Jay and Kanye are not only music collaborators but close friends, will “Kimye” stand a chance?  Unfortunately, Kim cannot make Kanye’s friends like her.

It wasn’t so bad on the scale of celebrity breakups, but after less than three years of marriage (a lifetime in Hollywood), it was a tabloid downer for a day or two.  In case there are still people busying themselves wondering if Aniston is happy (just a note, she really doesn’t want you to), please stop. According to the latest tabloid reports, she’s doing just fine. She’s reportedly back on the dating scene with two different beaus, per Us Weekly, and her friends are having trouble not talking about it. One man is reportedly a bachelor who recently split from his wife and the other is an “industry creative,” whatever that ever means. Neither of them is an actor.  But there’s no reason to believe we’ll learn more anytime soon. In July of 2016, Aniston wrote a pretty searing op-ed for HuffPost in which she scolded paparazzi that are constantly obsessed with whether she’s in love or having babies.  “For the record, I am not pregnant,” she wrote then. “What I am is fed up. I’m fed up with the sport-like scrutiny and body-shaming that occurs daily under the guise of ‘journalism,’ the ‘First Amendment,’ and ‘celebrity news.’”  O.K., so, Jennifer Aniston is happy. She’s dating. This is great. Now time to leave her alone and talk about the fact that Justin Theroux knows someone in the South of France with a really great hot tub.

The two sparked dating rumours in 2010 and captured the hearts of both their fan bases, resulting in the #Jelena hashtag. Since Bieber and Gomez are two of the most famous young stars of their time, their admirers range from supportive to downright obsessive.

gossipcop-2388806885,1,0,"R. Kelly’s time may have finally come. R. Kelly has been accused of sexual relationships with minors going back to 1994, when he married 15-year-old pop star Aaliyah. (The marriage was annulled.) In the 24 years since then, he has been sued multiple times for inappropriate sexual contact with a minor (he settled out of court every time), and he was eventually charged with creating child pornography. (A jury found him not guilty on the grounds that they could not conclusively identify the other figure in his infamous sex tape as a child.) Last summer, he was accused of creating an abusive “sex cult” of very young women, whom he allegedly isolates, brainwashes, and abuses physically and emotionally. Since the story broke, multiple women have added their own testimonies of abuse at R. Kelly’s hands. (Through a lawyer, Kelly denied all accusations, saying he would “work diligently and forcibly to pursue his accusers and clear his name.”) And in April, another woman accused Kelly of “knowingly and intentionally infecting her with an STD.” Her lawyers say they are currently preparing a federal civil lawsuit. Through a spokesperson, Kelly issued a statement to the Washington Post in which he “categorically denies all claims and allegations.” As man after man has fallen to the #MeToo reckoning, losing jobs and retiring from public life after being accused of sexual harassment and assault, there’s been a recurring whisper: What about R. Kelly? Despite decades of lawsuits and allegations, Kelly’s career has marched steadily on. Last year, he finished an arena tour with a few cancellations. This year, he’s touring with singer Charlie Wilson (some protests are planned). His music appeared in Pitch Perfect 3. At this year’s Coachella, rapper Vince Staples repeatedly referred to Kelly as a “child molester” in an interview with Complex, insisting, “He pees on people.” In our post-#MeToo, post-Time’s Up, post-Harvey Weinstein world, and given the sheer volume of allegations against Kelly, it seems reasonable to raise the question of why he continues to work as much as he does. But Staples’s interviewer only giggled nervously and protested, “We can’t ever talk about this guy. ... You’re about to get me fired from Coachella. It’s my first time here.” Later, Staples tweeted that “R. Kelly people is looking for me.” ladies and gentlemen, vince staples on r kelly pic.twitter.com/SmZdYu9PNJ — andy (@aboynamedandy) April 16, 2018 That stasis may be starting to change. Most of the claims against Kelly were reiterated in a recent BBC Three documentary, R Kelly: Sex, Girls & Videotapes. And over the past year, at least five members of Kelly’s inner circle have left him. His assistant, his accountant, his lawyer, and his rep have all said that they no longer work for him, although none of them have gone into detail about their departures and all have been supportive and complimentary toward Kelly in their statements. His longtime musical accompanist, DJ Phantom, was less circumspect about his decision to leave Kelly in December: “I didn’t know then what I know now,” he said. “He’s a shitbag.” In April, the Women of Color committee within Time’s Up threw its weight behind the #MuteRKelly campaign, calling for anyone currently profiting from Kelly and his music to drop him, including Spotify, Ticketmaster, and Kelly’s record label, RCA. Shortly thereafter, Spotify announced that it would no longer be promoting Kelly’s music, although his music would remain in their streaming catalog. It’s possible that these new developlments mean things are changing for Kelly, and that he’s about to face lasting consequences for those accusations. But if that’s the case, those consequences took more than two decades to reach him. There is a persistent vagueness to the way we talk about R. Kelly that makes it possible to forget exactly what he’s been accused of, how often he’s been accused, and how much proof there is against him. And most likely, that’s because his alleg","by the marriage.” 1996: R. Kelly sued for sexual misconduct In 1996, a 17-year-old girl named Tiffany Hawkins filed a lawsuit against Kelly, alleging that he had sexually assaulted her when she was 16. The suit was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount. 2000: R. Kelly settled another sexual misconduct lawsuit In 2000, another lawsuit was filed against Kelly, this time by a 27-year-old woman named Kitti Jones, who alleged that Kelly had sexually assaulted her when she was 17. The lawsuit was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount. 2002: R. Kelly settled a third sexual misconduct lawsuit In 2002, a third lawsuit was filed against Kelly, this time by a 22-year-old woman named Lizzette Martinez, who alleged that Kelly had sexually assaulted her when she was 17. The lawsuit was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount. 2008: R. Kelly was charged with child pornography Kelly was charged with 21 counts of child pornography after a videotape emerged of him engaging in sexual acts with an underage girl. In 2008, a jury found him not guilty on the grounds that they could not conclusively identify the other figure in the tape as a child. 2017: R. Kelly was accused of running an abusive “sex cult” In 2017, Buzzfeed published a report detailing multiple women’s accusations that Kelly had created a cult-like environment in which he isolated, brainwashed, and abused them physically and emotionally. The women claimed that they were punished if they didn’t follow Kelly’s rules or if they tried to leave the cult. The article included allegations from several women who said they were in relationships with Kelly when they were underage. 2018: R. Kelly’s time may have finally come In 2018, the BBC Three documentary R Kelly: Sex, Girls & Videotapes was released, featuring interviews with several women who accused Kelly of sexual misconduct, including those who claimed to be underage at the time of the assaults. The documentary also included footage of Kelly engaging in sexual acts with underage girls, which was taken from the videotape that led to his 2008 child pornography charges. The documentary’s release seemed to spark a renewed wave of outrage against Kelly, with some calling for him to lose his record deal and for his music to be taken off streaming platforms. In April 2018, singer Charlie Wilson, who was touring with Kelly at the time, told Complex that he believed Kelly was a “child molester” and that he “pees on people.” In response, Kelly’s lawyer issued a statement denying all of the accusations and insisting that Kelly would “work diligently and forcibly to pursue his accusers and clear his name.”"

Here’s how the Biebs is coping with his time apart from Sel.  Justin Bieber, 24, is going through a tough time as his relationship with Selena Gomez, 25, is on pause. She’s currently on vacation with friends in Sydney, Australia, where she appears to be carefree in this new video. However, a source reveals that the same can’t be said for Bieber. “Justin has Selena on the brain constantly. He is trying to drown it out by hanging with friends and doing stuff on his own time but he keeps thinking about her,” a source EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com. “He always wants to be around her, talk to her and be with her. She is like a drug for him, he just needs more and more and more.”  As the Biebs continues to struggle with their time apart, he’s got a few things up his sleeve for when she returns to LA. “He can’t wait until she is back because he wants to really wine and dine her upon her return and really kick start the relationship back up again,” the insider reveals. It’s unclear when Sel is scheduled to return to the West Coast. But, as seen on her Instagram, she is having the time of her life. She posted a video which showed her laughing on a boat, accompanied by a subliminal message, that she “chose” to take care of herself, “not to prove anything to anyone.” Was she trying to give us insight into her most recent split with Bieber?  Jelena fans went into panic mode after seeing Sel in the arms of another man on a boat on March 19. She was photographed hugging and goofing off in photos with Sydney native, Johnny Rays. While all signs point to a friendship between the two, the photos didn’t appear that way to some fans who claimed they looked too close for comfort.  While Sel has been vacationing Down Under, Bieber has been staying active. He’s been photographed playing hockey and soccer with friends. However, his emotions may be getting the best of him as he took a gnarly fall during a soccer game on March 19, and seemingly broke down on the sidelines of a hockey game on March 17.  As you may recall, Jelena reunited in October 2017, after her split with The Weeknd, 28. They seemed inseparable, having spent New Year’s together in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. However, their romance took a rocky turn around Bieber’s birthday on March 1, according to reports.","A source told E! News that the two were “taking a break” from their relationship, just one day after Bieber celebrated his 24th birthday.  As of now, there is no official word on when Jelena will reconcile or if they will reconcile at all.  It looks like Justin Bieber is struggling to cope with his split from Selena Gomez.  A source close to the situation has revealed to HollywoodLife.com that the 'Sorry' singer is 'going through a tough time' as he tries to come to terms with their breakup.  According to the insider, Bieber is 'constantly thinking about' Gomez and is 'trying to drown it out by hanging with friends and doing stuff on his own time.'  Despite his efforts to move on, the source reveals that Bieber is 'like a drug' for him and he 'can't wait' until Gomez returns to Los Angeles so he can 'really wine and dine her upon her return and really kick start the relationship back up again.'  It's unclear when Gomez will return to the West Coast, but the '13 Reasons Why' star has been enjoying her time in Sydney, Australia, where she has been spotted laughing and having fun with friends.  While Bieber is struggling to cope with their split, Gomez appears to be in a good place, with a source telling E! News that she is 'doing great' and is 'focused on herself right now.'  As for what the future holds for Jelena, it's unclear whether they will reconcile or move on with their lives.  One thing is for sure though - Bieber is going to have to find a way to deal with his emotions if he wants to move on from his ex.  Whether it's through therapy, exercise, or just taking some time for himself, he'll need to find a way to deal with his feelings if he wants to move on.  And with Gomez appearing to be happy and carefree, it's clear that she's not looking back.  So, Bieber may have to accept that their relationship is over and start focusing on himself."

Madonna was hit with a series of “uncomfortable questions” by a judge before she was granted permission to adopt her 4-year-old twin girls from Malawi, the presiding judge said in court documents obtained by The Associated Press on Wednesday, February 8.  “The petitioner is a professional performer and I guarded myself against the danger of her merely reciting a well-rehearsed speech by asking her some rather uncomfortable questions to which she gave very candid answers,” Judge Fiona Mwale said in her ruling, explaining her reasons for approving the adoption.  After pressing Madonna, 58, to explain her intentions in adding two more little ones to her brood of four, Judge Mwale said she was satisfied that the girls would be in good hands with the Material Girl.  “There is no doubt that the petitioner can offer the infants not only the best education money can buy, but also guidance with a high likelihood of ensuring that the two infants grow to be self-sufficient adults,” Judge Mwale said, adding that she is satisfied that Madonna “is motivated by her desire to offer a home, love, protection and guidance to the infants.”  In the court documents, Judge Mwale addressed prior controversies surrounding Madonna’s adoptions in Malawi. “In determining her motives, I questioned the petitioner at length about the impact of her decision which could be construed as robbing Malawi of its most precious resource, its children,” the judge wrote.  As previously reported, Madonna filed for adoption in High Court in Malawi on January 25 but tried to keep the process under wraps until a final decision was made. (The Queen of Pop issued a statement denying her adoption to Us Weekly that same day, claiming that she was in Malawi “to check on the children’s hospital in Blantyre.”) According to the AP, she has already raised $7.5 million for a pediatric surgery ward at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, which is set to open early next year.  Madonna previously adopted son David and daughter Mercy James, both 11, from Malawi in 2008 and 2009, respectively. She is also mom to daughter Lourdes, 20, whom she shares with ex Carlos Leon, and son Rocco, 16, whom she shares with ex-husband Guy Ritchie.  Madonna’s twin girls will retain their birth names as a part of an effort to preserve their identity as Malawian nationals, the court documents said, and their father was at the January 25 court hearing with Madonna. (The twins’ mother died within a week of childbirth due to health complications.)  On Wednesday, February 8, Madonna took to social media to share the happy news. “I can officially confirm I have completed the process of adopting twin sisters from Malawi and am overjoyed that they are now part of our family,” she captioned an image of herself walking between the two little girls. “I am deeply grateful to all those in Malawi who helped make this possible, and I ask the media please to respect our privacy during this transitional time. 🙏🏻 Thank you also to my friends, family and my very large team for all your support and Love!”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!

Madonna previously adopted son David and daughter Mercy James, both 11, from Malawi in 2008 and 2009, respectively. She is also mom to daughter Lourdes, 20, whom she shares with ex Carlos Leon, and son Rocco, 16, whom she shares with ex-husband Guy Ritchie.  Madonna’s twin girls will retain their birth names as a part of an effort to preserve their identity as Malawian nationals, the court documents said, and their father was at the January 25 court hearing with Madonna. (The twins’ mother died within a week of childbirth due to health complications.)  On Wednesday, February 8, Madonna took to social media to share the happy news. “I can officially confirm I have completed the process of adopting twin sisters from Malawi and am overjoyed that they are now part of our family,” she captioned an image of herself walking between the two little girls. “I am deeply grateful to all those in Malawi who helped make this possible, and I ask the media please to respect our privacy during this transitional time. 🙏🏻 Thank you also to my friends, family and my very large team for all your support and Love!”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!

The insider tells OK! “Rob was basically a 24-hour pot smoker back in his Twilight days, but since his relationship with Twigs got serious he's scaled back on all his vices and hardly ever drinks or smokes around other people.”  If Robert drank due to being stressed with the fame of Twilight, we can only imagine what happened after those infamous photos of Kristen Stewart making out with her movie producer boss while they were still together did to him.

He doesn’t want to hang out with him, or his other hard-partying friends like Tom Sturridge or Eddie Redmayne.”  But we haven’t heard anything negative about FKA Twigs since they started dating in 2014, so it sounds like having a low-profile and more mature partner is exactly what he needed to turn his life around!",Do you think Robert will stick to his new sober lifestyle or will he return to his old ways once the Twilight fever fades?

Ricky got me good! I was so happy that I couldn’t quit smiling. My cheeks hurt!”  The 31-year-old fertility nurse met sales manager Angel on the dating app Bumble (“Ladies pick — finally it was my choice,” jokes Bischoff) last September; the couple moved in together in May.  “On our first date, we just clicked,” she says. “It was easy and that’s the way it should be.”  Still, Bischoff admits it was “nerve-wracking” to jump back into the dating scene after her painful split from Soules in 2015, nearly seven months after they were engaged. “I was still a little bit broken and trying to pick up the pieces. But from day one there was open communication with Ricky about what I had gone through.

Something as simple as a picture of Aniston with her hand on her stomach is proof enough for some tabloids that the actress is expecting a baby. Now, a new report claims that the Friends star has hired a surrogate, could there be any truth to the story?  In the new issue of Star, the tabloid features the headline, “Jen To Justin: I’ll Raise Our Baby Alone!” followed by a story that asserts Aniston wants to become a mom, and she will do it with or without her husband. The publication claims to have a source that reveals Aniston’s marriage is “on the rocks,” and she is planning to be a single mom.  ?…❤️✌️ A post shared by @justintheroux on Aug 5, 2017 at 4:23pm PDT  “Privately, she has told friends that she’s secretly gone ahead and hired a surrogate mother to carry her child to birth. And she’s vowed to raise the baby alone,” tells the insider.  But then the source says the actress is hoping to choose the right woman soon, completely contradicting the earlier quote, which is a huge red flag that something isn’t right with this claim.  But many think the tabloid story is completely false and contradictory quotes prove the story is garbage, questioning why the insider is sharing such private and secret information with a tabloid.  This is the same magazine that published a story earlier this year claiming Aniston herself was pregnant, but then didn’t mention that at all in its latest baby claims.  Aniston told Glamour magazine back in August that not only are the pregnancy tabloid stories guilty of body shaming, but they are also an invasion into a private matter between her and her husband. She said it is no one’s business whether or not she has a baby.  Jennifer Aniston went on to say that the subject of having a baby is a sensitive topic for her, and no one has the right to judge other people’s choices.

It’s not something that’s on our radar right now,” Aniston told Glamour.  Many of Aniston’s fans are now skeptical of the latest baby claims, calling the tabloid story “a bunch of nonsense” and “lies.”  Privacy is a fundamental right, and celebrities should not be hounded or bullied into making decisions about their private lives.  ?  Jennifer Aniston’s rep also dismissed the baby claims as “100 percent false.”  As of now, there is no comment from the couple themselves, and until they do, these pregnancy rumors will continue to swirl.

gossipcop-5840642713,1,1,"Sky high prices are reportedly keeping fans from buying tickets to Taylor Swift’s upcoming Reputation tour, per a story by the New York Post. Though her 1989 world tour boasted numerous sold out performances (it eventually became the highest grossing tour of 2015), it appears her considerably more expensive snake persona is a tougher sell.  Last month, her “longtime” tour promoter told Billboard, “By the time all the tickets are sold next week, I’ll be celebrating Taylor’s birthday with a cocktail in my hand and sold-out concerts all over the world.” But her birthday has come and gone, and not one date has sold out.  Reputation was the biggest-selling album of 2017 and the tour is shaping up to be far from ill-attended, so the Post’s headline, “Taylor Swift’s Reputation tour shaping up to be a disaster,” is a little much. It does, however, highlight the problems with unpredictable pricing, scalpers, and Ticketmaster in general.  The company’s “Verified Fan” program, which they would like you to believe is all about rewarding music lovers, appears to be nothing but a cash grab that takes advantage of Swift-obsessed teens with easy access to their parents’ credit card numbers. People willing to drop $50 on merch, the Post reports, could “improve [their] position in line to purchase tickets.” And, once accessible, the tickets are often too expensive for many fans.  “I paid $150 for my ticket with amazing seats for the 1989 tour,” one fan wrote. “Now for the same seats I have to pay about $500.”  Advertisement  In related news, tickets to Katy Perry’s Friday show in New Orleans are currently starting at $23.","And don’t even get me started on the prices for Beyoncé’s tour, which range from $75 to $1500.  The high cost of concert tickets has been a hot topic of discussion among fans and industry insiders for years.  The average ticket price for a live music event in the United States is now over $70.  The most expensive ticket in the U.S. is $10,000 for a Paul McCartney show.
Paraphrased: According to a recent article by the New York Post, Taylor Swift's upcoming Reputation tour is experiencing difficulty in selling out due to high ticket prices, which are reportedly keeping fans from purchasing tickets. Despite being the best-selling album of 2017, the tour is not seeing the same level of demand as Swift's previous tour. The issue of unpredictable pricing, scalpers, and Ticketmaster's ""Verified Fan"" program have been raised, with some fans expressing frustration over the high cost of tickets."

Model Eliza Cummings was seen cutting loose on the dancefloor, glass of wine in hand, before posing with the fashion pack including Alice Dellal and Henry Holland.  And rising star Sasha Lane threw some serious shapes on the dancefloor, going wild with a Sink The Pink performer.  Earlier in the evening, she had shunned the red carpet with the rest of the stars, heading straight into the main hall.  And designer Henry Holland cosied up to Sam Rollinson and Matt Richardson inside the venue.  Guests at the star-studded bash, including model Eliza Cummings, were having a blast inside the event.  And Eliza looked like she was ready to let her hair down, glass of wine in hand.  Alice Dellal and Eliza looked like they were having a whale of a time, and group shot showed off the fashion pack's cheeky side.  But Emma's behaviour has sparked a heated debate on social media, with many fans accusing her of 'diva behaviour'.  One user wrote: 'Emma Watson is a disgrace. How dare she turn up late and not walk the red carpet like the other celebrities.  She's such a diva.'  Another added: 'I used to be a big fan of Emma Watson but her behaviour tonight is just unacceptable. She's acting like a complete diva.'  A third user chimed in: 'Emma Watson's behaviour is just ridiculous. Why would she refuse to walk the red carpet and keep everyone waiting?  She's acting like a total diva.'  But others have come to Emma's defence, saying that she's entitled to do as she pleases and that she's not being a diva at all.  One user wrote: 'Emma Watson is a talented actress and she doesn't owe anyone anything.  She can do whatever she wants and she's not being a diva for refusing to walk the red carpet.  She's entitled to her own choices and opinions.'  Another added: 'Emma Watson is a grown woman and she can make her own decisions.  She's not being a diva for not wanting to walk the red carpet.  She's entitled to do what she wants.'  The debate is sure to rumble on as the fashion pack continues to buzz about Emma's behaviour at the Elle Style Awards.  And with the actress's reputation for being a strong and independent woman, it's clear that she's not afraid to speak her mind and stand up for what she believes in.  As one fan tweeted: 'Emma Watson is a true inspiration. She's not afraid to be herself and stand up for what she believes in.  She's a true role model for young women everywhere.'  via MailOnline
Here is a paraphrased version of the passage:
Emma Watson was awarded the top prize at the Elle Style Awards on Monday night, but she seemed uninterested in receiving the honour. She arrived 90 minutes late and refused to walk the red carpet alongside other celebrities, instead opting to have her photo taken in a separate room with her chosen photographer. After receiving the award, she quickly left the event alone, missing out on the lively party that followed. Emma's behaviour has sparked a debate on social media, with some fans accusing her of 'diva behaviour', while others have come to her defence, saying she's entitled to do as she pleases."

(Buchanan County Sheriff via AP) Iowa farmer Chris Soules, a former star on ABC’s “The Bachelor” who charmed reality TV viewers with his small-town life, was arrested this week after police said he fled a crash that killed a fellow farmer. Soules, 35, was charged with leaving the scene of a fatal crash, a class D felony, and could face up to five years in prison if he is convicted. The case has garnered the attention of Soules’s “Bachelor” fans as well as residents of Arlington, Iowa, where he lives, who had come to appreciate the reality TV star’s work as an unofficial Iowa ambassador and farm industry advocate. “This story is going to spread like wildfire around here and probably all over because of who he is,” Mary Jo Brown, Arlington’s city clerk, told the Des Moines Register. “Sometimes fame isn’t your friend.” Soules, who also appeared in “Dancing with the Stars” and “Worst Chefs in America,” called 911 at 8:20 p.m. Monday evening to report that he had rear-ended a tractor on a rural road north of the tiny town of Aurora, about six miles away from his home. The tractor veered into a ditch after being struck by his 2008 Chevrolet Silverado, Soules said. The tractor driver — later identified as 66-year-old Kenneth Mosher, a Vietnam War veteran — was unconscious and not breathing, Soules told the 911 operator, according to audio obtained by local media. The man had a pulse, but there was blood around his mouth, Soules said. Soules identified himself on the call, which lasted nearly six minutes, and sounded frantic. Between heavy breathing, he answered the dispatcher’s questions and took instructions. Soules told the 911 operator he did not know how to perform CPR and could be heard asking unidentified people at the scene if they could perform the lifesaving measure. The call ended abruptly after the operator told Soules law enforcement and medical first responders were on the way. “Can I, can I call you back really quick?” Soules asked the dispatcher. “Yeah, you can call me back,” she says. “Thank you,” Soules responds. Soules left the crash site after emergency responders arrived, but before deputies with the Buchanan County Sheriff’s Office were on the scene, according to authorities. Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Scott Bright told the Des Moines Register that Soules fled the scene on foot and later got into a truck. In police audio obtained by local media, a deputy told a dispatcher that Soules “took off” in a red truck. Authorities are trying to identify who picked up Soules in the truck, Buchanan County Sheriff Bill Wolfgram told the Associated Press. That person could face charges, he said. Alcohol was found at the scene and investigators are trying to determine whose it was and whether it or speed were factors in the crash. Soules was arrested about five hours after the incident and booked into the Buchanan County Jail, the Associated Press reported. He posted a $10,000 bond Tuesday morning and was released on the condition that he surrender his passport and wear an electronic monitor. During his first appearance in court, the Buchanan County assistant attorney told the judge that Soules refused to cooperate with law enforcement after they located him at his home. He “would not come out,” the attorney said, until officials obtained a search warrant, which “took hours.” Chris Soules making his initial court appearance in Buchanan County @KWWL pic.twitter.com/72bvEg0wVR — Elizabeth Amanieh (@EAmaniehKWWL) April 25, 2017 Wolfgram told the Associated Press that investigators were “running into some roadblocks when it comes to getting information” but acknowledged Soules was acting within his constitutional rights. According to court documents, Soules had several run-ins with the law in his early 20s. In 2011, he was charged three times with underage alcohol possession and pleaded guilty and paid a fine for an open container violation, reported the Des Moines R",a tropical island.

ET’s Katie Krause spoke with Brolin at the Hallmark Channel and Hallmark Movies & Mysteries winter Television Critics Association red carpet on Saturday, where he revealed that despite his decades-long romance, he still doesn't have all the answers.  “I don’t know, because nobody trains you,” he said of the secret to his and Streisand's marriage. “This is my third time -- third marriage.

That’s the way the mind works. You gotta focus.”  As for how Streisand, 75, makes him feel special, Brolin said, “I’m always welcome when I get home.

Up till tpo that moment Crazy Jo-lie had kept Brad far from Jen. Make no mistake about it. Her frantic traveling all over the place was an attempt at keeping Pitt away from her and and any other person who might think they were a friend. She can't stand anyone but her having anything to do with Pitt . Including his own family. I knew it would backfire one day. Brad what took so long????? She suffers from an extreme mental illness. She doesn't have the kids in school for the same reason.  I do believe she thought it would last. Seeing how sexy and pretty she thinks she is. A man should and would do anything she tells them to.  I am under the impression her treatment of her surrogate Holly had a sort of wake up call to Pitt as to how utterly evil she is. You can bet she dismissed her like a piece of shite. A woman who carried twins for her. Started making Brad see her game of using and abusing.  And when Jen said her and Brad talk all the time on the phone you know that was news to little miss do as I say not as I do Angelina still talks to her ex's Jo-LIE.    Guess all the years of trying to force Brad to believe Jen was a shallow no good woman has a way of catching up to one. It took this long for Pitt to see just what had truly happened. Her spells have lost the power to confuse.In Touch said she has a terrible jealous streak and can't stand Brad even looking at a woman SHE DEEMS ATTRACTIVE IN ANY WAY. WE ALL KNOW HOW MUCH FUN THAT CAN BE.    The National Enquirer  Says Brad is so happy to have a separation from her.Brad's closest friends are woman and that drives Angelina nuts she hates sharing him  He was mad she took the salt role because she had promised him she would stay at home and be a mom.  I mean you can see her doing whatever she damn well wanted to. And he went along with it. But they have twin babies and my guess is she spends very little time bonding with them. What woman would not want to be able to stay with her new little babies. Not this woman. Sick behavior for sure. And the only thing keeping Brad from making it final is the kids.  Angie be careful what you wish for. Seems like 6 kids are going to be without a mom and dad in one place. Good luck with that",". So who is the crazy one here?  Do you think there are other children in the world who have been abused. I think it is time for a special task force to deal with Angelina.  I wonder what Pitt will say when he finds out she has sold off all his clothes and jewelry. I have a feeling he will be very unhappy.  So I am sure this is why they are seperated. He wants nothing to do with a woman who is so crazy.  She is so very crazy.

She's also sold all of Brad's clothes and jewelry without his permission. Brad is happy to be separated from her and is spending time with his female friends. He's also concerned about the kids and doesn't want them to grow up without a mom and dad in the same place. It's time for a special task force to deal with Angelina's crazy behavior."

There comes a time in every couple's relationship when the question of moving in together becomes impossible to ignore. And when those two lovebirds have been stepping out for 15 months — even though they live 3,500 miles apart; he in the UK, she in Canada — it's not so much a case of 'if' as of 'when' they will settle down. So it comes as no surprise that Prince Harry, 33, and his actress girlfriend Meghan Markle, 36, are said to be house-hunting. £7.25million - North Aston Manor, Oxfordshire: This eight bedroom property, overlooking the stunning Cherwell Valley, has seven reception rooms, a spa, swimming pool and 18.2 acres with equestrian facilities. It's nine miles from Soho Farmhouse and swanky shopping centre Bicester Village, should Meghan fancy snapping up some designer bargains Prince Harry and actress girlfriend Meghan Markle were pictured together at the Invictus Games in Toronto last month Royal sources have exclusively told the Daily Mail that the royal couple are looking in Oxfordshire and are particularly interested in high-end properties tucked away in the rolling Cotswold hills. A good friend of Harry's says the Prince, whose father's residence, Highgrove House, is in the south Cotswolds, has a long-standing affection for the area, while Meghan is said to be entranced by its rustic charm. 'He is searching for a new home in the area,' the friend reveals. 'Before Meghan, he was vaguely looking in Norfolk, but didn't find what he wanted. Now, with her input, he's renewed his search.' £2million - The Old Rectory, Lower Brailes, Oxfordshire: A stunning wood-panelled property dating from the 14th century, this boasts eight bedrooms, a sun-drenched terrace and its own private lake, complete with duck house. There’s a three-bedroom coach house for guests and it’s set at the end of a no-through road. Certainly, the lush green countryside encompassing swathes of Warwickshire, Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire is a huge draw for London-dwellers eager to snap up rural boltholes. Just an hour or so from the capital, it's home (or at least a weekend retreat) to A-listers, politicians and media executives: the Camerons, Beckhams, Kate Moss, Lily Allen and Stella McCartney all have million-pound properties in the area. 'It's like a magnet,' says Sophie Gannon, of Savills Estate Agents in Banbury, Oxfordshire. 'If you get one person, you get them all.' However, Harry isn't following the crowd but listening to his heart. The Cotswolds, and specifically Highgrove, which was bought by his father's private estate in 1980, is where the Prince spent much of his childhood. It was Charles and Diana's weekend home, with 15-acre grounds and, later on, a teenage haven in the cellars of the main house, which Harry nicknamed 'Club H'. £2.95million - Fanthill, Banbury, Oxfordshire: Accessed through electric gates, up a winding driveway, this eight-bedroom house sits among 20 acres of land, so ticks all Harry’s boxes when it comes to privacy. There’s a heated outdoor pool, miniature golf course and a carp lake, where the young lovebirds could row off the private pier A local who knows the family says: 'It's not surprising that Harry would like to live where he feels at home. 'He's lived in the Cotswolds all his life and often returns to visit his father. After his mother died, it became a place of sanctuary. 'When the boys entered their teens, Charles bought several homes in the area, thinking they might want one in the future.' Ten years ago, Charles bought up properties adjacent to his sprawling estate, paying £2 million apiece for nearby manor houses and farm buildings. But sources say rather than living off his father's generosity, Harry wants to invest in a place of his own. £4.25million - Cross Hill House, Adderbury, Oxfordshire: This 10-bedroom house, surrounded by landscaped","the hustle and bustle of the capital. 'She likes a slower pace of life,' a source reveals. 'She's tired of the constant paparazzi attention and wants a quieter life for herself and her child.'
Paraphrased: Prince Harry and his actress girlfriend Meghan Markle are looking to move in together in the Cotswolds, with a £7.25 million mansion being their top choice. They are said to be 'house-hunting' in Oxfordshire and have their eyes on several high-end properties in the area.

It’s no secret that Jennifer Lopez-at 48-has a body that won’t quit and skin that needs to be studied so we can all age like the goddess she is.  Dramatic? Not even close.  And while a lot of it may be down to great genes, Lopez has revealed in a new interview some of her beauty secrets and yep, they’re as diva as you might expect.  Lopez credits her glow to positive affirmations, revealing she says one in particular to herself every day to keep her radiant, youthful look intact.  So what is this magic phrase?  “I am youthful and timeless at every age,” Lopez says every single day—but it’s not enough to just say the mantra daily, because Lopez also has a handful of pillows with these words and more mantras embroidered into them all over her home. “I tell myself that every day, a few times a day. It sounds like clichéd bullshit, but it’s not: Age is all in your mind. Look at Jane Fonda.”  Lopez continues, “The affirmations are everywhere. I forget that they’re all here. They’re just part of the house now.”  Before you scoff at Lopez’s positivity there is a school of thought that believes negative thoughts can age you. Australian-born Dr Blackburn, a Nobel Prize winner, co-authored The Telomere Effect: A Revolutionary Approach to Living Younger, Healthier, Longer, with anti-aging psychologist Dr Elissa Epel, which investigated the link between telomeres, which protect our chromosomes, and the effect stress, sleep and diet can have on telomeres and how that directly corresponds with our health.  The book asserts there is a correlation between depression and anxiety and shorter telomeres and that “when pessimists develop an aging-related illness, like cancer or heart disease, the illness tends to progress faster.”  And really there's only so far a little highlight can go, step one is all about a positive attitude. Step two is to find yourself a great pillowcase and settle on your new mantra.  So what’s the lesson here? Your inner glow is only a glass half full attitude away.","And Jenny's silk pillowcases may be the secret to her glowing skin.  No secret here, Jenny.  But really, what’s the harm in having a little positivity in your life?  Even if it is on a silk pillowcase.

She repeats a daily mantra to herself, ""I am youthful and timeless at every age,"" which she has embroidered onto multiple pillowcases throughout her home. According to a Nobel Prize-winning psychologist, Dr. Blackburn, negative thoughts can age a person, while a positive attitude can help maintain youthful health.

Each time Channing and Jenna head to mediation to discuss the terms of their divorce, “they can’t seem to agree on anything,” says a source. “Their meetings have been contentious.” One big issue: their five-year-old daughter, Everly. “They can’t agree on custody,” a friend tells In Touch exclusively.

Though Jenna, 37, has had a successful movie and TV career with shows like Supergirl, Channing, 38, has starred in several blockbusters, such as Magic Mike and 21 Jump Street, and was the family’s main breadwinner. “Jenna has told friends that she gave Channing the best years of her life,” says the source, “and now she’s trying to negotiate a very secure future for herself.”  There is a lot at stake financially. During the course of their marriage, the pair acquired several assets, including a $6 million Beverly Hills home and pricey cars including a Tesla and a vintage Chevrolet truck. Finding common ground about dividing their stuff “is not easy,” says the friend. “They both want it to be over with.”          Jenna never thought it would come to this. “She isn’t pleased about how it’s all played out so far,” says the source. “She’s bitter. There are days when she’s blaming him for not working harder to save their marriage.” And while she’s told pals that she hopes they can stay friends, adds the source, deep down “she knows that’s never going to happen.”  Channing shouldn’t underestimate Jenna, says the source: “She’s looking out for herself, and at the end of the day she knows that he’s got to pay.

From “cool pants” to clover emojis, there’s a lot of backstory that needs explaining in order to completely understand everything that went down among Kanye West and Wiz Khalifa and Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna. To keep you informed, Us Weekly has broken it down with a comprehensive timeline of events. Kanye West Dates Amber Rose In 2008, the Grammy-winning rapper started a relationship with unknown model Rose after spotting her in Ludacris’ “What Them Girls Like” music video. The pair had a public two-year romance. Amber Rose Breaks Up With Kanye West In mid-2010, Rose called things off with West. A year after the split, Rose appeared on The Wendy Williams Show, noting, “[Kanye] said that he was an a-hole and he was mean to me and he didn’t treat me the way he was supposed to. I accepted his apology because I feel like he’s remorseful for how he treated me.” Blac Chyna and Tyga Have a Son, Get Engaged Meanwhile, an up-and-coming rapper named Tyga welcomed a baby boy named King Cairo Stevenson with his then-girlfriend, model Blac Chyna, in October 2012. “Most amazing feeling ever. #Blessed #2Kings,” Tyga captioned a Twitter photo cradling his little boy. That December, the couple confirmed they were engaged in an Instagram post featuring Chyna’s giant diamond ring. Kanye West Starts Dating Kim Kardashian Fresh off his split from Rose, West set his sights on his longtime friend and crush Kim Kardashian in early 2012. The pair were spotted out together and Kardashian’s famous family even started pressing the reality star for details on her new romance (remember when he let her borrow his car?!). Kanye West Raps About Wiz Khalifa, Amber Rose As West’s romance with Kardashian blossomed, so did that of his ex Rose and her new rapper fiancé, Wiz Khalifa. In April 2012, West released the song “Cold” in which he rapped, “Only n—a I got respect for is Wiz / And I’ll admit, I had fell in love with Kim around the same time she had fell in love with him.” Amber Rose Marries Wiz Khalifa After Welcoming Son Sebastian In February 2013, Rose and Khalifa had their first child, son Sebastian, announcing the news on Twitter. In July 2013, the couple secretly wed; the next month, they had a big ceremony in which Rose wore a stunning Pnina Tornai for Kleinfeld gown. She didn’t share photos from the private event until their one-year anniversary. North West Is Born Following a difficult pregnancy, Kim gave birth to her daughter, North West, in June 2013. West penned the song “Only One” for his little girl.

Kanye West Marries Kim Kardashian After gracing the cover of Vogue in wedding couture, the A-list couple tied the knot in an elaborate European wedding weekend that began in Paris and ended with an Italian ceremony in May 2014. Rob Kardashian Skips the Wedding, Remains Under the Radar Things got awkward when Kim’s younger brother, Rob Kardashian, left Kim’s wedding festivities early. His exit followed months of erratic behavior: avoiding appearances on the family’s reality series, Keeping Up With the Kardashians, significant weight gain and depression. He’s stayed out of the public eye ever since. “He sent me a long email the morning of [saying] that he was going to leave,” Kim later said on Watch What Happens Live. “There was no fight.” Blac Chyna and Tyga Split In August 2014, the parents called it quits. “They are trying to keep it amicable,” ","17,” Khloé tweeted. “I was a stripper since I was 15 years old. 💁‍♀️💄💋 #TeamKhloe 😘.” Blac Chyna and Kim Kardashian Settle Their Feud In January 2016, Chyna posted a photo on Instagram of her and Kim hugging, captioning it, “New year, new beginnings.” The pair had been at odds for months following a series of explosive feuds that played out on social media and in Us Weekly. North West Is Born In June 2013, Kim gave birth to her daughter, North West, and in the immortal words of Hilary Duff, “Let’s go back, back to the beginning.” January 2016 played host to a series of Kardashian-Jenner-West-Rose-Chyna feuds that have been years in the making."

Fans believed he had taken the picture.  Cheryl - who is living at their £5.6million country home in Surrey - did not publicly respond to his message.  A source told MailOnline: 'Cheryl basically went into hibernation when she got pregnant and has made the decision to be a stay at home mother with no nanny and is looking after bear herself. She doesn’t like going out much as she used to.'  Fans have recently questioned why the couple have not been pictured on social media together since August last year.  Fans of the couple are concerned that they haven't been pictured together since August  The last time they were seen in public was at The X Factor last October.  A friend Cheryl said: 'The fact of the matter is, like most young couple's with busy work lives and the demands of an infant they have been struggling to spend time together.

gossipcop-9639077061,1,0,"Ivanka Trump is becoming one of the most powerful first children in American History – despite not having an official job in the Trump administration. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) Ivanka Trump’s products weren’t always the hottest items online. In January, for instance, the first daughter’s fashion line ranked No. 550 based on the number of orders from Lyst, the biggest fashion e-commerce website in the world, according to Forbes. That changed dramatically the following month. Sales of Trump’s products skyrocketed in early February, making her Lyst’s 11th most popular brand. The biggest spike, according to Lyst, came on Feb. 9, when sales jumped by 219 percent from the day before. Yes, Feb. 9 — the same day that White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted Trump’s clothing and jewelry line on “Fox & Friends.” “Go buy Ivanka’s stuff is what I would tell you,” Conway said. “I’m going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody.” And viewers did, apparently. Sales of Ivanka Trump’s branded products skyrocketed on Feb. 9, the same day White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted the line on Fox News. (Lyst) Abigail Klem, president of the Ivanka Trump brand, said in a statement that “the beginning of February” shows “the best performing weeks in the history of the brand.” “For several different retailers, Ivanka Trump was a top performer online, and in some of the categories it was the best performance ever,” Klem said. Sarah Tanner, Lyst’s spokeswoman, said increases in sales are usually tied to current events. For instance, interest in pantsuits went up by 460 percent last year because of Hillary Clinton’s affinity for the style, she said. Sales of the first daughter’s products went up by 86 percent in November when her father won the presidential election, according to the company. Conway has come under fire for touting Ivanka Trump's clothing line during a televised interview. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) [A Trump wine boycott backfires spectacularly] But the brand was “largely featured” in the news in February, Tanner said. Conway gave her on-air endorsement of Ivanka Trump’s brand after President Trump had complained on Twitter that his daughter had “been treated so unfairly” by the department store Nordstrom, which dropped her clothing line over slow sales. “It would not be a surprise to us if it resulted in the increase in sales,” Tanner said of Conway’s Fox interview. “I think that’s one of the reasons the brand was largely in the news and could have attributed to this increase.” Conway did not respond to an email requesting comment. Her promotion of the fashion line appeared to violate an ethics rule barring federal employees from using their public office to endorse products and immediately drew criticism from both Democrats and Republicans. [Where does the Ivanka Trump brand go from here?] Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said Conway’s comments were “absolutely wrong, wrong, wrong” and “clearly over the line,” The Washington Post reported. The White House later said that Conway had been “counseled.” But concerns about her comments remain. On Thursday, the government’s top ethics official criticized the White House for not disciplining Conway, The Post’s Drew Harwell reported. Walter M. Shaub Jr., director of the Office of Government Ethics, had urged officials last month to reprimand the White House counsel but was rebuffed. On Thursday he wrote to Stefan C. Passantino, who handles White House ethics issues as the president’s deputy counsel. “When an employee’s conduct violates, disciplinary action serves to deter future misconduct,” Shaub wrote. “Not taking disciplinary action against a senior official under such circumstances risks undermining the ethics program.” [A Trump voter’s message to retailers: ‘Keep your mouths shut about our president’] Last month, a group of law professors filed a professional misconduct complaint against Conway — a","Ivanka Trump’s fashion line, which has been sold at retailers such as Amazon, Macy’s, Lord & Taylor and Zappos, is no longer available on those sites. The brand’s website still lists items, but there is no information about when or if they will be restocked. (Tanner said company policy prohibits her from sharing the actual numbers of online sales.) Lyst found that “Ivanka Trump” was the most searched fashion term on its platform during the first week of February, surpassing “Manchester United” and “Lady Gaga.” The brand has been a top 100 fashion brand on Lyst for the past two months, according to the company. In a statement, Klem said that the brand’s sales have been on the rise since January, with February being the best performing month yet. She attributed the boost to a combination of factors, including a strong product offering and increased interest in the brand. (Klem declined to provide specific sales figures.) “We are thrilled with the customer response and we are working hard to meet the increased demand,” Klem said. Ivanka Trump’s brand has been in the news lately for a number of reasons, including her father’s controversial immigration order and her role as a senior White House adviser. (Klem declined to comment on the ethics concerns surrounding Conway’s endorsement of the brand.) The brand has also faced a backlash from some consumers who are boycotting Trump products in protest of the president’s policies. (The Grab Your Wallet campaign has encouraged shoppers to avoid retailers that stock Trump-branded products.)

Jennifer Holliday is backing out of performing at Trump's inauguration celebration after receiving backlash from her fans. Kareem Quow for KQ Photography  Holliday, best known for her Tony-winning role in Broadway's ""Dreamgirls,"" faced pressure from her gay, lesbian and black fans when it was announced she would sing at a Thursday concert at Washington's Lincoln Memorial.  Holliday said in a statement Saturday that she apologized for her lapse of judgment, for being uneducated on the issues and causing heartbreak for her fans.  Several prominent entertainers have declined to perform at Trump inaugural festivities. Country star Toby Keith and actor Jon Voigt are in the lineup for Thursday's concert.  Holliday's reversal was first reported by The Wrap; the publication obtained a letter Holliday wrote to her fans. Her representative, Bill Carpenter, confirmed the details in the letter to The Associated Press.  ""My only choice must now be to stand with the LGBT Community and to state unequivocally that I WILL NOT PERFORM FOR THE WELCOME CONCERT OR FOR ANY OF THE INAUGURATION FESTIVITIES!"" she wrote.  ""Please know that I HEAR YOU and I feel your pain. The LGBT Community was mostly responsible for birthing my career and I am deeply indebted to you,"" she added. ""You have loved me faithfully and unconditionally and for so many years you provided me with work even though my star had long since faded.""

The performer, who most recently starred on Broadway in ""The Color Purple,"" said she was hurt by the angry backlash, which included calls to boycott her music. Others called her ""Uncle Tom"" and there was even a suggestion that she take her own life.  ""It just really made my heart drop to my feet,"" Holliday said.

But Trump has insisted that's how he wants it, saying the swearing-in festivities should be about the people, not the A-list stars.","Holliday's decision is the latest in a series of high-profile withdrawals from Trump's inaugural events.

gossipcop-2194660040,1,1,"First Lady Melania Trump claims there is a secret poisoner in the White House and fears her husband is being slowly poisoned with “heavy sedatives” smuggled into his drinks in an attempt to slow him down, control him, and discredit his presidency, according to reports.  While public debate rages about Donald Trump’s health, Melania has told friends and associates that the once robust and high energy man she knew and loved has been replaced with a “slower, damaged version”.  “By 8pm he is slurring,” she said. “This is not the man I know.”  Fearing that the sedatives are being pumped into the body of the POTUS via Coca-Cola that he orders by pressing a button he had installed on the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, Melania has insisted he stop drinking from the tap and instead revert to drinking from cans she brings herself.  “Donald’s heath improved out of sight when he stopped drinking from the tap,” Melania said.  However the First Lady fears the active campaign to poison the president is “a high level operation” and “not the work of a solitary loon.”  Melania is popular in the White House—as she is with the rest of the country—and she has befriended senior intelligence agency staff who remain loyal to president. They have educated her about Ronald Regan’s poisoning by the Deep State after his assassination attempt in 1981. They have also warned her that George W. Bush was reduced to a “brain damaged” state after years of steady poisoning.  But the advantage Trump may hold over his GOP predecessors in the Oval Office is that he has a wife who is wise to the ruse and is insisting he watch his food and drink intake closely for signs of adulteration.  Donald Trump’s food choices say a lot about the man. The president’s Howard Hughes-level pickiness when it comes to food is partly motivated by a desire to avoid being poisoned, according to Melania. He doesn’t trust those around him – and rightfully so.  As President Trump knows all too well, there are enemies of the state dug in deep at the White House.  Reporters from TIME recently got a glimpse behind-the-scenes at the White House, where they reported on what goes down at the president’s dinner table. Of particular interest was a meal enjoyed by the reporters, Trump, and Vice President Pence.  Pence’s meal was not unusual—he ate what everyone else did. But the POTUS received a meal fully customized to his own preferences, and closely observed by Melania who insisted on watching the chef prepare the meal with ingredients she provided herself.","“I don’t want any mistakes,” she said.  And for good reason.  As the First Lady sees it, the Deep State is targeting her husband and she intends to be there to protect him every step of the way.
Paraphrased:
First Lady Melania Trump believes there is a secret poisoner in the White House who is slowly poisoning her husband, President Donald Trump, with heavy sedatives. She has noticed a significant change in her husband's behavior, stating that he is now slower and less energetic than he used to be. Melania has taken measures to protect her husband's health by ensuring that he drinks only from cans she brings herself, rather than from the tap. She has also befriended senior intelligence agency staff who are loyal to the President and has learned from them about past instances of political figures being poisoned, including Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. Melania is determined to protect her husband and is closely monitoring his food and drink intake for any signs of adulteration."

The action star has steadily starred in film after film, yet has been at the center of several dating rumors.  As the International Business Times reports, “The actor was mistakenly linked to an Australian journalist and then was associated to his Mission: Impossible 6 co-star and Crown actress Vanessa Kirby.”  All rumors until now have been stamped out as false.  However, the latest claims include those stating that members of the Church of Scientology have once again been playing matchmaker for the Top Gun star and that Cruise has reportedly been secretly dating over the past little while. Interestingly enough, Tom has reportedly been using a disguise to enjoy dates with the ladies, much like Katie Holmes did in the initial stages of her romance with Jamie Foxx.  A source told the publication about Cruise’s tactics to keep his love life out of the spotlight.  “Tom’s back on the dating scene, but nobody knows it’s him. His face is way too recognizable for him to stroll into the bars, so he has his makeup artist create a silicone mask. Seems like Tom took his Mission: Impossible role to heart. It’s just what Ethan Hunt would do in the movies.”  It’s also been claimed that the disguise, which includes makeup, takes a full five hours to apply. If this rumor all sounds a little far-fetched, that’s because it is completely untrue, according to Gossip Cop. Tom Cruise does not go through some elaborate process to secretly step out on dates. In fact, there has not been any confirmation that Tom Cruise has dated anyone since Katie Holmes.  Alberto E. Rodriguez / Getty Images  Katie Holmes, however, continues to attempt to keep her romance with Jamie Foxx a secret, despite the fact that the pair has been spotted on numerous occasions over the past year on beach getaways and romantic locales like Paris.

In this paraphrased version, some of the repeated words and phrases, such as 'sexually suggestive', 'looks like', and 'cannot actually see', have been removed. Additionally, the phrase 'someone tried to set Kevin up' has been changed to 'Kevin is dealing with a potentially embarrassing situation'. By paraphrasing the passage in this way, we have created a more varied and unique set of words, which can help to improve the overall quality of the text."
gossipcop-2161541420,1,0,"Kate Hudson Net Worth: Kate Hudson is an American actress who has a net worth of $38 million dollars. Born Kate Garry Hudson on April 19, 1979, in Los Angeles, California, US, she came to prominence in 2001 with her incredible turn in Almost Famous. This role not only made her famous, but it also fetched her a Golden Globe and several nominations, including a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Being a daughter of American actress Goldie Hawn, Hudson bears more than a passing resemblance to her famous mother in both looks and onscreen vivacity. She got the chance to showcase her talent in 1996, when she made her TV debut on Fox's TV series Party of Five (1994-2000). Although she only appeared in one episode titled ""Spring Breaks: Part 1"", this initial experience was enough to uphold her determination to develop a professional acting career in Hollywood. However, it was in 1999 that she started to attract public attention when critics lauded her brilliant portrayal of Cindy in ""200 Cigarettes"", even though the movie itself was a commercial disappointment. Onwards, her career experienced a significant advancement, especially after she managed to obtain a supporting role in ""Gossip"" and ""Dr T and the Women"" which both came up in 2000. While her accolade-worthy performance in Cameron Crowe's Almost Famous indicated that she was set to follow her mother in taking the film industry by storm. In the midst of a whirlwind schedule of fashion shoots and awards shows, she made an appearance in the romantic war drama The Four Feathers in 2002. Turning out to be a box-office failure, Hudson fired back with the surefire hit as she starred opposite quirky heartthrob Matthew McConaughey in the romantic comedy How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003). She continued to establish herself as a fully-fledged actress starring in subsequent productions like Raising Helen (2004), The Skeleton Key (2005), You, Me and Dupree (2006), Fool's Gold (2008) and Bride Wars (2009). As of most recent, she could be seen in the musical comedy-drama television series Glee as Cassandra July.","()

gossipcop-4810536767,1,0,"It seems Blake Shelton may have a thing or two to learn about karma himself.  Last week, Shelton caused an uproar when he sent a cryptic tweet about ""karma"" just as reports claimed that his ex-wife Miranda Lambert was dating a married man.  ""Been taking the high road for a long time.. I almost gave up. But I can finally see something on the horizon up there!! Wait!! Could it be?! Yep!! It’s karma!!"" Shelton tweeted after multiple outlets reported Lambert began dating married Turnpike Troubadours front man, Evan Felker.  But according to Lambert's ex-boyfriend Jeff Allen, Shelton is not as innocent as he's trying to seem.  Allen tweeted and deleted a post calling out Shelton for romancing Allen's then-girlfriend Lambert while Shelton was still married to his first wife, Kaynette Williams, in 2006.  ""You know, I’ve always given you the benefit of the doubt and chalked it up to just being human, but you must be one arrogant SOB to pop off something like this, when I know damn good and well you were cheating on your wife and Miranda was cheating on me when you two started up,"" Allen wrote in a since-deleted tweet, according to Us Weekly.  ""I kept my mouth shut for 13 years. Sorry, his karma tweet rubbed me wrong. All of this is pointless,"" he added.  Allen told RadarOnline.com, ""I’m sure Miranda did [Blake] dirty just like she did me, but he wasn’t thinking about me when he was cheating with her, so I don’t know why he thinks it's karma.""  He added that he does not harbor bad feelings toward Lambert and said she ""was a loving, caring person and a good girlfriend.""  Reps for Lambert and Shelton did not return Fox News' requests for comment.  It's been reported that Lambert and Shelton's romance began as an affair but both singers have denied this in the past. They became engaged in May 2010 and married a year later in Texas. The country singers announced their divorce after four years of marriage in July 2015.  The ""Tin Man"" singer, who recently ended things with her boyfriend of two years, Anderson East, reportedly began seeing Felker when his band joined Lambert's ""Livin’ Like Hippies"" tour in January.  Felker married global strategist Staci Nelson in September 2016. The singer filed for divorce on Feb. 16 while Nelson filed 12 days later.  Nelson, who still goes by her married name on social media, shared a tearful selfie on Thursday with the caption, ""PSA: If Staci Felker can make it through this week, so can you.""","According to a source close to Lambert, the country singer ""is devastated"" over the news of her ex-husband's alleged infidelity and ""is not in a place to be messing around with someone else's husband.""  ""Miranda is taking time to focus on herself and her own healing,"" the insider told Fox News.  ""She doesn't want to be in a relationship right now and she definitely doesn't want to be with someone who is already taken.""  So it seems like karma may be coming back to bite Blake Shelton after all.  As for Lambert, it seems like she's taking a break from love and focusing on herself after her recent breakup with East and her ex's cheating scandal.  Do you think Blake Shelton will ever learn his lesson when it comes to cheating?  Or will he continue to be blinded by his own ego?  What do you think?   Please paraphrase the given passage in 200-300 words."

gossipcop-6048462622,1,0,"Some reports suggest Ben Affleck and girlfriend Lindsay Shookus' relationship may have been going on even while they were still married to their respective spouses. A source tells ET that Affleck first saw Shookus while he was still married to Jennifer Garner, and Shookus was married to Kevin Miller -- a fellow Saturday Night Live producer. According to the source, Affleck and Shookus were seeing one another as far back as late 2014, months before news broke that he had an alleged fling with his children's nanny, Christine Ouzounian. Affleck's reported dalliance with the nanny happened in the summer of 2015, and was short-lived, our source says. However, a source close to 44-year-old Affleck disputes that the actor and Shookus got together while both were married, although the two were friendly. The source says the two got romantic after his separation from Garner in 2015. WATCH: 6 Things We Know About Ben Affleck's New Girlfriend Lindsay Shookus Let's take a look back at Affleck and Shookus' alleged relationship timeline. 2013: According to People, Affleck and Shookus started seeing one another in 2013, two years before Affleck and 45-year-old Garner announced their separation. Affleck last appeared on SNL in May 2013. Interestingly enough, Garner made an appearance during Affleck's monologue at the time, to celebrate the actor hosting the show for the fifth time. The two joked about Affleck's Best Picture acceptance speech for Argo at the Oscars, in which he said that his and Garner's marriage took ""work."" Affleck publicly thanked Garner for all her support onstage, and the two sweetly shared a kiss. One month later, eyewitnesses reportedly spotted Affleck and Shookus looking flirty at The Heat premiere after-party in NYC. ""He definitely looked interested in her,"" a partygoer told People at the time. The two later left together with other friends and headed to the nearby Mandarin Oriental hotel bar. Over the years, their relationship allegedly continued, though a source close to Affleck says the two did not get romantic until after his separation from Garner in 2015. Affleck and Shookus ""full-on had an affair,"" claims a source cited by People. ""They would fly back and forth, but he would mostly visit her in New York. They didn't hide."" ""Both of them were married at the time. They were having secret rendezvous every time he came in to New York City and other places, too,"" claims a second source the magazine quotes. ""Both of them were cheating on their spouses so they were very careful about it,"" the source alleges. X17online.com According to Us Weekly, the romance began just a few months after Shookus became a mom to her daughter with Miller. ""[Affleck and Shookus] were sleeping together, sending each other cute texts and meeting up whenever they could,"" an insider close to Garner and Affleck reportedly claims to the outlet. 2015: According to Us Weekly, Garner and Miller found out about the Affleck and Shookus' alleged relationship at the same time in 2015. ""They were devastated when they found out about the affair,"" a source claims according to the magazine. However, a source close to Affleck tells Us Weekly, ""Lindsay was not what led to the end of their marriage. They had a ton of other problems."" June 2015 -- Affleck and Garner separate Affleck and Garner announced their split on June 30, 2015.

A new report claims now that they’re both single, ‘the door is open’ for them to take things to the next level.  Is there a new celebrity romance brewing? A new report from OK! is claiming that things might start heating up between Robert Pattinson, 32, and Sienna Miller, 36. The two actors “have been close for years,” an insider tells the magazine, adding that “they’ve always had a great connection, but one of them was always with someone else, so it stayed platonic.” However, both of them aren’t currently seeing anyone now. “Now that they’re both single, the door is open for them to give this a real shot,” the source continued.  As for the pair’s friends, they reportedly think that these two would work really well together. “All of their mutual friends think Rob and Sienna would be a good match,” the insider said. Rob and Sienna have always seemed pretty close. While promoting their film, The Lost City Of Z at the Berlin International Film Festival in Feb. 2017, the pair looked comfortable together while posing for photos and grabbing dinner together.  This would definitely be an interesting match though considering Sienna is the one who set the Twilight star up with his ex-fiancée FKA twigs. A source told E! News in 2014 that Rob, Sienna and her now ex-fiancé Tom Sturridge all went to the singer’s concert together. The Remember Me actor ended up falling in love with Twigs’ music, and the couple introduced the two of them.  HollywoodLife reached out to Rob and Sienna’s reps for comment.","No word back yet.
Paraphrased passage:
Robert Pattinson and Sienna Miller are reportedly getting closer after both of them recently became single. According to a source, the two actors have a long-standing connection, but one of them was always in a relationship, so they never pursued anything romantic. However, now that they're both available, there's a chance they could take their friendship to the next level. The source added that their mutual friends think they would make a good match. Pattinson and Miller were spotted together at a film festival in 2017, looking comfortable and friendly. This potential romance is interesting given that Miller set up Pattinson with his ex-fiancée, FKA twigs."

gossipcop-7885025406,1,0,"More than a month has passed since Matt Lauer was fired from the Today show, and his former longtime colleague, Katie Couric, is now opening up about the former NBC anchor’s shocking dismissal.  “The whole thing has been very painful for me,” Couric, 61, tells PEOPLE. “The accounts I’ve read and heard have been disturbing, distressing and disorienting and it’s completely unacceptable that any woman at the Today show experienced this kind of treatment.  “I had no idea this was going on during my tenure or after I left,” she continued. “I think I speak for many of my former colleagues when I say this was not the Matt we knew. Matt was a kind and generous colleague who treated me with respect. In fact, a joke I once made on late-night television was just that, because it was completely contrary to our brother-sister relationship. It’s still very upsetting. I really admire the way Savannah [Guthrie] and Hoda [Kotb] and the entire Today show staff have handled a very difficult situation.”  The late-night show joke that Couric refers to is when she said on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen in 2012 that Lauer “pinches me on the ass a lot.” A clip of the comment made the rounds online in the wake of Lauer’s firing.  Couric spent 15 years co-hosting NBC’s Today show with Lauer, 60, but left in May 2006 to anchor the CBS Evening News.  NBC/Getty  Lauer was fired at the end of November by NBC News after the network received a “detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior,” with reason to believe “this may not have been an isolated incident.” Women have also anonymously accused him of sexual harassment and assault in reports published by Variety and The New York Times.  Following his firing, which was announced live on Today by Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb, Lauer addressed the original allegations in a statement.  “There are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions,” he said, in part. “To the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry. As I am writing this, I realize the depth of the damage and disappointment I have left behind at home and at NBC.”  Although her PEOPLE interview is the first time Couric has spoken in detail about Lauer’s exit, she briefly broke her silence about the scandal on social media in December.  In a short response to an Instagram user, who called Couric out for not publicly addressing the scandal, the veteran journalist said, “It’s incredibly upsetting and I will say something when I’m ready to. Thanks for your interest.”  RELATED VIDEO: Women of Hollywood Attend Golden Globes Together in Support of the Time’s Up Movement  The claims against Lauer came as hundreds of women and men — including Rose McGowan, Ashley Judd, Terry Crews and Anthony Rapp — have publicly came forward about alleged sexual misconduct at the hands of powerful men in Hollywood, including Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey.  The movement inspired the new Time’s Up initiative and legal defense fund that was created to help victims of sexual misconduct pursue legal action against their perpetrators. Time’s Up was a major focus at this year’s Golden Globes, where almost all the famous attendees wore black to raise awareness about the cause.  “I think it was really moving to see so many women support each other and demand change, not only for themselves, but for mistreated and marginalized women in all kinds of industries,” Couric tells PEOPLE about Time’s Up. “Clearly we are witnessing a sea change and a long overdue course correction.”  She also said that one of the new of the episodes of her upcoming six-part documentary Nat Geo series will focus on harassment women have experienced in their workplaces.  “One of my Nat Geo episodes explores the various obstacles that are holding women back in Hollywood, Silicon Valley and beyond,” she says. “I just interviewed Elisabeth Moss about this. Harassment is just one part of the equation.”  RELATED VIDEO: Hoda Kotb and ","Savannah Guthrie Address Matt Lauer’s Firing During Today Show Segment  Couric also addressed the #MeToo movement in a recent interview with The New York Times, saying, “I think it’s a moment of reckoning, and I think it’s a moment of change.  “I think it’s a moment when women are being heard and believed, and that’s a powerful thing.”  In the interview with PEOPLE, Couric emphasizes that she did not know about Lauer’s behavior during her time at the Today show, but she believes that the culture at the time may have allowed it to happen.  “I think there are a lot of factors that contribute to this problem, and it’s not just one person or one industry,” she says.  “It’s a societal problem, and it’s going to take all of us to solve it.”  Couric, who has been a vocal advocate for women’s rights, says that she is proud of the women who have come forward about their experiences of sexual harassment and assault.  “I think it takes incredible courage to speak out, and I think it’s important that we all listen to their stories and take them seriously,” she says.  “It’s not about blaming the victim, it’s about creating a culture where everyone feels safe and respected.”  Couric also shared her thoughts on the current state of politics, saying that she is worried about the impact of the Trump administration on women’s rights.  “I think the current political climate is incredibly challenging for women, and I think it’s important that we all stand up and fight for our rights,” she says.  “It’s not just about reproductive rights, it’s about equal pay and protection from harassment and assault.  It’s all of those things and more.”  As for how she thinks the Time’s Up movement will evolve in the future, Couric says that she is hopeful that it will continue to gain momentum.  “I think it’s a movement that’s only just beginning, and I think it’s going to take all of us working together to create real change,” she says.  “I think we’re seeing a shift in culture, and I think it’s a positive thing.”  In conclusion, Katie Couric has finally opened up about Matt Lauer's shocking firing from the Today show, expressing her disappointment and sorrow over the allegations against him. She also shared her thoughts on the #MeToo movement and the Time's Up initiative, emphasizing the importance of creating a culture where everyone feels safe and respected. Couric, who has been a vocal advocate for women's rights, believes that it will take all of us working together to create real change and sees the current movement as a positive shift in culture."

But the male player ranked 701 in the world - Dmitry Tursunov - believes he could beat her.  Speaking to US radio station NPR, seven-time Grand Slam champion McEnroe said of former world number one Williams, who has won an Open-era record 23 Grand Slams: ""If she played the men's circuit she'd be, like, 700 in the world.""  He qualified the comments by saying: ""That doesn't mean I don't think Serena is an incredible player, and I suppose anything's possible; maybe at some point a women's tennis player can be better than anybody.""  But he added: ""I just haven't seen that in any other sport, and I haven't seen it in tennis. If she had to just play the men's circuit, it would be an entirely different story.""  Williams later responded on Twitter: ""Dear John, I adore and respect you but please please keep me out of your statements that are not factually based.  ""I've never played anyone ranked ""there"" nor do I have time. Respect me and my privacy as I'm trying to have a baby. Good day sir.""  Williams, 35, won her 23rd Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in January. It later transpired she was pregnant at the time  'She is pregnant, and I'm not'  Tursunov, 34, was once ranked as high as 20th in the world.  The Russian told BBC World Service Sport he did not think McEnroe was ""trying to talk women's tennis down"" but said ""the reality"" was that ""men are stronger in general"".  ""I would hope that I would win against Serena,"" he added.  ""It would be a similar argument to: who would run faster, the fastest woman or the fastest man? Tennis is becoming more and more a physical sport, so it's going to be hard for a woman to beat the men.  ""It's not black and white, there are lots of factors to take into account. Physically I might not be in the best shape of my life but as an overall package I'm much better than my ranking would suggest. She is pregnant, and I'm not.  ""I've never heard John say anything absolutely stupid - he knows his stuff. What he said about her being an incredible player is correct - explosive, powerful and she puts in a lot of work. But I would hope that I would win.""  Battle of the sexes  A crowd of 30,000 watched Billie Jean King take on Bobby Riggs in Houston in 1973  Tennis matches between men and women have occurred before, mostly notably back in 1973 when Billie Jean King took on fellow American Bobby Riggs.  Riggs, the world number one in the 1940s, retired in 1951 and at the age of 55 believed he could beat any of the top female players.  King originally declined to play Riggs and Australian Margaret Court - at the time the top female player in the world - stepped in. Riggs won 6-2 6-1.  But later that year, the top ranked women's player King - 26 years younger than Riggs at 29 - took him on in an exhibition match at the Houston Astrodome and won 6-4 6-3 6-3.  A third 'Battle of the Sexes' match took in 1992 between American former world number one Jimmy Connors, aged 40 at the time, and Czech and American Martina Navratilova, who was 35.  The match took place under special rules to make it more competitive - Connors was allowed only one serve per point, and Navratilova was allowed to hit into half the doubles court. Connors won 7-5 6-2.","The 'Battle of the Sexes' match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs was watched by a crowd of 30,000 at the Houston Astrodome in 1973  'I would hope that I would win against Serena'  Former world number one Dmitry Tursunov believes he could beat Serena Williams, despite the seven-time Grand Slam champion's incredible record on the court  The debate about the gender gap in tennis has been reignited by John McEnroe's claims that Serena Williams would struggle to be in the world's top 700 if she played on the men's circuit  But Tursunov is not convinced, saying he would hope to beat the 35-year-old American  ""It's not black and white, there are lots of factors to take into account. Physically I might not be in the best shape of my life but as an overall package I'm much better than my ranking would suggest. She is pregnant, and I'm not,"" he said  The debate over the gender gap in tennis has been ongoing for years, with some arguing that men's tennis is inherently more physical and competitive than women's tennis  However, others point to the fact that women's tennis has produced some of the greatest players of all time, including Williams and her long-time rival Maria Sharapova  Despite the debate, it is unlikely that Williams will be dropping down to play on the men's circuit anytime soon, with the mother-of-one focused on her return to the WTA tour after the birth of her daughter  ""I would hope that I would win against Serena,"" Tursunov said, but it remains to be seen whether he would be able to back up his claims on the court."
gossipcop-4541624536,1,0,"Two arrests have been made in the murders of four women at Fairmont Terrace Apartments last month, police announced Wednesday afternoon.  Brothers, James Stanford Poore, 32, and Cedric Dwayne Poore, 39, were arrested and booked on four complaints each of first degree murder, Chief Chuck Jordan said.  On Monday, January 7, 2013, twin sisters Rebeika Powell and Kayetie Powell-Melchor, 23; Misty Nunley, 33, and Julie Jackson, 55 were found shot in the head, with their hands tied behind their backs inside a south Tulsa apartment, police say. A 3-year-old boy was also found inside the apartment, unharmed.  Chief Jordan said the murders were not gang-related. According to arrest reports, witnesses told investigators that the brothers left an apartment in the same building at Fairmont Terrace Apartments, near 61st and Peoria, saying they were going to pull a ""lick"" at the victims' apartment.  Witnesses told police the brothers returned about 20 minutes later with a bag full of drugs, cash, and jewelry. According to the report, James Poore told the witnesses that he shot one of the victims because she could identify him and that Cedric shot the other three. The witnesses told investigators the brothers split the money and that Cedric Poore took the jewelry to pawn.    When he was interviewed Wednesday, James Poore confirmed to investigators that he knew one of the victims and that he was in the apartment where the witnesses placed him. Before invoking his right to remain silent, he told investigators he knew one of the victims had used and sold illegal drugs and that Cedric drove a black van to the apartment the day of the murders.    The arrest report shows Cedric Poore denied being in the apartment the day of the murders and refused to speak to investigators any more.  Chief Jordan said the brothers both stayed at Fairmont Terrace Apartments. The property manager there told News On 6 that neither of them are on a lease.  Cedric Poore has been in Tulsa County jail on a traffic violation since January 14, and James Poore was arrested Wednesday morning. Department of Corrections records show both James and Cedric have been previously convicted and incarcerated for robbery with a firearm.  Chief Jordan said more arrests may still be made.  Mayor Dewey Bartlett released a statement Wednesday afternoon, in response to the news of the arrests:    ""The Tulsa Police Department is known for their quick efforts of finding perpetrators and they indeed lived up to their stellar reputation for this case. I have the utmost confidence in Chief Chuck Jordan and the Tulsa Police Department and I knew they would bring in those involved with this hideous quadruple murder in very short order. Although a direct tip from the public cannot be identified as the catalyst that led to the arrests, tips are always important, which is part of great police work from our force.""","The mayor added, ""Our hearts and prayers go out to the family and friends of the victims and especially the little boy who witnessed such evil. We will do everything in our power to make sure justice is served and to make sure this never happens again in our city.""  The victims were identified as twin sisters Rebeika Powell and Kayetie Powell-Melchor, 23; Misty Nunley, 33, and Julie Jackson, 55."

In the family's celebratory Hollywood Reporter cover story, Kendall explained to the magazine that members of the crew can't help sobbing when one of the girls opens up.  Hollywood reporter A post shared by Kendall (@kendalljenner) on Aug 16, 2017 at 8:26am PDT  She said, 'We have such a personal relationship with the crew. When one of us cries on the show usually you'll look around and the camera guy is crying and the producer is crying'  Kim added, 'It really is an intimate relationship. These people see every last thing.'  The crew can go from anything from one iPhone to a 30-strong team, all watching their every move.

Though we as a public have received no evidence of how Kendall reacted to the onslaught of criticism (she has deleted all evidence of it on her social media and has never made a statement), Kim explains that Kendall would never let herself be shown on camera crying.  She told the magazine:  We're not perfect, but you see these things in the media, like Kendall and Pepsi, where I see her at home crying, but in the media she looks another way because she's not addressing it. I'm just like, 'This is wrong. You need to speak up.' She was like, 'I don't ever want to show that footage of me crying.' She was trying to not make excuses or be dramatic, but that was what she was going through at the time.  We suppose the only non-family members who know the truth are those blubbering crew members then.","Kendall, Scott and Khloe's most recent seasons have shown the most emotional depth.  Kim added: 'You can see how much the girls have grown up and how much they've been through and it's not always pretty.  It's not always easy. But you can see how much they care about each other. You can see how much they love each other.  'And that's what the show is all about.  It's not just about Keeping Up With The Kardashians, it's about what they're going through.

gossipcop-211703249,1,1,"His sweet escape. Blake Shelton credits Gwen Stefani for getting him back on his feet following his divorce from Miranda Lambert. The country superstar opened up about his romance with the No Doubt frontwoman in a new interview with Billboard magazine.  As previously reported, Shelton told Stefani that he was splitting from Lambert during a meeting with their Voice coworkers. The “Misery” singer, who was new to the team at the time, got emotional.  “I won’t forget that day. I looked over at Gwen — who I didn’t really know — and she had these huge tears in her eyes. I thought, ‘Wow, she feels super bad for me!’” Shelton recalled. “She didn’t tell me much, because we didn’t know each other at the time, but she said, ‘I’m going through something very similar to what you’re going through. I understand. And I hate it.’”  Stefani was dealing with her own breakup at the time with Gavin Rossdale. (As Us Weekly exclusively revealed, the Bush rocker was cheating on her with their children’s nanny, Mindy Mann.) They announced they were ending their 13-year marriage in August 2015, one month after Shelton and Lambert announced they were divorcing after four years.  The “Came Here to Forget” singer and Stefani leaned on each other for support during the difficult time. The closer they got, the more Shelton saw Stefani in a new light.  “That’s kind of how our friendship and bond started, that day. It went from that, to checking in on each other once a week through email — ‘This s–t happened to me, what happened to you?’ — to maybe three times a week, then every day, to ‘Hey, here’s my phone number if you ever want to text,’” Shelton told Billboard. “Next thing I know, I wake up and she’s all I care about, and I’m ­wondering if she feels the same about me.”  “Gwen saved my life,” he added. “Who else on earth could understand going through a high-profile divorce from another musician? You can’t even imagine the similarities in our divorces.”  The two teamed up professionally too. Shelton included their collaborative track, “Go Ahead and Break My Heart,” on his 12th studio album, If I’m Honest.  “When we recorded the vocals for some of these songs, I was only six months removed from when all the crap went down,” Shelton said of his split from Lambert. “When you have a broken heart — at least, when I do — you got to get it out of your system. You want people to sympathize with you.

In addition to her net worth, she has a highly coveted position in the world of magazine publishing. She has also served as the (albeit not very flattering) inspiration for the popular novel and movie The Devil Wears Prada. Her career began in the world of fashion before moving into journalism, largely at the behest of her parents. In the year 1970, Wintour was hired on as an editorial assistant for the new Harper's & Queen fashion magazine. Even at this early stage of her career, Wintour divulged to coworkers that she had the desire to edit Vogue, a desire that would grow to be fulfilled nearly 20 years later. Wintour introduced sweeping changes to Vogue from her first issue forward. Many of these changes could be seen right on the cover. Wintour favored more naturalistic photography of lesser-known models outside, as opposed to the tight headshots the magazine had previously favored. Additionally, Wintour's first Vogue cover was also the first to feature a model wearing jeans, with the added bonus of wearing a bejeweled T-shirt valued at around $10,000.

It’s been more than two years since Blake Shelton, 40, and Miranda Lambert, 33, ended their marriage, but she’s finally ready to sit down and hash things out, according to a new report. Amidst new rumors that Blake is having trouble in his relationship with Gwen Stefani, 47, an insider tells InTouch that Miranda wants to confront her ex to finally get closure. “It needs to be done,” the source tells the mag. “There’s still a lot of unfinished business between [Miranda] and Blake. She needs to look straight into Blake’s eyes, ask certain questions, and get answers.”  There are no plans set for this meeting to actually take place just yet, but the mag claims that if it does happen, Miranda plans to go in with a “clear head,” although that might not be so easy. “This could get heated,” the insider admits. “As soon as the emotions come up, [Miranda] may lose it.” This doesn’t mean the 33-year-old wants to get back together with her ex, though — actually, it’s just the opposite. She’s very happy with her man, Anderson East, 29, but feels a face-to-face with Blake is what she needs to fully be ready to commit to another relationship, according to the source.  “She feels that [she and Blake] have both grown so much since their divorce that meeting up is essential for them to have healthy relationships in the future,” InTouch’s insider says. “Who knows, maybe this meeting with Blake will have them walk away as friends.

It was like she barely registered he was there,’ says an eyewitness who spotted them out in LA.  In a blow to Kris’ ego, it’s believed that Corey, Justin Bieber’s former road manager, initiated their break-up.  ‘She had been nagging him about a number of things for a while, including the fact that he wasn’t spending as much time with her as she’d like, and he just couldn’t take it anymore,' says Star’s source, who adds that Kris is devastated.  ‘She can’t stand to be alone.

gossipcop-4524134287,1,0,"No need to rush. Jennifer Lopez is not in a hurry to walk down the aisle with Alex Rodriguez, but she does want to spend the rest of her life with someone.  “I do believe in marriage,” the Shades of Blue actress, 48, told Harper’s Bazaar in a story published on Thursday, March 15. “And I would love to grow old with somebody in a committed relationship. But I’m not forcing anything right now.”  As far as her relationship with the 42-year-old former Yankees player, she said: “It’s good, it’s healthy; we communicate well. We understand each other’s lives in a way that most other people couldn’t.”  She added: “We both entered the public eye in our early twenties and overachieved right from the start. And that affects every dynamic in your life, from your family to your work to your relationships. We have a similar makeup.”  The pair celebrated their anniversary in February in Minneapolis, where the singer performed a concert ahead of the Super Bowl. During the show, she debuted her single “Us” written by Poo Bear and produced by Skrillex, and dedicated it to Rodriguez, who was in the audience. “We’ve been together for one year today. I don’t want to get all mushy or anything, but baby, this song’s for you. I love you,” she told the athlete while on stage.  When talking about how she chose the song, Lopez told the magazine that the lyrics fit right into where the couple were in their relationship. She said: “They played me about 20 different songs, and when I heard this one I was like, ‘Oh, this is relevant!’ Alex and I were just getting to know each other. And I was like, ‘Oh, my God, could this be? Could this be us?’”  Lopez was previously married to chef Ojani Noa for nearly a year in 1997, and dancer Cris Judd from 2001 to 2002. She later married singer Marc Anthony in 2004 and they called it quits in 2011. The pair share 10-year-old twins Max and Emme. The former Yankees shortstop shares daughters Ella, 9, and Natasha, 13, with ex-wife Cynthia Scurtis. They split in 2008 after six years of marriage.  A lot has changed in the “Dance Again” songstress’ life since her last relationship, and she said a lot of it has to do with really knowing herself. “When I was younger I spent a lot of time being half happy and half not happy,” she told the publication. “I know who I am and what I want. I also know my strengths and weaknesses. It took me a long time to get to a point where I could say something nice about myself. I’m glad I can do that now.”  Lopez remains optimistic as she continues with her career, raise her two children and make her relationship with Rodriguez work for the long run. “Baseball is just like life,” she said. “All you want to do is hit a home run.”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!","Paraphrased passage:

gossipcop-5658990975,1,1,"Daniel Craig is returning as James Bond once again, even as he reportedly fights to save his marriage to Rachel Weisz at the same time. Craig has already announced his intent to return as 007 in the franchise’s 25th film, and according to the National Enquirer, he’s still struggling to salvage what’s left of his marriage.  The Enquirer’s source claimed at the beginning of 2017, “Rachel and Daniel haven’t been happy for a while, and nearly called it quits last year.” The report claims that the married couple was in two separate filming locations at the beginning of the year, but continued to stay apart even after wrapping their respective films. The Enquirer then claims that they finally reunited in July after not being seen together in ‘554 days’.  According to the sources, the minute the outlet attempted to lock down an exclusive on the couple’s rocky marriage, both Rachel Weisz and Daniel Craig were seen arriving at New York’s Public Theater the next day, prompting the source to add, “The whole thing just seemed like too much of a coincidence. I don’t buy it for a minute.”  When you consider Daniel Craig’s own words, especially in the context of allegedly turning down a $150 million payday to star in two more James Bond films, he had stated, “Being on your own would be sad, sick, and weird. I don’t trust myself. I need that balance.” If these reports are to be believed, then Daniel Craig previously turned down starring in more Bond films to spend time with his family, but now – all of a sudden – he’s back to working on James Bond?  Either the report was never accurate to begin with, or he’s giving up on his marriage to Rachel Weisz. One would hope that the two have worked out whatever was troubling them in the first place, but given their own relationship and marriage histories – and how they’ve both jumped ship on long-term relationships at the drop of a hat – one wouldn’t be faulted for assuming that they are on their way to getting a divorce.  What do you guys think? Are Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz having marriage troubles, and is Daniel’s decision to take on the role of 007 again an indication that he’s giving up on his marriage? Or just a chance to have more career stability and/or cash in on a major paycheck? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.  Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images for Sony Pictures",".
I paraphrased the given passage as follows:
Daniel Craig is reportedly set to reprise his role as James Bond for the 25th film in the franchise, despite allegedly struggling to save his marriage to Rachel Weisz. Sources claim that the couple has been apart for a significant period of time and only recently reconciled. However, some remain skeptical about the report, suggesting that Craig may be prioritizing his career over his relationship. The actor has previously expressed a desire for balance in his life, which has led some to question whether he is truly committed to his marriage. The situation has sparked debate among fans, who are eagerly awaiting more information about Craig's personal life."
gossipcop-4774142356,1,1,"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired.

Childhood pal Ninaki Priddy opened up about Prince Harry's fiancée, claiming her desire to be famous outweighed her commitment to her marriage to film producer Trevor Engelson.  Meghan married her ex back in 2011 on a Jamaican beach. They split two years later after she landed her role in Suits, which filmed in Toronto. Previously it was thought the pair grew apart after Meghan spent months filming in Canada and her beau was based in LA.  Ninaki says otherwise.  (Image: Getty Images North America)  (Image: REX/Shutterstock)  ""The way she handled it, Trevor definitely had the rug pulled out from under him. He was hurt,"" she said, explaining that while Trevor was heartbroken, Meghan was less affected,"" she told Mail Online.  Prior to their split, Ninaki - who was maid of honour at the wedding - said the pair doted on each other and Trevor would have done anything for the actress.  ""Then, after the wedding, it was like a light switched off. There’s Meghan before fame and Meghan after fame. After three seasons of Suits, she called me to say the marriage was over.  The pair first met aged two at Hollywood’s private Little Red School House before they went to the Immaculate Heart girls’ high school in Los Angeles at the age of 11.  Following a close friendship that she describes as 'sisterly', Ninaki says the pair eventually fell out over how Meghan and ex-husband - who the ex Suits star met when she was just 23 - split.  She explains she went to visit Trevor who was heartbroken over their split, while Meghan seemed less affected.

""I think it’s a very fanciful dream to believe that you just walk into a Prince Charming.  ""I know the Royal Family was something she found fascinating. She had one of Princess Diana’s books [Diana: Her True Story] on her bookshelf, and even when she was with Trevor she told me she wanted to go and stay in London for at least a month.""

gossipcop-2685135840,1,0,"When the Spice Girls made their video for the hit song Say You’ll Be There in 1996 at the height of their fame, they knew that it was an important moment in their pop careers.  But for Victoria Adams, then known as Posh Spice, it turned out to be a key moment in her personal life too.  The video would soon catch the eye of Premier League soccer player David Beckham, who immediately picked out the brunette Spice Girl in her black PVC catsuit and matching gloves.  He declared: “That’s the girl for me and I'm going to get her! She's my idea of perfection. I knew that if she wanted me, we would be together forever.”  They later met at a Manchester United soccer players’ lounge, where it was love at first sight—although Victoria later admitted she was a little tipsy at the time.  The couple married in 1999 and had four children; sons Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz, and Harper. The pair have also forged a successful brand over their almost 20-year marriage, with Victoria starting a successful fashion label after attempting a less-than-stellar solo music career.  However, it hasn’t all been so rosy. The couple have endured a number of accusations of infidelity on David’s behalf, including from his former personal assistant Rebecca Loos in 2004.  The couple’s former nanny, Abbie Gibson, came forward in 2005 to stay their marriage was a sham, a claim hotly disputed by the Beckhams.  David retired from professional soccer in 2013, playing his final game in boots with the names of his wife and children stitched on to them.  He has consistently ranked among the highest earners in the sport. His net worth as of March 2017 is $450 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth—a number which Victoria matches through her own earnings.  As their marriage nears the two decade mark, we look back at the couple’s best moments. From spray-tanned party animals to chic and professional parents, these pictures show just how far they’ve come.","As Victoria Beckham once said, “Marriage is a great adventure, but it’s not all smooth sailing. There are going to be ups and downs, but if you love each other enough, you’ll find a way to make it work.”  In an exclusive interview with OK! magazine in 2015, Victoria said: “David and I have been married for 16 years, and I couldn’t imagine being with anyone else. We’ve had our ups and downs, like any couple, but we’ve always found a way to come out stronger on the other side.”  But for David Beckham, it was more than just a marriage of convenience.  He once said in an interview with The Guardian: “I knew when I met Victoria that she was the one for me. I’m not sure what it is about her, but I know I want to spend the rest of my life with her.”  As the couple celebrate their 20th wedding anniversary, OK! magazine looks back on their journey from pop stars to soccer stars, and everything in between.

Twigs since 2014, and recently told Howard Stern they were “kind of” engaged. But when asked by GQ if he was getting married, the actor — who revealed he calls his girlfriend Twigs — responded with a noncommittal “eh.” Pattinson told the magazine that he went to therapy a few years ago – and his therapist commented that he was good at “talking without saying anything.” He said he uses that skill in all his interviews. “I want to be misunderstood,” he told the magazine after declining to talk about anything personal. “People are always changing, and the more you put something down in print, people form opinions and they’re constantly creating who they think you are. If you do something that contradicts that, or if you do something which goes out of that box, then you can look like a liar or something like that.” Pattinson also revealed the great lengths he’d go to during the height of the Twilight whirlwind to a little privacy. He recalled how he would have different cars parked around Los Angeles with a full change of clothes. If he noticed he was being followed by paparazzi, he would pop into the garages, change, and leave in a different car. He would also try to confuse photographers by having all of his friends order different rides out of restaurants when they were together and sending the cars to different places after trading outfits with one of his friends. Pattinson also recalled riding in trunks several times to hide from the photographers – and once drove around all night when one was tailing him to find out where his new house is. “There are ways to disappear, like, fairly easily,” he said. “It just involves effort, and most people can’t be bothered to put the effort in.” Good Time hits theaters August 11.

Caitlyn touched down in London town last week to promote her to promote her juicy new autobiography The Secrets Of My Life (she even popped by the This Morning studios) and many are speculating whether she had a secret meeting with Celebrity Big Brother bosses.  Sources have told the Daily Star: ""The bookers are really keen to have Caitlyn in the house.  ""They know she’d be TV gold so they’re prepared to break the bank for her. The world has been fascinated by Caitlyn’s story and getting her would push ratings through the roof.""  Well, they're not wrong there.  Caitlyn is no stranger to reality telly – she's starred in Keeping Up With The Kardashians since forevs, and even had her own show I Am Cait – and after proof that the Kardashian/Jenner family feud is still rife, this could be the perfect opportunity for her to set the record straight.  She even recently revealed that she hasn't spoken to Kim Kardashian in a 'very long time'.  ""I love Kimberly, I think she's a wonderful person,"" Caitlyn said on Australia's Today show.  ""But, well, to be honest with you, I really haven't talked to her in a long time. I've kind of let everything calm down. So I kind of stay, you know, I keep my distance. I'm out there trying to make a difference in the world. There's a lot of drama in the Kardashian family.""  And staying loyal to her momager, Kim didn't hold back during a recent interview with Ellen DeGeneres and even implied that Caitlyn was lying about the things she had said about Kris in her memoir.  ""My heart breaks for my mom, you know, because I feel like she’s been through so much and Caitlyn is promoting this book and she’s saying all these things.  ""I don’t think it’s necessary and I just feel like it’s unfair, things aren’t truthful.""

The former Olympic athlete and reality TV star is said to be in talks with producers about joining the show, which is set to air later this year.  Caitlyn, 67, has previously starred in Keeping Up With The Kardashians and had her own reality show I Am Cait, and her appearance on Celebrity Big Brother would no doubt generate a lot of interest and ratings for the show.

However, a source close to Caitlyn has told The Sun: ""Caitlyn has not been approached by Big Brother and has no plans to go on the show.  She is focused on her own projects and is not interested in doing reality TV at the moment.""  It's worth noting that Caitlyn has not yet confirmed or denied the reports, so it's unclear at this stage whether she will actually appear on the show.  However, if she does decide to enter the house, it's likely to be a highly anticipated and dramatic moment for fans of the show."
gossipcop-7658353025,1,0,"“A Star Is Born” is that thing we always yearn for but so rarely get to see: a transcendent Hollywood movie. It’s the fourth remake of a story that dates back to 1932, but this one has a look and vibe all its own — rapturous and swooning, but also delicate and intimate and luminous. It’s set in the present day, but in spirit it’s a sophisticated retro ’70s drama built around the uncanny flow of feeling that develops between the movie’s two stars: Bradley Cooper, who plays Jackson Maine, a hard-drinking, bad-ol’-boy redneck rock ‘n’ roller who is still hanging on as a popular attraction but has lost the lust for what he’s doing, and Lady Gaga, in her fetching and accomplished movie-star debut, as Ally, an ingenuous, fresh-faced singer-songwriter who becomes his lover and stage partner before rocketing on her own into the new pop stratosphere. She takes off as he slowly crashes — that’s the soapy tragic “Star Is Born” concept. But what the movie does is to take this fabled melodramatic romantic seesaw and turn it into something indelibly heartfelt and revealing. Cooper directed the movie himself, working from a script he co-wrote with Eric Roth and Will Fetters, and to say that he does a good job would be to understate his accomplishment. As a filmmaker, Bradley Cooper gets right onto the high wire, staging scenes that take their time and play out with a shaggy intimacy that’s shorn of the usual “beats.” The new “Star Is Born” is a total emotional knockout, but it’s also a movie that gets you to believe, at every step, in the complicated rapture of the story it’s telling. More Reviews Venice Film review: 'Isis, Tomorrow. The Lost Souls of Mosul' Telluride Film Review: 'They'll Love Me When I'm Dead' The 1976 version, starring Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson, had some terrific cornball love songs, but they didn’t belong anywhere near the stadium-rock stage, and neither did Streisand, which is part of why the movie came off as borderline ludicrous. It seemed stranded, with a kind of campy sincere ineptitude, between three worlds: Old Hollywood, New Hollywood, and Barbra Streisand rock-princess fantasy. But from the electrifying opening moments of the new version, in which Jackson, boozy and raw, with his sunburned squint and hard-bitten shit-kicker sexiness, takes the stage of a gigantic stadium and launches into a grinding slow rocker that sounds like “Victim of Love”-era Eagles as done by the Allman Brothers, the movie is thrillingly authentic. That’s no minor accomplishment. Hollywood almost never succeeds in nailing the rock world, but “A Star Is Born,” though a love story through and through, is the most lived-in rock ‘n’ roll movie since “Almost Famous.” And that absolute looks right, sounds right, feels right verisimilitude sets the stage for everything that follows. Jackson, who looks to be in his mid-40s, has been around long enough that he now occupies a grey zone between legend and nostalgia. He can still fill an arena full of screaming fans, and his old hits have become classic-rock chestnuts, but his sound and persona have long slipped out of the zeitgeist. His whole outlaw look — the beard and rancher’s hat, the Kristofferson-meets-Skynyrd soused macho twinkle — mark him as a charismatic relic, and the grand irony is this: What that look, and sound, are all about is an era when rock ‘n’ roll strutted its “authenticity,” but now that he’s out of date, Jackson’s authenticity looks more than ever like a showbiz conceit, frozen in amber. It’s a part he’s playing, an image he’s working — and secretly struggling — to keep alive. He’s got a signature ballad that goes “Maybe it’s time to let the old ways die,” and when he wrote it (long ago), he probably didn’t know that he was talking about himself. In the first of many telling jump cuts, the film leaps from his on-stage glory to Jackson slinking into the back of his car, weary and alone, grabbing the bottle of gin he’s got stashed there. He takes a guzzle, and Coop",", he’s gone, and the movie starts to spin its web of emotion around her. Gaga, in her first major movie role, is nothing short of extraordinary. In an early scene, she sings a song she’s written, “Shallow,” that’s all about how she’s lost herself in her quest for stardom, and though the song is a showstopper, it’s also a heartbreaker. The way she sings it, with a quiet desperation, as if she’s trying to find her own voice again, is devastating. She doesn’t have to do much else to make you believe that Ally could become the biggest star in the world. (She can sing, dance, act, and, as the movie shows us, look good in a jumpsuit.) The movie doesn’t turn her into a victim, though. She’s got an easy confidence and a sharp wit, and she’s not afraid to call Jackson on his bullshit. They’re an unlikely pair, but their romance is never less than convincing. They’re both lost souls, and they find each other. It’s a love story that’s so natural, it feels like a relic from another time, when movies still believed in the power of love."

Years later, Brad regrets leaving the Friends star for his now-ex Angelina Jolie, a source told In Touch exclusively.  Following his 2016 separation from Angie, Brad sobered up and sought therapy. And now, he’s “in touch with emotions and his true self like never before,” the source says.  Brad Pitt finally opens up about his bitter divorce with Angelina Jolie  And it seems like this self-awareness comes with some great realisations. “He has come to realise that leaving Jen for Angelina was one of the biggest mistakes of his life,” the source adds. “And while he’s not in love with Jen, he realises how much he does love her. Brad keeps telling friends that he’s seeing everything more clearly.”  However, these realisations are obviously far too late. Jennifer has been married to Wanderlust co-star Justin Theroux for two years now.  And while Brad would “never dream of” ruining his ex’s new marriage, he “would take a second chance at love with Jen in a heartbeat.”  If they can’t be romantic partners, though, the War Machine star wants Jen to be his partner in other pursuits, In Touch further reported.

gossipcop-4241884018,1,1,"In the past, Kanye’s capriciousness has been repeatedly forgiven and, at times, belatedly rewarded with accolades. It is hard to imagine a My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy — one of the greatest rap albums of all time — without an “Imma let you finish” at the 2009 VMAs.  His new album, ye, doesn’t merit any similar mercy.  On first listen, it doesn’t sound like any part of ye was recorded pre-MAGA hat picture, which blows a Kanye-head sized hole through the argument that the previous month’s behavior was a publicity stunt to promote the album. If anything, the album seems like an meek afterthought to the Twitter tirade and dive into right-wing politics. Most of it deals with the repercussions of the storm which came before it, and for the first time in his career, the artist’s personality is overwhelming the art.  The opening track ‘I Thought About Killing You’, if played in a vacuum, sounds like the work of a troubled mind. If a poem like this came from a loved one, it would surely merit discussion about a trip to the therapist. Kanye goes on to deliver cringe-worthy rhymes on issues ranging from Russell Simmons rape allegations to his petrification on realizing that his daughter might one day look like his wife. He teases a few tidbits of The Old Kanye, chopping up beats from Slick Rick and The Edwin Hawkins Singers samples on ‘No Mistakes’, to keep his fans just interested enough. It’s telling that the one standout track, ‘Ghost Town’ is the track on which Kanye lurks in the background, devoting more time on production than on spoken word, and letting John Legend and Kid Cudi take over.  If one were to ignore everything that came before ye, it would still feel like Kanye didn’t even try this time. The usual meticulousness and perfectionism has apparently been supplanted by a Kanye shrug. The music is haphazard and hollow, mirroring the guy making it. Maybe he’s become blasé and doesn’t want to spend time on music anymore. He did say he wanted to run for President in 2020 (or 2024?) anyway.","There’s just no denying that ye is the most shrug-worthy Kanye West album yet. Paraphrased, the passage can be rewritten as: In the past, Kanye West has been known to be capricious and has often been forgiven for his erratic behavior. However, his latest album 'ye' does not warrant the same level of forgiveness. The album does not seem to be a deliberate work of art, but rather a collection of half-hearted attempts at music. The opening track 'I Thought About Killing You' is particularly disturbing and raises concerns about Kanye's mental health. The album's lack of coherence and poor production values are reflective of Kanye's current state of mind, which appears to be apathetic and disinterested. The only standout track on the album is 'Ghost Town', which features a minimalist approach to production, allowing John Legend and Kid Cudi to shine. Overall, 'ye' is a disappointing and uninspired effort from Kanye West."

The Gainesville, Fla., native suffered a heart attack Sunday at his home in Malibu, Calif. He was transferred to UCLA Medical Center-Santa Monica, where he was on life support until he died Monday evening at age 66.  Although Petty’s actual time of death was 8:40 p.m. PT on Monday, several media outlets reported that Petty had died earlier in the day, leading to a premature wave of statements and tributes. At his time of death, Petty was “surrounded by family, his bandmates, and friends,” according to Tony Dimitriades, the longtime manager of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.  “It’s shocking, crushing news,” Bob Dylan said in a statement. “I thought the world of Tom.

gossipcop-5592793027,1,0,"Gary Null/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images Jennifer Aniston as Rachel Green and Lisa Kudrow as Phoebe Buffay during the filming of the “Friends” episode “The One with Ross's Wedding: Part 1” in 1998.  Lisa Kudrow has offered up even more proof that the cast of “Friends” took the name of the beloved sitcom to heart.  On Monday, the actress told People that her co-stars altered a pre-show ritual when she was pregnant during Seasons 4 and 5 to include her unborn child — her now 20-year-old son, Julian Murray Stern.  “The six of us would do a huddle backstage and just say, ‘All right, have a good show, love you love you love you love you,’” Kudrow, 55, told the outlet. “And when I was pregnant, then they would say, ‘Have a great show, love you love you — love you, little Julian!’ ’Cause we knew it was a boy and that was his name.”  She added: “So sweet, they included my little fetus in the huddle.”  The stars of “Friends” embraced one another’s children at other times, too. In 2005, Jennifer Aniston was named godmother of Courteney Cox’s daughter, Coco Arquette.","“They’re just the best, they’re just the best,” Kudrow said of her co-stars, who she noted are “like family.”  Kudrow herself was also named godmother of Aniston’s daughter, Vera Aniston, in 2015.  In addition to their on-screen chemistry, the cast of “Friends” seemed to have a genuine affection for one another off-screen as well.  Kudrow said that the cast would often have dinner together and that “we’d all sleep at each other’s houses.”  In a 2014 interview with the U.K. edition of Esquire, Aniston said that she and her co-stars would often go on vacation together.  And in a 2018 interview with Ellen DeGeneres, Cox said that the cast would get together for holidays and that “we’re like a big, happy family.”  In short, the cast of “Friends” was more than just a group of actors who worked together on a hit TV show. They were a close-knit group that supported one another both on and off the screen."

The obvious answer is that Justin and Hailey are in love and want to spend forever together, but there's also a rumor lurking in some corners of the internet (read: Twitter) claiming that Hailey's pregnant. Which, to be clear, is definitely not anyone's business, and is also pretty sexist!

You just seem too like, you just seem too normal to be doing this job... I just don’t understand why you gotta try to get a rise, you know what I’m saying?""

gossipcop-1716370499,1,0,"Dakota Johnson; most of us know her as the actress from Fifty Shades of Grey. While we may have seen Johnson in some pretty intimate positions on-screen, there’s definitely a lot we don’t know about the Fifty Shades star. Like, for instance, the superfluity of familiar names in her family tree. Seeing that her popular movie, Fifty Shades Darker came out on the day of love—Valentine's Day—it's only fitting to dedicate a piece to the actress who brought us the sexy and quaint, Anastasia Steele. Johnson, after all, has become somewhat something of a Valentine’s Day staple, herself. Here are 15 facts about Dakota Johnson or, as some might call her, ""that girl from Fifty Shades of Grey."" We guarantee that she will no longer by ""that girl"" by the end of the list! 15 Her Family Tree Is Full Of Famous Faces You know how we said there are a few familiar names in her family tree? Well, we weren’t lying. Her parents are fellow actors, Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson. Unfortunately, her parents divorced in 1994 so Dakota had to split her time between the two. ""It was the only way that I could be with them,"" she said in an interview for Cosmopolitan. ""And since they were divorced, I would spend two weeks with one and two weeks with the other, traveling with a tutor."" But wait, it gets better. Her maternal grandmother (can you guess..) is Hitchcock actress Tippi Hedren. Yes, that’s right, so clearly creative talent lies in that family. We’ve never heard of a family tree with so many famous names! Thanksgiving is probably a whirlwind. Now, Dakota Johnson is another famous name in that tree. 14 She’s An Animal Rights Activist advertising Just like her grandmother Tippi Hedren, Dakota Johnson is also an animal rights activist. Like grandmother, like granddaughter shall we say? As animal lovers ourselves, we’re pleased to hear that she’s following in her grandmother’s footsteps—both in acting and in animal rights. In 2014, Johnson saved 12 horses from being slaughtered by paying for them. What a sweet thing to do! We bet her grandmother was really proud. It’s always so great to hear about celebrities doing positive things - so naturally, we’re happy to hear of Dakota’s compassionate side. We admit we have a soft spot for animal lovers, but who doesn't? We always love hearing about people doing good deeds for animals and it’s always nice to hear celebrities using their celebrity title for the better. 13 She Grew Up Shooting Guns And Riding Horses In Colorado She may play the innocent and naive Anastasia Steele in the Fifty Shades movies, but growing up Johnson was anything but naive. She grew up in Colorado at her dad’s house, where she learned to build a fire, ride a horse, ride motorbikes, and even shoot a gun. And this was all before she was just 10 years old! Sounds like a badass kid to us! But when she wasn’t at her father’s house, she was at her mom’s house in L.A. which she also loved. It's hard to imagine a 10 year old these days shooting guns, riding motorbikes, or building fires without being grounded. But it sounds like she had a pretty inspiring and freeing childhood which makes us fall for the actress all the more. 12 She Never Dates advertising By the header, we mean she never has casual relationships. She only has long-term relationships. Good for her, is all we can say! You hear of so many celebrities who are constantly dating other celebrities. You can barely keep up with who they’re dating these days. It seems to be one guy or girl after another. So it’s great to hear of Dakota’s conservative views on relationships. Apparently she’s only ever been in long-term, serious relationships; she doesn’t just date. That probably explains why she’s been in a relationship with model Matthew Hitt since 2014. Yes, it’s been a kind of an on-and-off relationship but they’ve been in it for the long haul so far. So, to sum up, we like her whole dating attitude. The commitment is great and saves you a lot of time. 11 She HATED School It seems l","us, even Dakota Johnson. So don’t worry, we’re all in the same boat. 9 She’s Actually Related To A President advertising Whoa, did you hear this one? Dakota Johnson is actually related to a former U.S. President! It turns out that she’s the great-granddaughter of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Yes, we were surprised too. Who knew that Dakota Johnson was actually the descendant of a U.S. President? Apparently, her great-grandmother was Eleanor Roosevelt, who was the wife of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. That’s pretty cool. This is one of those tidbits of information that you just wouldn’t expect about someone like Dakota Johnson, who doesn’t exactly come off as a history buff. But hey, it’s always interesting to learn about the family connections of celebrities. 8 She’s A Great Cook advertising Okay, so this might not be that surprising considering she’s got a pretty good role model in her grandmother Tippi Hedren. But still, Dakota Johnson is actually a great cook. She claims that she and her mom would cook together a lot when she was younger and now that she’s older, she still loves to cook. We can imagine that cooking with her grandmother Tippi Hedren must have been quite the experience! Who knows, maybe she’ll open up her own restaurant one day? It’s definitely not the kind of thing you expect to hear about someone like Dakota Johnson, but we’re glad to hear that she’s got a talent for cooking. 7 She Has A Tattoo Of A Penis On Her Body advertising Well, here’s something you don’t expect to hear about Dakota Johnson! Apparently, she has a tattoo of a penis on her body. Yes, you heard that right. According to Johnson herself, she got the tattoo on a whim during a night out with friends. Now, we’re not sure if this is something that will shock you or not, but there you have it. Dakota Johnson has a tattoo of a penis on her body. 6 She’s Actually Related To A President Again advertising Hold up, didn’t we just say she was related to a President? Apparently, Johnson is actually related to two former U.S. Presidents! Not only is she the great-granddaughter of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, but she’s also the niece of former President Lyndon B. Johnson. Yes, we were surprised too. Who knew that Dakota Johnson was actually related to not one but two U.S. Presidents? Pretty cool, right? 5 She’s A Vegan advertising More and more celebrities are going vegan these days, but Dakota Johnson is one of the first ones to make the switch. She claims that she went vegan after doing some research and realizing just how terrible animal agriculture is for the environment and the animals themselves. We commend her for making the change. While it can be tough to give up certain foods, it’s great to see celebrities using their platform to promote positive change. Veganism is definitely on the rise, and more and more people are learning about the benefits of a plant-based diet. 4 She’s A Nature Lover advertising Dakota Johnson is definitely not your typical Hollywood celebrity. While many celebrities are content to just sit around and collect their paychecks, Johnson actually gets out there and does things. Like hiking! Yes, you heard that right. Johnson loves hiking and spending time in nature. In fact, she claims that she feels most like herself when she’s out in nature. We can definitely relate to that. There’s something about being out in nature that just makes you feel alive and grounded, doesn’t it? 3 She’s A Creativity Coach advertising Dakota Johnson is not just an actress; she’s also a creativity coach. Yep, you heard that right. Johnson has actually been a creativity coach for some time now, and she loves helping people tap into their own creativity. She claims that creativity is something that everyone has, but it’s often suppressed by society’s expectations. We can definitely relate to that. It’s always great to hear of celebrities using their platform to help others, and Johnson’s creativity coaching is definitely something we can get behind. 2 She’s A Self-Described ""Rebel"" advertising Dakota Johnson is definitely not your typical Hollywood celebrity. While many celebrities are content to just sit around and collect their paychecks, Johnson actually likes to do things her own way. She calls herself a ""rebel"" and claims that she’s always been a bit of a troublemaker. We can definitely relate to that. It’s always great to hear of celebrities who are willing to break the mold and do things their own way. 1 She’s Got A Tattoo Of Her Grandmother’s Name On Her Body advertising And finally, here’s something you don’t expect to hear about Dakota Johnson: she’s got a tattoo of her grandmother’s name on her body! Yes, you heard that right. Johnson has a tattoo of her grandmother Tippi Hedren’s name on her arm. This is definitely not something you expect to hear about someone like Dakota Johnson, but hey, it’s great to see her showing some love to her grandmother in such a permanent way."

gossipcop-9811720113,1,1,"I, at least, struggle to understand her career. Her performance as a junkie in “The Town” features the “Bride Wars” of Boston accents. Her performance in “The Age of Adaline” — as a woman “cursed” to stay 30 forever — was like watching a mermaid ride a bike. She tries. But her acting hasn’t yet caught up to her algorithm-generated beauty. Alas, there may be no algorithmic solution for that.  So I was less than psyched at the prospect of seeing her shiver on a buoy, stitch her own wounds, talk to animals or play a Nancy. And, as refreshing as it is watching her stand on a surfboard, it’s refreshment that provides some perspective. While some actors make sense on movie screens, there are others who might make better sense on a can of something — beer, beans, air. I can hear you, Hudson skeptics. And all I can say is that the heart wants what the heart wants. I’d actually buy whatever Ms. Hudson was on the can of.  There might be no appreciable industrial difference between what a Kate Hudson can do versus your Blake Livelys. I don’t think they’re interchangeable, but sometimes the movies beg to differ, and the market corrects itself. Don’t fall in love with Mark Harmon, because here comes Kevin Costner. And sell your Brad Rowe stock, because he’s just going to be replaced by Brad Pitt. (In the late 1990s, that pretty much happened.) But there are continuums, too. Channing Tatum, for instance, is a more elastic, hip-hop-era Brendan Fraser upgrade.  Lots of parts that have gone to Ms. Lively feel as if Ms. Hudson could have played them. But something happened, and suddenly it was someone else’s turn to be “it.” (It’s always someone else’s turn.) And part of what annoys me about the lack of Kate Hudson in my life and the surfeit of Ms. Lively is the same thing that makes me angry when a perfectly good piece of software gets a superfluous update, or a zealous waiter takes my plate at a restaurant: I wasn’t done with that.","It’s not just a matter of being more or less talented than Ms. Lively. It’s not just that I don’t want to see her in every movie. It’s that I miss the version of Ms. Hudson that I thought I knew. It’s as if the part of her that I knew has gone away, and now there’s just a shell of it left. And when I look at her on a screen, I feel as if I’m encountering a stranger.  Of course, I’m not the only one. There are plenty of people who will go see anything that Ms. Lively is in, no matter how good or bad it is. But as I watched her in “Ocean’s 8,” I couldn’t help but feel that there’s a gaping hole in the world that could have been filled by Ms. Hudson."

gossipcop-6722352082,1,1,"Carlotta is a fictional character from Gaston Leroux's 1909 novel The Phantom of the Opera.  In the novel, she is a minor character hailing from Spain. The first time that she is mentioned in the novel is during the chapter ""The New Marguerite"", where it is revealed that she could not perform at the ceremony for the former managers. Later in the novel, she is threatened by Erik that if she performs at the Opera House ""a great misfortune will strike"". She shrugs the warning off and performs anyway. When she does, however, croaking noises come out of her mouth and the chandelier comes crashing down. Ashamed, she hides from the public view for a few weeks, before making a return to the opera house.  Carlotta is portrayed by Virginia Pearson in the original 1925 silent film with Lon Chaney. In 1929, new sound scenes were filmed and Mary Fabian was recast as Carlotta, due to the fact that she could sing. Virginia Pearson still appeared in new scenes, now playing Carlotta's mother. These changes are also the same in the 1929 silent, foreign cut of the film (which is most commonly viewed).  In the 1943 film version, she is Mme. Biancarolli who has been drugged by the Phantom and murdered along with her maid when she tries to force him to take off his prop mask.  In Andrew Lloyd Webber's production, Carlotta (last name Giudicelli) is from Italy and is one of the major singing parts. The opera company's prima donna, she despises Christine Daaé and sees the younger woman as a threat to her job and Phantom´s courtesan, when Christine achieves prominence due to the Phantom's dirty tricks. Carlotta and tenor Ubaldo Piangi are lovers; she often turns to him for consolation when things go wrong, and she breaks down crying when his murdered body is discovered onstage. The film reveals that she likes poodles.  In the Lloyd Webber-Joel Schumacher 2004 film version, she was played by Minnie Driver.[1] Due to Driver's lack of experience in opera, her singing voice was dubbed by opera singer Margaret Preece, although she lent her actual voice to the song ""Learn to Be Lonely"" during the end credits.  In Nicholas Meyer's novel The Canary Trainer, the characters of Carlotta and La Sorelli are combined into one, despite being mentioned as separate characters in the original novel. In Kim Newman's short story ""Angels of Music"" from the Tales of the Shadowmen anthology series, Carlotta is implied to be the ancestor of Bianca Castafiore from The Adventures of Tintin comic series.","Here's a paraphrased version of the passage:

gossipcop-178000221,1,0,"Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge wasn’t always a royal, but even before her marriage to Prince William, Kate Middleton had an impressive net worth.  Middleton had a comfortable upbringing before she became the first commoner to join the royal family after she married William in 2011. But Middleton’s net worth ballooned once she became a duchess.  Here’s everything we know about Middleton’s net worth:  What is Kate Middleton’s net worth?  The 36 year-old mother of three — who gave birth to a second baby boy in April — is worth at least £5 million, or $7 million, according to global wealth-tracking firm Wealth-X, though some estimates put her net worth as high as £7.3 million, or $10 million. Middleton’s wealth is mostly in cash because she doesn’t have a personal portfolio of property or artwork.  That being said, Middleton’s net worth is a lot less than her prince — Wealth-X estimates Prince William’s net worth is at least $30 million, though some reports put his fortune closer to $40 million. According to Wealth-X, $19 million of Prince William’s wealth is in cash. The wealth tracking firm also noted that William has an expensive helicopter fit for a royal — an Augusta A109S Grand helicopter which is valued at $11 million.  Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, Prince George of Cambridge and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge arrive for a children's party for Military families during the Royal Tour of Canada on September 29, 2016 in Victoria, Canada. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  What do we know about Kate Middleton’s money?  Most of Middleton’s net worth stems from Party Pieces, an online party supplies business started by her parents. The company is estimated to be worth around £30 million, or $50 million, thanks in no small part to the exposure it gets from being associated with the royals, according to royal expert Marlene Koenig.  Prior to her life as a full-time duchess, Middleton worked for the family business and was a part-time accessories buyer for a retailer called Jigsaw.  Growing up, Kate and her two siblings, Pippa and James Middleton, attended expensive privates schools from a young age, with years of tuition for just one child estimated to be at least £250,000, or $350,000. Kate met Prince William while in college in Scotland at the prestigious University of St. Andrew’s. She graduated in 2005 with a degree in Art History.  How did Kate Middleton’s net worth change after marrying Prince William?  Joining the royal family meant that Middleton was marrying into an incredible $88 billion fortune amassed over generations.  Before Will and Kate became the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and moved into a 20-room apartment in Kensington Palace, Kate lived in an apartment purchased by her parents in the Chelsea neighborhood of London believed to be worth £1 million, or $1.4 million.  Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge smile following their marriage at Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011 in London, England. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  But once Kate officially became a royal she didn’t need to spend much of her own money anymore. Most of her living costs are covered by the private estate Prince Charles manages, the Duchy of Cornwall. The revenue from the Duchy of Cornwall pays for the most of Prince Charles and his family’s royal expenses: things like official travel, wardrobe, housing and staff costs. When Meghan Markle marries Prince Harry on May 19, she too, will get to keep most of her own money — her net worth is believed to be about $5 million — as the Duchy of Cornwall will also absorb the majority of her living costs associated with royal responsibilities.  What is the ‘Kate effect’?  As the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate sets fashion trends all over the world. While she herself does not retain any income from the flurry of economic activity set off by the designer clothes she wears for public appearances, she has triggered what is known as “the Kate Effect,” ","boosting the sales of certain items after she has been seen in them.  The effect has been so profound that retailers often release information about which items the duchess has worn in order to cash in on the increased interest.  In short, the Kate Effect is a way to measure how much money the royal’s clothing choices influence consumer spending.  As one of the most high-profile members of the royal family, the Kate Effect is especially significant for British designers, and has helped to cement the country’s reputation as a world leader in fashion.  How does Kate Middleton’s net worth compare to Prince William’s?  Prince William is worth at least $30 million, according to estimates from Wealth-X, a global wealth-tracking firm.  His net worth is mostly in cash, with $19 million of his wealth in cash, according to Wealth-X.  His inheritance includes an Augusta A109S Grand helicopter valued at $11 million, as well as other assets.  In contrast, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, is worth at least £5 million, or $7 million, according to Wealth-X, although some estimates put her net worth as high as £7.3 million, or $10 million.  Most of Middleton’s net worth stems from Party Pieces, an online party supplies business started by her parents.  The company is estimated to be worth around £30 million, or $50 million, thanks in no small part to the exposure it gets from being associated with the royals."
gossipcop-3178847561,1,0,"Caitlyn Jenner told Diane Sawyer that she had undergone ""the final surgery"" in her gender reassignment procedures on Friday night's ""20/20"" special.  The former Olympian previously known as Bruce confirmed in her book ""The Secrets of My Life,"" coming out on Tuesday, that the 2017 ""surgery was a success.""  And Jenner said on the ABC interview, she had ""no regrets, none whatsoever.""  Beyond that, Jenner didn't want to talk about the details, telling Sawyer, ""I’m not going to dwell on that subject. It's not an appropriate question to ask a trans person.""  But nothing else was off-limits, as Sawyer caught up with Jenner nearly two years after the TV journalist had done their last emotional interview. Then, the ex-athlete stunned the world by revealing how he had lived a lie. Inside, ex-decathlon champ Jenner had always identified as a woman.  Since then, Jenner said she has been ""happy, peaceful…all of that confusion has left me….I did the right thing"" -- and doesn't miss ""Bruce"" a bit.  Sporting red nails and stylishly feminine clothing, Jenner recalled how—when he was still known as Bruce--he had put an instruction in his will: ""When I'm buried, I want to be dressed as her 'cause that's the way I'm going to heaven.""  As many know from her former reality show, ""I Am Cait,"" Jenner is a Republican and she confided to Sawyer, ""Yes, I did vote for Trump.""  Jenner was initially impressed with Trump for reaching out to transgender people at the Republican National Convention and noted, ""He wanted me to come play golf with him.""  But Jenner got upset when President Trump's administration revoked the federal guidelines that allowed public school students to use bathrooms corresponding to their gender identity--believing it's an issue best left to state and local authorities to decide.  ""It was extremely disappointing…you mess with my community, you don't give us equality and a fair shot, I'm coming after you,"" Jenner sighed about President Trump's decision.  Although Jenner has had her jawline, forehead, and breasts worked on, she insists she's always been a woman because what's important is ""what's between your ears.""  Jenner said she's fine with her ex-wife, Kris Jenner, and stays in touch with all her kids while they pursue their own lives.  ""Nobody calls that much. I reach out to them,"" commented the former ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians"" star.  Jenner told Sawyer that she has ""never been on a date"" in the two years since she came out as transgender, and doesn't really see dating in her future.  Instead, Jenner is most focused on helping the transgender community through charities and building awareness about discrimination and other issues.  ""I want to fight this fight,"" she vowed.

The singer is looking out for her girl, Khloe Kardashian, and wants her to know she’s risking ‘serious heartbreak’ trusting Tristan Thompson with his ex. Read on for all the EXCLUSIVE details.  Iggy Azalea, 26, knows a lot about heartbreak when it comes to dealing with men. Especially, those who are still connected to their exes. That said, The New Classic artist is trying to get word to Khloe Kardashian, 32, that Tristan Thompson, 25, may break her heart if she’s not careful.  “Iggy’s not trying to be salty or hate on Tristan but she’s hit up French [Montana], and told her he needs to put Khloe up on game and warn her that she’s putting herself at risk for serious heartbreak with him,” a source close to Iggy told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “Iggy explained to French that these basketball players are no joke and don’t care whose heart they break in their quest to bang every girl that breathes.”  “Iggy still feels some type of way after Nick [Young] cheated on her and then on top of that got his baby mama pregnant – again,” the source continued. “She’s sticking to the girl code and would hate for Khloe to experience the same type of pain she did. She’s hoping French gets to her before it’s too late.”  As HollywoodLife.com previously reported, it’s really hard for KoKo to ignore the rumors that TT and his baby mama, Jordy Craig, are still hooking up. In fact, we’re told Khloe’s hired some private eyes to keep tabs on her dude. “She loves Tristan wholeheartedly and he’s been nothing but a stand-up, loving man,” another source told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “But she can’t help but worry sometimes. Khloe spends as much time in Cleveland as possible and has spies in every city his team plays in.”  HollywoodLifers, do you think Khloe will listen to Iggy?",Or will she keep on loving Tristan despite his past infidelity?
gossipcop-5251247668,1,1,"Despite rumors of a split, Rihanna is still very much together with boyfriend of one year Hassan Jameel. We’ve got the pics of their steamy Mexican getaway  Rihanna has kept her one year romance with Saudi billionaire Hassan Jameel super private. So when rumors surfaced in June that they had broken up fans were waiting to see proof they were still a couple. They got it on July 9 when pics surfaced of the 30-year-old singer and the businessman on a sexy Mexican getaway. The two appeared to be locked in a animated conversation as bikini clad RiRi is seen pointing her right index finger in the air with her mouth open, looking like she had something important to say. In another pic Hassan is seen looking back at her with his hand on his chest as if they’re involved in a somewhat heated conversation. CLICK HERE to see all the pics.  On June 1 MediaTakeOut claimed RiRi had dumped Hassan. The site reported that “Rihanna just got tired of him. She gets tired of men sometimes,” an alleged insider told them. They said that the handsome billionaire wasn’t doing too well after the split. “Of course Rihanna broke his heart. That’s what she does — break men’s hearts.” Since Rihanna has never commented on her romance with Hassan and goes to great lengths to keep their relationship away from the public eye, MTO’s report spread like wildfire.  Obviously something is still on between Rihanna and Hassan, as they are having a hot summer together. They were first photographed a year ago making out in a pool in Spain. They’ve only been pictured a handful of times since, keeping their love undercover. The “Work” singer’s previous relationship was with Drake, 31, and it played out in public. He even professed his years of love to her in front of the world while presenting her with the Video Vanguard award at the 2016 VMAs. After having the public know all about their dating business, Ri has wisely kept her romance with Hassan as far out of the public eye as possible.  Rihanna revealed recently that Drake gushing about her on live TV made her cringe. In a May 2018 interview with Vogue, she said “Waiting through that speech was probably the most uncomfortable part. I don’t like too many compliments; I don’t like to be put on blast.” As for where she stands with Drizzy, she told the mag that they haven’t spoken and that “We don’t have a friendship now, but we’re not enemies either. It is what it is.” However she did come the close to discussing her relationship with Hassan, telling the publication that she dating and she is happy. “I used to feel guilty about taking personal time,” she revealed, “but I also think I never met someone who was worth it before,” she said about her romance with Hassan.","The 30-year-old singer also revealed that she is in no rush to walk down the aisle anytime soon. “I’m not really sure about marriage. I think I’ve been through enough in my life to know that I don’t want to settle for something that doesn’t feel right.” When asked about having kids, Rihanna said, “I’m not really sure about kids. I think I would like to have a family, but I’m not sure if I want to have kids. I’m just not there yet.” Rihanna and Hassan are still going strong after one year of dating, despite rumors of a split. The couple was spotted on a sexy Mexican getaway last week, where they were seen having a heated conversation.

gossipcop-6909849467,1,1,"Now, it’s official: Star Wars fans will have one final chance to say goodbye to Carrie Fisher, with Lucasfilm announcing that the actress, who died in December 2016, will appear in next year’s Star Wars: Episode IX.  In a statement, director J.J. Abrams sought to put concerns about potential CGI resurrections to rest, saying that the new movie will use “unseen footage we shot together in Episode VII” and assuring fans that “we were never going to recast, or use a CG character.” While this is, undoubtedly, comforting, it would also appear to offer particular clues about the role Fisher — or, more specifically, her character, Leia Organa — will play in the movie.  Firstly: Purely for practical purposes, Leia’s presence in the movie will be small. If nothing else, there can’t be that much extraneous, unseen footage from 2015's Star Wars: The Force Awakens; she was barely in that movie, so unless large swaths of scenes were shot but never even hinted at by anyone involved in the production, there’s limited material to draw from in the first place, and surely not everything available will be used.  Considering the context of the footage, it also limits the potential use for Episode IX. Leia appeared in few scenes and locations in The Force Awakens. Leia was on Takodana, rescuing Han, Chewbacca, Rey and Finn, and then at the Resistance base on D’Qar, where she takes part in planning, and later monitoring, the attack on Starkiller Base. Aside from brief interludes with Han and, later, Rey, she’s very much in “harried leader” mode throughout the movie. Does this mean that this is the Leia we’ll see in Episode IX, even after losing her ex-husband, and then her brother, in the previous two movies?  (It’s possible that the Fisher footage will end up being just a minor flashback, used to punctuate a contemporary moment; memories during her funeral, as some on social media have already suggested. If so, then the above problem is side-stepped, to a degree.)  Abrams’ comments leave space for some level of postproduction trickery to be applied to the Fisher footage. Presumably, Fisher will be intercut with new footage of actors shot specifically for Episode IX. Will digital trickery be used to make sure that Fisher shares a location with the other cast members? If so, will that be all that’s altered? What about costuming choices? For that matter, what about the potential for posthumous dubbing or soundalikes used for dialogue where Leia is off-camera or not in close-up? Abrams said that the movie would never use a CG character, but what about a performance augmented or altered by CG?  Of course, if any such edits or alterations are made, they’ll have to be done with subtlety and sensitivity. This is key to the entire enterprise of including footage of Fisher posthumously. For as much as fans want to be able to say goodbye to the actress, and also to Leia, they want to do so in a manner that feels appropriate and respectful to both. While Abrams and Lucasfilm — and Fisher’s family, especially daughter Billie Lourd, named in Abrams’ statement — want to provide both closure and tribute to Leia and Fisher alike with this move, they’re courting backlash if this isn’t done perfectly.  That the footage will come from The Force Awakens feels particularly fitting, then; that, after all, was a project that already came with expectations and looming accusations from fandom expecting the worst. It’s also perhaps a reminder that those involved with this move love the mythology — and loved Fisher as a person — as much as anyone else, if not more so, and will be approaching it with the utmost care.  Everyone will, inevitably, remain worried until the final product appears onscreen, but perhaps we can rest just slightly in the meantime.","Now that it’s official that Carrie Fisher will appear in Star Wars: Episode IX, fans are eagerly anticipating how her character, Princess Leia Organa, will be incorporated into the film.  While director J.J. Abrams has assured fans that the late actress’s footage will not be digitally recreated or recast, he has also hinted that the new movie will use “unseen footage we shot together in Episode VII.”  As a result, many are speculating about the role Leia will play in the movie and how her limited appearance will be handled.  According to Abrams, Leia’s presence in the film will be “small,” but it’s unclear how much of the unseen footage from The Force Awakens will be used.  The footage that will be used is likely to be from scenes shot on Takodana and at the Resistance base on D’Qar, where Leia appears in a leadership role.  It’s possible that the Fisher footage will be used in flashbacks or during Leia’s funeral, but Abrams has also hinted that the movie will use digital trickery to make sure that Fisher shares a location with the other cast members.  While fans are eager to see Fisher’s final appearance in the Star Wars franchise, it’s clear that the filmmakers are taking a sensitive and respectful approach to incorporating her footage into the movie."

The talk show host on Sunday posted a photo on Instagram of him and his wife boarding a private jet.  “Vacation time is here, let’s go girl,” he captioned the Sunday, July 8 image.  The photo, which was similar to one Marjorie posted on her Instagram Story, got praise from fans.  “God bless….. stay focus[ed] don’t [lose] the vision🙏💍.”  “Enjoy yourselves, you guys deserve this vacation. Come back well rested and a stronger bond and marriage. Yahoo for the Harveys.”  Days earlier, RadarOnline reported that Marjorie walked out on Steve because he had been getting close with Kris Jenner during closed-door business meetings and ongoing phone calls and text messages.  “There was a huge blowout fight and Marjorie walked out threatening divorce,” a source told the gossip site of the reported split. “There’s no way she was going to put up with Steve hanging around a man-eater like Kris — especially since he’s proven time and again he can’t be trusted.”  Although Jenner was reportedly just stringing Steve along to get tips on TV success, one of his former talk show employes said Marjorie knows her man, who is twice divorced and cheated on both wives with the next.  “Steve has a wandering eye and he loves women!” the ex-worker told Radar anonymously. “He’s cheated during his previous marriages, and Marjorie knows he could do it again. She knows her man’s weakness — knows everything about him! That’s why she watches him so closely.”  The rumor was the talk of Twitter.  “Am I late?? Did everyone know Steve Harvey is being accused of cheating on Marjorie with Kris Jenner?! I didn’t know this 😂.”  “Steve Harvey left his wife to marry Marjorie, his side b—- of 20 years, and now she’s leaving him and running his pockets. Hilarious.

She played him like a violin 🎻😂.”  The rumors surrounding Steve and Marjorie’s marriage began after a source told RadarOnline that the pair were headed for a $400 million divorce.  “Marjorie has had enough of Steve’s cheating ways and his constant lying. She’s done with him and is ready to move on with her life,” the source claimed.  Although Marjorie has yet to comment on the rumors, her recent vacation post with Steve suggests that all may not be lost.  “Vacation time is here, let’s go girl,” Steve captioned the post.  “God bless….. stay focused[ed] don’t [lose] the vision🙏💍.”  “Enjoy yourselves, you guys deserve this vacation.

A replica of the world’s most famous “unsinkable” ship — which struck an iceberg and sank on its maiden voyage on April 15, 1912, killing 1,503 people — is under construction, with a maiden voyage planned for 2018.  Australian tycoon and politician Clive Palmer — not J. Bruce Ismay — is at the helm of the ambitious project to faithfully recreate the luxury ship, which will be about 13 feet wider to meet current regulations.  More importantly, it will carry enough lifeboats for every passenger and its hull will be welded, not riveted, just in case it comes across a rogue iceberg, the Belfast Telegraph reports.  “The new Titanic will of course have modern evacuation procedures, satellite controls, digital navigation and radar systems and all those things you’d expect on a 21st-century ship,” James McDonald, global marketing director of Palmer’s company, Blue Star Line, told the paper.  The new nine-deck ship will be 885 feet long, about two more than her doomed predecessor, 174 feet high and have a maximum speed of 24 knots. She will accommodate 2,400 passengers — 177 more than the RMS Titanic.  It also will feature the same categories of passengers — from the first-class movers and shakers to the hoi polloi in third class, where poor Leonardo DiCaprio was berthed in the classic movie.  Unlike the Belfast-built original, the Titanic II is under construction by the CSC Jinling Shipyard in Jiangsu, China.  Its maiden voyage will not be from Southampton to New York, but rather from Jiangsu, China, to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, the paper reported.

gossipcop-8581615474,1,1,"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired. T","ensions between Holmes and Foxx have been simmering for weeks, according to reports.  On New Year’s Eve, Foxx and Grannis were spotted at a party in Los Angeles, leading to speculation that the two are still in contact and possibly even seeing each other.  
Paraphrased: Poor Katie Holmes is dealing with a string of challenges in her personal life. She recently called off her wedding to boyfriend Jamie Foxx due to his unwillingness to sign a prenuptial agreement with a no-cheating clause. Meanwhile, her ex-husband Tom Cruise is reportedly trying to rekindle his relationship with their daughter Suri, despite the fact that Holmes agreed to stay quiet about their relationship in exchange for Cruise staying away from their daughter. Holmes is torn between what's best for Suri and her own desires, and is slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion with Cruise. However, representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion."
