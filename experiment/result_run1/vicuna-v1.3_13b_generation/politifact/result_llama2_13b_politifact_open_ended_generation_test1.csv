PHEEEEEWWWW, that would have been too much to handle.Houston – It seems new National Rifle Association President (NRA) president Jim Porter may have found himself in a bit of hot water. Not long ago he made his feelings about the Civil War known when he referred to it as the “War of Northern Aggression.” In that same speech he referred to President Obama as a “fake president” and Attorney General Eric Holder as “rabidly un-American.” However none of those remarks that anyone could deem as racist compare to his remarks made at a recent press conference discussing his new leadership role at the NRA.“I’m very proud to be taking the lead here at the NRA. We need to really buckle down and strap on our best arguments to defend what is our God-given rights. No more northern folk tryin’ take away what is rightfully ours. I will not stand by and let some liberal-elitists try to ruin what has made this country great, especially a liberal of, you know, a different breed.”When asked to clarify Porter said,“I don’t have to clarify. You know gall darn well what I mean. In fact, it’s only a matter of time before we can own colored people again. They sure as hell won’t be our leaders. It’s out-right embarrassing. The War of Northern Aggression made it all possible, and you be best to know it’s all gonna change back. I’ll be on the front lines making sure it happens. I don’t want my grandkids growing up taking orders from a colored man. It’s our God-given right to keep them as property and keep them in line.”Several at the NRA, including vice president Wayne LaPierre, have since tried to distance themselves from Porter’s remarks. LaPierre said, “They brought him in over me to try and liven things up, calling me boring and rehearsed. Next time they’d be better off just making me president.”-- ADVERTISEMENT --It’s still unknown if the NRA and Porter will write an apology and retraction to his comments. Free Wood Post will keep you up to date as this story unfolds.Source: http://www.freewoodpost.com/2013/05/05/nra-president-jim-porter-its-only-a-matter-of-time-before-we-can-own-colored-people-again/PUBLIC NOTE: The opinions expressed in this article are the author's own and do not reflect the view of the Urban Intellectuals, affiliates or partners. -- ADVERTISEMENT -- DO YOU AGREE OUR HISTORY IS IMPORTANT?

The comment, which was attributed to Porter, suggested that the NRA had a ""hit list"" of lawmakers who were targeted for defeat in the 2022 midterm elections.

The comment, which was widely reported on by major news outlets, caused a firestorm of controversy, with many accusing the NRA of engaging in political intimidation and bullying. The organization was forced to issue a statement denying the claims, but the damage had already been done.

Fast forward to this week, when it was discovered that the comment was, in fact, a fabrication. The NRA announced that an internal investigation had found that the comment was not made by Porter and that the organization had no such hit list.

In a statement, the NRA said, ""We apologize for the confusion and misinformation that has been spread. Our organization values transparency and honesty, and we are committed to ensuring that the public has access to accurate information about our operations.""

Porter himself has not commented on the matter, but it is clear that the controversy has left a black eye on his tenure as NRA president. The organization has long been a lightning rod for controversy, but this latest incident has only added fuel to the fire."

The O has been replaced with a transformed version of Obama’s campaign slogan, with the American flag replaced by flames. There is also an all-seeing eye in the center. It’s pretty clear what the agenda is of this traitor we knew was an American-hating globalist all along:Along with two small islands due east of Virginia just in international waters, Obama’s “team” has now set up massive complexes with billions in equipment and spying technology outside of Washington DC, New York and Los Angeles. Chicago would have been a better choice for population than Washington but if your end game is to launch a military coup in the nation’s capital, those pieces must be deeply embedded in place.How embedded? Obama himself lives within the city limits. He conducts secret meetings with top-ranking officials from both parties and diplomats from around the world in a mansion that is a part of the old Washington tunnel system, built after the British trashed the city and burned down the White House in 1812.The extent of the tunnels is unknown since they remain the property of the US Government and require codeword clearance. There is no map available. Historians have pieced together several of the stops, however, and Tracey Place — along with just about every other building that houses a public official in DC — is on the list.This is no joke, patriots.

politifact14992,1,0,"Do you really believe that as the countries of the Middle East empty out, and their degenerates are vomited out upon the Western World, ...","As the countries of the Middle East continue to undergo significant transformations, it is becoming increasingly evident that their populations are being displaced and forced to seek refuge in other parts of the world. This alarming trend has been exacerbated by the ongoing conflicts, political instability, and economic hardships that have plagued the region for decades. As a result, many of the Middle East's most vulnerable citizens, including refugees and displaced persons, are being displaced and forced to flee to other countries in search of safety and security.

One of the most concerning aspects of this issue is the fact that many of these individuals are often subjected to extreme forms of violence, exploitation, and abuse, both during their journeys and upon their arrival in their new countries of residence. In addition, the sheer number of refugees and displaced persons has put a significant strain on the resources and infrastructure of many host countries, leading to a range of social and economic challenges.

Despite these challenges, many governments and international organizations are working tirelessly to provide support and assistance to those in need. This includes efforts to provide basic necessities such as food, shelter, and medical care, as well as initiatives aimed at promoting social and economic integration and providing opportunities for education and employment.

Overall, the ongoing displacement of individuals from the Middle East is a complex and multifaceted issue that requires a comprehensive and coordinated response from the international community. While the situation remains dire for many, there is hope that with continued efforts and support, a more stable and prosperous future can be achieved for those affected by this crisis."

Joe Kennedy III (D-MA) claimed the host-city of his response to President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address, Fall River, Massachusetts was “built by immigrants.”Fact-Check: MOSTLY FALSEWhat is now Fall River was first established in the 1600s by English settlers who were not “immigrants” but colonists. A native-born family, the Bordens ran a mill in what became the town for generations before and after the American revolution. Industrialization began when Col. Joseph Durfee, a native-born Revolutionary War hero built the first factory in 1811. Later, at the end of the 19th Century a wave of immigrants swelled the town’s population. Immigrants, however, never made up a majority of the population of Bristol County, where Fall River lies, even at their early 20th Century peak.","Rep. Joe Kennedy III (D-MA) has recently claimed that the host-city of his response to President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address, Fall River, Massachusetts, was “built by immigrants”. Kennedy made this statement during a press conference held at the Fall River City Hall, where he was joined by local officials and community leaders.

Kennedy, who represents Massachusetts’ 4th congressional district, emphasized the significance of immigration in the history and development of Fall River. He highlighted the contributions of immigrants from various countries, such as Portugal, Ireland, and later, Latin America, who came to the city seeking better opportunities and helped to build its infrastructure, industries, and communities.

“The story of Fall River is the story of America,” Kennedy said. “It is a story of hard work, determination, and perseverance. It is a story of immigrants who came to this country with nothing and built a life for themselves and their families.”

The congressman’s remarks come at a time when immigration has become a highly contentious issue in the United States. Trump’s administration has implemented strict immigration policies, including the controversial travel ban, which has been widely criticized by Democrats and civil rights groups.

Kennedy’s remarks also follow a recent announcement by the White House that it will be moving forward with plans to hold the next State of the Union address in the House chamber, despite opposition from Democrats. The speech, which was originally scheduled for January 29, was postponed due to the ongoing government shutdown.

In his response to Trump’s address, Kennedy criticized the president’s policies on immigration and other issues, calling for a more inclusive and compassionate approach to governing. He also emphasized the importance of working together to address pressing challenges facing the nation, such as healthcare, climate change, and income inequality.

Overall, Kennedy’s comments highlight the significance of immigration in the history and identity of Fall River, and serve as a reminder of the important contributions that immigrants have made to the city and the country as a whole."

The former athlete was reportedly found unconscious by his uncle, who called emergency services immediately. He was then rushed to the hospital, where he is currently receiving treatment for his injuries.

The news of Pistorius' attempted suicide has shocked the world, with many expressing concern for his well-being and calling for support for those struggling with mental health issues.

Meanwhile, the South African government has promised to provide the necessary support to ensure that justice is served in the case, while also ensuring that Pistorius receives the medical care he needs.

In a statement, the government said: ""We are deeply saddened by the news of Oscar Pistorius' attempted suicide. Our thoughts and prayers are with him and his family during this difficult time. We will do everything in our power to ensure that justice is served and that Pistorius receives the medical care he needs.""

Thanks to Medicaid he’s being treated for cancer. During the CNN town hall with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, Kline explained his situation and his struggles. “My question is pretty straightforward,” Kline told Price. “Why do you want to take away my Medicaid expansion?” Price’s dispassionate answer seemed to fall flat on the audience. “I took care of a lot of patients with cancer,” Price explained about his 20 years as an orthopedic surgeon. “We don’t want to take care away from anybody. What we want to make certain, though, is that every single American has access to the kind of coverage and care that they want for themselves.”“But, what if there are people out there who are going to die more quickly because of what you’re doing here, because you’re essentially taking medical care away from people who need it the most?” Kline wouldn’t back down. “Are you saying you actually want people to be okay with that?” Price thought for a second, then replied: “Look, I understand how all of this sounds right now, but you know, there comes a time in everyone’s life when they just have to stop talking B.S. and be practical. As of right now, the fact to the matter is, our national budget is hemorrhaging money because of Obamacare. And believe me – I get how insensitive that sounds, but at the end of the day, we have to stop ignoring the facts here.”He continued, “I understand that this is not something anyone wants to hear, especially people who’ve got worse problems to deal with than the state of the national budget, but this is one of those situations where the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. When President Trump assumed office, he was appalled at the state of the national budget and our finances. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that Barack Obama was to blame, since he’s the one who left the hot potato behind for us to deal with. Now, I’m not going to go into whether or not he did that on purpose, but at the end of the day, all I can say is, we have to fix the problem or else we’re looking at nationwide riots and another economic recession.”“Put simply, we have to plug some holes – of which, by the way, there are plenty – and we kind of have to start with the biggest ones,” the orthopedic surgeon added. “Unfortunately for millions of people across the country, Obamacare seems to be the biggest one by far. Besides, there are more ways than one to look at this picture. I know it’s not pretty, but at the end of the day, even people who are able to fight off cancer – I’m sure you know what I’m talking about, Brian – they can’t lead 100 percent normal lives, ever again. What kind of an existence is that, to have to survive instead of live?”“At the risk of sounding insensitive, we’ve pretty much got two choices here: we either repeal Obamacare, or we take out more loans from countries like China. And nobody wants to be in debt to the Chinese. At the end of the day, it’s better for our national budget if cancer patients pass away more quickly, it’s a lousy way to live anyway, and I’m sorry to say it out loud, but it’s the truth,” Price concluded.",Kline has a high school diploma and is not interested in furthering his education. He’s also not a fan of the president’s tweets.

""Inside, we both know what's been going on. We know the game and we're gonna play it,"" said Trump.Governance involves taking difficult steps, said the US president, adding that despite Facebook taking action against fake news, a lot of false stories and 'alternative facts' were still being circulated on the site.Other social websites like Twitter and Instagram, though, will be excluded from the executive order.The people working for Facebook are not happy about this selective exclusion.Rick Rowlinson, a source from Facebook, said that even if the ban on Facebook was actually meant to fight against fake news, the President's ""commitment"" should have not just been limited to Facebook. ""You know the rules and so do I. A full commitment's what I'm thinking of,"" Rowlinson said. ""You wouldn't get this from any other guy,"" he added, shaking his head.In California, where Facebook is based, a large section of people have already begun protesting against this move.Courts in the US had earlier blocked Trump's travel ban executive order.Keen on supporting the President, Vice President Mike Pence has also said that he will support the executive order if it is passed by Trump.Reacting to this proposed order, Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that Facebook will continue to run its operations from California even if the site is banned in the US.On Trump's claim to fight fake news, Zuckerberg said that an outright ban was not the correct way to fight false news.Last month, reports were saying that a court in Pakistan was mulling action against Facebook over 'blasphemous content'.Lately, there have been some countries speaking out against social media websites.

Experts have been quoted as saying that the move could have far-reaching implications for the tech industry and free speech, as well as for US-Russia relations. The US government has been investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, and has accused Russia of using social media to influence the outcome. Facebook has denied any wrongdoing, but has said that it is committed to working with the US government to prevent any further interference in future elections.

===============================================================

In a shocking turn of events, Miley Cyrus, the pop star and actress, took to Instagram on Tuesday to voice her opposition to the possibility of Donald Trump becoming the next President of the United States. Cyrus, who has over 38 million followers on the social media platform, used a profanity in her post to express her frustration and dismay at the prospect of a Trump presidency.

Cyrus's comments came in the wake of Trump's Super Tuesday victories, which have put him in a strong position to secure the Republican nomination for the presidency. Trump's win has sent shockwaves through the political establishment and has raised concerns about the future of the country if he were to be elected.

Cyrus's opposition to Trump is not surprising given the singer's history of speaking out on political and social issues. She has been an outspoken advocate for LGBT rights and has used her platform to raise awareness about issues such as sexual assault and animal welfare.

In her post, Cyrus urged her followers to vote in the upcoming election and to reject the divisive and hateful rhetoric that has characterized Trump's campaign.

It was also revealed earlier this week that Alex Jones (real name “Alexi Jonesinov”) is a Russian sleeper agent who was ordered by the FSB (formerly the KGB) to post news articles on the internet saying that Donald Trump would be a good President.However, the revelation that 62 million Americans are taking orders directly from the Kremlin is a revelation of a whole other order, which FBI agents are struggling with how to deal with.It was determined by Puerto Rican federal judge Mizu Tomazaki that it is a crime to support Donald Trump or to post positive things about him on the internet. 9th circuit judges Weinberg, Steinman and Goldenstein upheld the ruling. Despite this, the logistics of rounding up 62 million people and locking them in prison present a difficult task to overcome.It may also be that not every voter is a direct agent of the FSB (formerly the KGB), and some may have been under the control of a mind control beam in space.“We have not determined for sure that everyone who voted for Trump was paid directly by the Kremlin, given that it is highly possible that the Russians used a space-beam from a satellite to control their brains from a facility in St. Petersburg, and moved their bodies like puppets to the polls to check the Trump box,” one current agent familiar with the investigation told the times, describing the process of using a satellite-mounted space-beam to control people’s actions as “Russian neuro-brain hacking.”When asked for comment on these reports by The Times, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the allegations of space-beam mind control by the FSB (formerly the KGB) were “ridiculous,” “outrageous” and “goofy.” However, Peskov suspiciously asked “vere is Moose and Squirrel?”NSA chief Mike Rogers said that though it is a well-established fact that going all the way back to Soviet times, the Russians have used space-beams to control people’s brains, he’s “never seen anything on this scale before.”The Times also sought comment from President Trump; however, when asked about these allegations, he began screaming in Russian and jumped in a big truck and drove off down the road.You are all nuts…almost 1/2 of America voted to make Trump the legal president, and you keep teling us we don’t matter.

The evidence, which is said to be irrefutable, includes data from social media accounts, email correspondence, and financial transactions.

The news outlet said chants by monument supporters included “Where’s Mitch?” while opponents chanted, “Hey hey, ho ho, white supremacy has got to go.”As Fox news reported earlier, the mayor’s plan calls for the Davis statue to be melted down and cast into smaller statues of Black Lives Matter leaders.","Workers in New Orleans dismantled the city's Jefferson Davis monument early Thursday, removing the prominent statue of the Confederate leader that had stood for more than 100 years. The removal of the statue, which was erected in 1911, was carried out in accordance with a city council vote in 2015 to remove Confederate monuments that some argue glorify racism and white supremacy. The action sparked mixed reactions, with some hailing the move as a step towards healing the city's racial divide, while others expressed disappointment and dismay over the loss of a piece of history.

The Jefferson Davis monument was the first of four Confederate monuments to be removed in New Orleans, following a long-standing debate over the appropriateness of such symbols in public spaces. The city's decision to take down the monuments has been met with both praise and criticism, with some arguing that the move is an attempt to erase history, while others see it as an important step towards promoting inclusivity and diversity.

The dismantling of the Jefferson Davis monument marks a significant moment in the ongoing conversation around Confederate symbols and their place in American society. The debate over whether such monuments should be removed has gained national attention in recent years, with cities across the country grappling with the question of how to balance historical preservation with the need to address the pain and harm caused by these symbols. As the country continues to grapple with issues of race and inequality, the removal of the Jefferson Davis monument serves as a reminder of the ongoing struggle for social justice and the need to confront the past in order to move towards a more inclusive and equitable future."

What Israeli military leaders really worry about — but cannot talk about — is losing their nuclear monopoly.An Iranian nuclear weapons capability would not only end that nuclear monopoly but could also prompt other adversaries, like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, to go nuclear as well. The result would be a precarious nuclear balance in which Israel could not respond to provocations with conventional military strikes on Syria and Lebanon, as it can today.If Iran were to reach the threshold of a nuclear weapons state, Tehran would find it much easier to call on its allies in Syria and Hezbollah to strike Israel, knowing that its nuclear weapons would serve as a deterrent to Israel responding against Iran itself.It is, Clinton continues, the “strategic relationship between Iran and the regime of Bashar Assad in Syria” that makes it possible for Iran to undermine Israel’s security.This would not come about through a “direct attack,” Clinton admits, because “in the thirty years of hostility between Iran and Israel” this has never occurred, but through its alleged “proxies.”The end of the Assad regime would end this dangerous alliance. Israel’s leadership understands well why defeating Assad is now in its interests.Bringing down Assad would not only be a massive boon to Israel’s security, it would also ease Israel’s understandable fear of losing its nuclear monopoly.Then, Israel and the United States might be able to develop a common view of when the Iranian program is so dangerous that military action could be warranted.Clinton goes on to asset that directly threatening Bashar Assad “and his family” with violence is the “right thing” to do:In short, the White House can ease the tension that has developed with Israel over Iran by doing the right thing in Syria.With his life and his family at risk, only the threat or use of force will change the Syrian dictator Bashar Assad’s mind.The email prov","A leaked Hillary Clinton email has confirmed that the Obama administration, with Hillary at the helm, orchestrated a civil war in Syria to benefit Israel.

politifact15224,1,0,"BREAKING: Barack Obama just secretly fled the U.S. after Donald Trump found some disturbing criminal evidence he left behind in the Oval Office. This prompted Trump to send a massive warning to Obama and his deep state minions that they won’t soon forget!Mad World News reported that Obama just jetted off to New Zealand this week, and he immediately imposed a strict ban on the media covering the events he plans to hold there. It should come as no surprise that Obama chose to leave the country right now, however, as the heat was just turned up on his deep state after the firing of now former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.In the wake of this firing, it was confirmed that Obama left behind a trail of damning evidence inside the Oval Office. The evidence proves that it was actually the Obama administration that colluded with Russia to thwart then-candidate Donald Trump during the presidential election, and they didn’t cover their tracks well enough.The members of Obama’s deep state that took part in this plan included ormer FBI Director James Comey, former National Security Advisor Susan Rice, former UN Ambassador Samantha Powers, and Lisa Monaco, who was the head of the DOJ National Security Division. Monaco slipped up and left an evidence trail going from the illegal unmasking of US citizens being done, Trump and his campaign people, under the illegal FISA warrants, back to the Oval Office via the “Presidential Daily Briefings” (PDB).“During the 2015/2016 presidential election, Lisa Monaco was one of the key WH figures doing the unmasking of raw intelligence provided by the ‘small group’ collaborators (with Susan Rice, Ben Rhodes). Monaco was also one of the key policy strategists, heck, she was the architect, who utilized the compartmentalization of intelligence to hide the fingerprints of collaboration. This was the issue that initially stymied HSPCI Devin Nunes,” reported The Conservative Treehouse.Nunes eventually found Obama’s PDBs which have all the illegal FISA activity and other illegal spy games targeting Trump.“Nunes stated the intelligence product he reviewed was ‘not related to Russia, or the FBI Russian counter-intelligence investigation.’ So the product itself was likely a product for the President, that was not part of the ongoing FBI counter-intel product,” reported The Conservative Treehouse.These PDBs prove Obama was in on this from the very beginning, and he hasn’t stopped trying to take Trump down since then. Last month, Obama and his deep state set up a website called “National Security Action,” who says their mission is, “Under President Trump’s reckless leadership, the United States is weaker in the world, less safe, and more isolated. He is retreating from the world stage, undercutting the intelligence and law enforcement agencies that keep us safe, undermining the diplomacy that prevents wars, insulting our allies, attacking democratic traditions, and cozying up to dictators while abandoning America’s commitment to universal rights and human dignity.”These people are just trying to get Trump impeached so they can swoop in and take back the White House as soon as he is out of it. Unfortunately for them, however, McCabe’s firing makes it clear that they won’t get away with this act of treason.What do you think about this?

Foster’s death in 1993 had been ruled a suicide..With new evidence, Rep. Trey Gowdy successfully petitioned a federal judge to have the body of Vince Foster exhumed for autopsy. The body wasn’t autopsied before burial the first time, which aided in the theory of a cover-up. Forensic specialists examined the body last night at the Naval Hospital in Norfolk, Virginia, concluding that the cause of death for Mr. Foster should be changed from suicide to homicide..LT Col. James McFitting, head of the hospital’s forensics lab, told reporters in his office that Foster had not one but two gunshot wounds, both of which would have been fatal.

We’re not going to give it to them, folks. They’re going to have to earn their citizenship.”Trump has repeatedly stated that he won’t rule out using nuclear weapons against the Islamic State. On Thursday he expanded on his claims, saying he would instruct the Pentagon to begin testing “man-portable” tactical nuclear weapons to be used by American soldiers on the battlefield. “We’re not going to have unquestionable military dominance if we’re seen as too weak to use these weapons against our enemies.”Rather than use conventional means such as drone strikes or economic sanctions to respond to acts of terrorism or other forms of aggression against the United States, Trump vowed to exercise the nuclear option “extremely” liberally. “My feeling is we have these weapons and we’ve spent a great deal of money developing and improving them over the years; there’s absolutely no reason why we shouldn’t be using them.”The former reality TV star accused President Obama of making the country less safe by employing tact and diplomacy when dealing with foreign leaders. “This guy’s the president of the United States and he’s bowing to the Chinese.

Costa Mesa, California – In a bold move aimed at revitalizing the U.S. military, Republican presidential front-runner and billionaire entrepreneur Donald Trump has announced his intention to reinstate the draft as part of a comprehensive strategy to strengthen America's armed forces.

Speaking to a packed auditorium in Costa Mesa, Trump declared that the United States must 'make the military great again' in order to protect its interests both at home and abroad. To achieve this goal, he argued, the country must reinstitute the draft, which he claimed would help to create a more equitable and effective military.

Trump's proposal has been met with a mix of support and skepticism, with some praising the plan as a necessary step towards rebuilding the military and others questioning the feasibility and ethics of reinstating the draft.

politifact15334,1,0,"‘Smallville’ star Allison Mack has confessed that she sold children to the Rothschilds and Clintons during her time in the child sex cult.According to police, Allison Mack worked in a senior management position for the Hollywood pedophile cult NXIVM. As second-in-command, it was her job to lure children into the cult in order to sell them to elite Hollywood pedophiles and powerful politicians.Thefreethoughtproject.com reports: “As alleged in the indictment, Allison Mack recruited women to join what was purported to be a female mentorship group that was, in fact, created and led by Keith Raniere. The victims were then exploited, both sexually and for their labor, to the defendants’ benefit,” U.S. Attorney Richard P. Donoghue said in a statement.The cult was finally exposed when the daughter of former Dynasty actress Catherine Oxenberg became a member. Oxenberg told the New York Times that she became concerned after she saw that her 26-year-old daughter India was extremely emaciated from dieting, and was suffering from serious health problems.“Some people have said this is a voluntary sorority. The women I have spoken to tell a far different story,” Oxenberg said. “Coercion is not voluntary. Extortion is not voluntary. Blackmail is not voluntary.”When these accusations hit the news, other women, including actress Sarah Edmondson, came forward to all to tell the same story, of the blackmail, the branding, as well as the forced labor and forced sexual activity.Raniere is also accused of having a history of pedophilia, with accusations that stretch back over 20 years, involving girls as young as 12.In 2012, several women were interviewed by the Albany Times Union about the coercive sexual experiences that they had with Raniere when they were young girls. One of the women in the case was found dead of a gunshot wound before she was able to give the interview. Her death was ruled a suicide.The U.S. attorney’s office requested to have Raniere held without bail in a letter to the court stating that he was a known child predator.Although this extremely important detail is being left out of most mainstream reports, one of the main charges in the criminal indictment against Raniere and Mack is sex trafficking of children.A quick search for Allison Mack’s arrest report or charges—as reported by the mainstream media—will not yield any mention of children. Most mainstream reports only mention sex trafficking and ominously omit that the charges were for sex trafficking of children. Exactly why the media is refusing to report this remains a mystery.Another important aspect of this case that has been largely overlooked, is the connections that this organization has to high-level figures in politics and finance. The organization worked much like a pyramid scheme, collecting regular fees from its members. But the majority of the funding, over $150 million, came from the trust funds of Seagram heiresses, Sara and Clare Bronfman.Their involvement with Raniere began in 2002 and has been very public and controversial, with other members of the Bronfman family distancing themselves from the sisters in the press. The Bronfman family has very close ties to the Rothschild banking dynasty, with members of both families belonging to many of the same companies, including their joint financial firm, Bronfman & Rothschild.Additionally, at least three high-ranking members of the organization, including Nancy Salzman and the Bronfman sisters, are members of Bill Clinton’s foundation, the Clinton Global Initiative, which requires an annual $15,000 membership fee.Now that Raniere is in jail and Mack is on bail and ordered not to have any contact with other cult members, Clare Bronfman has taken on the role of leader within the organization.In response to the recent controversy surrounding NXIVM, Bronfman made a statement on her website denying the accusations against Raniere.

New York, May 10th, 2023 - In a shocking revelation, Allison Mack, known for her role in the popular television series 'Smallville', has come forward with a confession that has sent shockwaves throughout the entertainment industry and beyond. Mack, who was a member of the now-infamous child sex cult NXIVM, has admitted to selling children to the Rothschilds and Clintons during her time in the group.

The news of Mack's confession has been met with disbelief and outrage, as many struggle to come to terms with the magnitude of her alleged crimes. NXIVM, led by the now-deceased Keith Raniere, was a secretive organization that allegedly exploited its members through sex trafficking, brainwashing, and other forms of abuse.

Mack's admission of involvement in the sale of children to wealthy and powerful individuals has further fueled the controversy surrounding NXIVM and its alleged practices. The former actress, who has been in custody since her arrest in 2018, is reportedly cooperating with authorities in their ongoing investigation into the cult's activities.

As the investigation continues, many are left to question how such alleged atrocities could have gone unnoticed for so long, and what steps must be taken to ensure that justice is served for the victims of NXIVM. The case has also sparked a broader conversation about the prevalence of sex trafficking and exploitation in the entertainment industry and beyond, and the urgent need for greater awareness and action to combat these heinous crimes."

Meanwhile, supporters of the Pope's statement argue that the proliferation of weapons has led to an increase in violent crimes and that disarming the population is the only way to achieve peace. They point to other countries that have implemented gun control measures as examples of successful policies.

The Pope's call for gun confiscation has also sparked a debate about the role of religion in politics. Some argue that the Pope should not be involved in political issues, while others see his statement as a moral imperative to act.

In a 5-3 decision, that was not a difficult interpretation of the constitution, the high court ruled that public school is the United States will not teach the tenets of Islam or Sharia Law.According to our source, USA Politics Today, the students will learn about Islam in history, as they do Christianity and all other religions, only as it pertains to the time period they are studying.Judge Neil Gorsuch wrote, “The government certainly has no business being involved in religion, but this isn’t a government issue or a religious issue. This is about the judicial branch interpreting the laws as they apply to the teaching of religion.We should be teaching any religions in this country besides standard Judeo-Christianity, as our founders wanted, and we certainly shouldn’t be filling the children with lies about Islam being a ‘religion of peace’ when they see the carnage on the news almost every day.”Gorsuch continued, “It is our duty as Americans first and judges second to safeguard the way our children are indoctrinated.”The Obama Administration forced the children to learn about Islam as the “Religion of Peace,” only so that they could be more tolerant of the terrorists.

In a unanimous decision, the nine-member bench ruled in favor of the President, effectively overturning a lower court's ruling that had been widely reported by the media.

The case in question involved the President's decision to block users on his personal Twitter account, a move that had been challenged by a group of individuals who claimed that their First Amendment rights had been violated. However, the Supreme Court disagreed, stating that the President's Twitter account is a private platform and that he has the right to block whomever he wishes, including those with opposing viewpoints.

This decision has significant implications for free speech and the role of social media in political discourse. It also serves as a reminder that the mainstream media is not always a reliable source of information and that it is important to approach news stories with a critical eye.

The mainstream media has been widely criticized for its biased coverage of the Trump Administration, and this latest ruling is sure to fuel further controversy. However, it is important to note that the Supreme Court's decision was based on the law and the Constitution, not on political affiliations or personal beliefs.

In a statement, President Trump praised the decision, stating that it was a victory for free speech and the First Amendment. He also took a swipe at the media, saying that the ruling was a ""big win for me and for all Americans who value their First Amendment rights.""

The introduction of the ban has been welcomed by health experts who have long warned about the dangers of second-hand smoke to children. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), exposure to tobacco smoke can cause a range of health problems in children, including respiratory illnesses, ear infections and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).

In addition to the health risks, the ban is also expected to have a positive impact on the environment, with second-hand smoke from cars contributing to air pollution.

The new law will be enforced by the police, who will have the power to issue fixed penalty notices to drivers who break the ban. Drivers who fail to pay the fine will face further legal action.

The government has also launched a public awareness campaign to inform drivers about the new law and the consequences of breaking it. The campaign includes posters, social media ads and radio ads, and will run until the end of March.

The ban on smoking in cars with children is part of a wider strategy to reduce the number of smokers in England and promote a healthier lifestyle. It follows similar bans in other countries, including Australia, Canada and parts of the United States.

In conclusion, the ban on smoking in cars with children is a significant step forward in protecting the health of future generations. It is hoped that the ban will encourage more people to quit smoking and create a smoke-free environment for everyone."

We are going to look at one major question: is it lawful?This is a Reality Check you won’t see anywhere else.“Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.”That’s a statement from Trump explaining his plan to prevent terror attacks on U.S. soil—ban all Muslims from entering the country. This plan has been met with a lot of support from some, and condemned by others.“Do you know how to make America great again? Tell Donald Trump to go to hell,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told CNN.“We do not discriminate on people based on religion…,” Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson","---

Breaking News: The controversial statement made by Donald Trump regarding a potential ban on Muslims entering the United States has sparked intense debate and concern among the international community. Trump's proposal has been met with widespread condemnation from various political leaders, civil rights activists, and religious organizations who argue that such a ban would violate fundamental human rights and discriminate against Muslims based on their faith.

The proposal has also been criticized for its potential to fuel hatred and division, as well as its lack of practicality and effectiveness in addressing the issue of terrorism. Many have argued that such a ban would only serve to create more problems than it would solve, by alienating the Muslim community and driving extremists further underground.

Despite the backlash, Trump has remained steadfast in his position, arguing that the ban is necessary to protect national security and prevent future terrorist attacks. However, many have pointed out that such a ban would be unconstitutional and would violate the principles of freedom and equality enshrined in the United States Constitution.

As the debate continues to rage on, many are left wondering whether such a ban would ever be implemented and what the implications would be for both the United States and the international community."

To an extent, the situation speaks for itself.""","WASHINGTON, D.C. — An aide for Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., was arrested over the weekend for attempting to flee the country and has since been charged with bank fraud, according to law enforcement officials.

Imran Awan, a former IT aide for Wasserman Schultz, was taken into custody at Dulles International Airport in Virginia as he attempted to fly to Qatar. He has since been charged with multiple counts of bank fraud, including wire fraud and theft of government funds, in addition to making false statements on loan applications.

The charges against Awan stem from his alleged involvement in a scheme to defraud the Congressional Federal Credit Union, where he was employed as a manager. According to the criminal complaint, Awan and his wife, Hina Alvi, were accused of using their positions to obtain millions of dollars in loans using fake documents and then transferring the funds to individuals in Pakistan.

The arrest of Awan has raised concerns about the security of sensitive information that was in his possession, as he had access to the emails and files of multiple members of Congress. Awan had been working for Wasserman Schultz since 2011 and had access to the House of Representatives' computer network.

In a statement, Wasserman Schultz said she was ""shocked and concerned"" about the charges against Awan and has called for an internal investigation to determine if any sensitive information was compromised. The Florida Democrat also said she has terminated Awan's employment and has called for a review of the security procedures of the House of Representatives' network.

The arrest of Awan marks the latest development in an ongoing investigation into the IT staff of multiple House Democrats, who have been accused of violating House rules and potentially compromising sensitive information. The case has raised concerns about the security of sensitive information and the need for greater oversight of congressional IT staff.

Awan is set to appear in court later this week to face the charges against him."

We want to make an important clarification on claims that were made by Rod Wheeler, the private investigator hired by Seth Rich's family, whose services are being paid for by a third party.What he told FOX 5 DC on camera Monday regarding Seth Rich's murder investigation is in clear contrast to what he has said over the last 48 hours. Rod Wheeler has since backtracked.In an interview Monday, Wheeler told FOX 5 DC he had sources at the FBI confirming there was evidence of communication between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks. This is the verbatim of that exchange:FOX 5 DC: “You have sources at the FBI saying that there is information...”WHEELER: ""For sure...""FOX 5 DC: “...that could link Seth Rich to WikiLeaks?""WHEELER: ""Absolutely.

There have been no solid answers about why he was killed until now.Rich was shot and killed last July in Northwest D.C and police have suggested the killing in the District's Bloomingdale neighborhood was a botched robbery. However, online conspiracy theories have tied the murder to Rich's work at the DNC.Just two months shy of the one-year anniversary of Rich's death, FOX 5 has learned there is new information that could prove these theorists right.Rod Wheeler, a private investigator hired by the Rich family, suggests there is tangible evidence on Rich's laptop that confirms he was communicating with WikiLeaks prior to his death. Wheeler's services were offered to the family and paid for by a third party, according to a statement issued by the Rich family Tuesday which also includes that ""the private investigator who spoke to press was offered to the Rich family and paid for by a third party, and contractually was barred from speaking to press or anyone outside of law enforcement or the family unless explicitly authorized by the family.""Now, questions have been raised on why D.C. police, the lead agency on this murder investigation for the past ten months, have insisted this was a robbery gone bad when there appears to be no evidence to suggest that.Wheeler, a former D.C. police homicide detective, is running a parallel investigation into Rich’s murder. He said he believes there is a cover-up and the police department has been told to back down from the investigation.""The police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming,” said Wheeler. “They haven't been cooperating at all. I believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer, which I believe is either at the police department or either at the FBI. I have been told both.”When we asked Wheeler if his sources have told him there is information that links Rich to Wikileaks, he said, “Absolutely. Yeah. That's confirmed.""Wheeler also told us, ""I have a source inside the police departm","We are continuing to investigate the death of Seth Rich, the former DNC staffer who was murdered in 2016.

Seth Rich, a 27-year-old employee of the Democratic National Committee, was shot and killed in Washington, D.C. on July 10, 2016.

The Metropolitan Police Department, which investigated the crime, determined that Rich was killed in a botched robbery attempt. However, this explanation has been met with skepticism by many, who believe that Rich was assassinated because of his work at the DNC.

These conspiracy theories have been fueled by unverified reports that Rich had contact with Wikileaks before his death.

FOX 5 DC has been investigating the case for over a year, and has learned that Rich had contact with Wikileaks before his death.

The FOX 5 DC investigation found that Rich made contact with Wikileaks through a intermediary before his death. The intermediary has told FOX 5 DC that they spoke to Rich about a leak of DNC emails.

The intermediary has asked to remain anonymous, citing concerns for their safety.

The FBI and MPD have refused to comment on the FOX 5 DC investigation.

However, sources close to the investigation tell FOX 5 DC that the FBI has found evidence that supports the theory that Rich was assassinated.

The sources say that the FBI has found evidence that Rich was in contact with Wikileaks before his death, and that he may have been killed for it.

The sources also say that the FBI has found evidence that Rich's death was not a random robbery, but was instead a premeditated murder.

The sources say that the FBI has found evidence that Rich was killed by a hired hitman.

The sources also say that the FBI has found evidence that the hitman was paid by a high-ranking Democratic official.

The sources did not identify the official, but said that the person is well-known and has a significant political following.

The sources also say that the FBI has found evidence that the murder was covered up by the DNC and the Clinton campaign.

The sources say that the DNC and the Clinton campaign were concerned that the murder would harm their chances in the 2016 election.

FOX 5 DC has not been able to independently confirm the sources' claims.

However, the sources have provided specific details that match information that has been previously reported.

FOX 5 DC will continue to investigate the case and will provide updates as more information becomes available."

politifact14148,1,0,"We all get lazy from time to time and just want to quit everything, crawl back to bed under a layer of blankets and live there until we feel better. We might feel a bit guilty but a relaxing day in bed sounds awesome. Even though it’s a luxury which few of us can afford, at least we can all fantasize about it.If you’re one of those who are in desperate need of some peace and relaxation, NASA might offer you the perfect opportunity to do so and get payed on top of it. But it may involve a bit more relaxation than you’re prepared for.NASA has put out an ad looking for people who’re willing to take part in their “Rest Studies” – a study which will require participant to spend 70 straight days in bed, relaxing and smoking different types of cannabis, for which they will receive a salary of 18.000 USD. During the relaxation period participants are allowed to read books, play games, Skype and smoke weed. They can do whatever they want as long as it involves staying in bed, week after week, earning a cool 1200 USD per week.So what is the exact purpose of these studies?These studies have the purpose of figuring out the best way to preserve astronauts’ health and safety during periods of prolonged space travel. Complete rest and relaxation is the best way to stimulate zero gravity in space because zero gravity actually means zero weight or strain on your muscle. Additionally, they wanted to see how marijuana will affect the body in such an environment.The Rest Study is a very convenient way to examine the changes our body endures during space travel.This study is designed to achieve three core tasks:Examining how the astronauts’ changing physiology in space could affect the process of certain missions.Examining if the astronauts’ physiological state could affect their ability to perform in particular tasks.Preparing countermeasures to combat any impairment that these physiological conditions may impose.The study’s participants were divided into two groups: exercising and non-exercising.The exercising group will have to exercise (on a specially designed equipment to maintain the laying down position and smoke cannabis), while the non-exercising group will just have to lie down and relax completely.The entire study will last somewhere between 97 and 105, depending on whether you’re in the exercising or non-exercising group.Once the study begins, during the initial 13 days (non-exercising subjects) and 21 days (exercising subjects) you can move around the bed rest area freely, in and out of bed. But once this period ends, for the next 70 days you’ll be forbidden from leaving your bed. For 70 days you’ll have to lie down, with your feet up, kick back and enjoy! You’ll get out of bed only for a few tests and nothing more. 70 days of complete lazing.During the study, NASA will have to conduct bone, muscle and heart tests, as well as tests of your circulatory and nervous systems, your nutritional condition, and your body’s immunity system.But is it worth it?You may not think so at first, but spending two whole months in bed can be really excruciating. At some point you may feel like you can’t take it anymore but at least you can rest assured that your efforts will help in the advancement of human space travel.This will probably be your only opportunity to say that you’ve actually helped send the first astronauts to Mars by just being your lazy self and doing nothing in particular but lying flat on your back.Source:http://mysteriousearth.net","Breaking News: A recent study has revealed that feeling lazy and wanting to quit everything is a common human experience. According to the study, many individuals experience a sense of apathy and hopelessness at some point in their lives, leading to a desire to retreat from the world.

The study, conducted by a team of psychologists, surveyed over 1000 individuals across different age groups and socioeconomic backgrounds. The results showed that over 80% of the participants had experienced feelings of laziness and a desire to give up on their responsibilities and obligations at least once in their lives.

Furthermore, the study also found that this feeling of laziness is not limited to any particular age group or gender. It can affect anyone, regardless of their background or circumstances.

The study's findings have important implications for mental health professionals, as they highlight the need for early intervention and support for individuals who are struggling with feelings of laziness and apathy. By recognizing and addressing these feelings in a timely manner, individuals can avoid falling into a cycle of negativity and despair.

In conclusion, it is important to remember that feeling lazy and wanting to quit everything is a common human experience. However, it is also essential to seek help and support when needed, in order to maintain a healthy mental state and avoid falling into a cycle of negativity and despair."

Burt Lancaster announced a few hours later that the team will be seeking a new forward to replace Brown.“We wish Mr. Brown the best, but we feel that he does not embody the values of the Tampa Bay Lightning,” Lancaster says. “We support our country, we support our troops, we support our police, and we support our President.”Brown will continue to be paid until the end of the season as per the terms of his contract, but will then be looking for a job.","The National Football League (NFL) has been embroiled in controversy over the past few years due to the actions of a number of its players who have chosen to kneel during the national anthem as a form of protest against police brutality and racial injustice. While the league has been criticized for its handling of the situation, it has also been praised for its efforts to support and advocate for its black players.

However, not all professional sports leagues have followed the NFL's lead in this regard. In fact, the National Hockey League (NHL) has taken a much different approach to the issue of protests during the national anthem. Instead of supporting its players who choose to kneel, the NHL has made it clear that any form of protest during the anthem will not be tolerated.

Some have criticized the NHL for its stance, arguing that it is ignoring the important issues that its players are trying to bring attention to. Others, however, have praised the league for its commitment to tradition and respect for the national anthem and flag.

Regardless of one's personal stance on the issue, it is clear that the NHL's approach is vastly different from that of the NFL. While the NFL may be coddling black athletes who choose to kneel, the NHL refuses to do the same, choosing instead to maintain a strict policy of adherence to tradition and respect for the national anthem and flag."

The day of the wedding, thousands of Britons took the day off, and about 1,900 guests attended the ceremony in Westminster Abbey in central London. The Obamas traveled to the U.K. less than a month later for an official state visit. Since Obama is no longer president, he doesn’t require as extensive a security detail as he once did.If Trump were to appear at Prince Harry’s wedding in spring 2018, it would likely spark protests. When Prime Minister Theresa May offered Trump a state visit early this year, polls showed that 2 million people intended to take part in a protest against him. The risk of embarrassment, were such a protest to occur at a royal wedding, might put the couple off inviting such a controversial figure.Instead of a state visit, Trump’s trip to the U.K., scheduled for early 2018, has been cast as a “working trip” where he will not meet the queen. In January, sources said Trump wanted to go “one better” than Obama’s state visit and play golf with Queen Elizabeth II at Balmoral Castle.Keep up with this story and more by subscribing nowRead more: Melania Trump “went bananas” when Ivana Trump called herself 'first lady'The Obamas have forged a close relationship with Prince Harry. Former first lady Michelle Obama appeared with the 33-year-old royal for charity events in Chicago at the end of October. The former president was overheard quizzing Harry on his relationship with Markle, an American actor, when he sat with the prince at the Invictus Games, a sports event for injured servicemen and women founded by the prince, at the end of September in Toronto. Prince Harry also hosted Obama at Kensington Palace in May.As for President Trump, Harry's wife-to-be revealed that she was not a fan. In an interview on The Nightly Show With Larry Wilmore during the 2016 election, Markle said she might decide to stay in Toronto—where her show, Suits, is filmed—if Trump were to win.“We film Suits in Toronto, and I might just stay in Canada. I mean, come on, if that's reality we are talking about, come on, that is a game changer in terms of how we move in the world here,” she said.Markle supported Democrat Hillary Clinton during the election, calling Trump “misogynistic.”Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other Commonwealth leaders are expected to receive invitations to the wedding because of their nations' ties to the British Empire.","According to sources close to the matter, President Donald Trump has been extended an invitation to the highly anticipated royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. However, the guest list for the event has not yet been finalized, and a number of factors could prevent Trump from receiving an invitation.

Sources indicate that the royal family may be hesitant to invite Trump due to his controversial policies and divisive rhetoric, which have been widely criticized both in the UK and abroad. Additionally, Trump's past comments about the royal family, including his criticism of Prince Charles' environmental activism, could also be a factor in the decision not to extend an invitation.

Despite the uncertainty surrounding his potential attendance, Trump has expressed his interest in attending the wedding, stating that he would ""love to go."" However, it remains to be seen whether the royal family will extend an invitation to the US president, given the potential diplomatic fallout and controversy it could generate."
politifact15545,1,0,"8.9k SHARES SHARE THIS STORYPresident Trump made a barely veiled threat today on Twitter to Representative Maxine Waters (D-CA) after the congresswoman called for the continued public shaming of members of his administration to hold them accountable for the president’s heinous policies, particularly the immigration policy debacle that led to the separation of thousands of children from their refugee parents at the border.Congresswoman Maxine Waters, an extraordinarily low IQ person, has become, together with Nancy Pelosi, the Face of the Democrat Party. She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 25, 2018Trump, of course, lied about what Rep. Waters called for which was peaceful protests and public demonstrations rather than the “harm” he claims. The “Be careful what you wish for Max!” quote, however, was a dog whistle call to action for his supporters to attack Rep. Waters on par with his warning during his campaign when discussing Hillary Clinton that perhaps “the Second Amendment people” i.e., gun owners could solve the problem.While some people may consider Trump’s tweet as more cheap theatrics for his base, the president’s hate-mongering towards Waters has real-life consequences as the news today about a San Pedro, California man demonstrates.Anthony Scott Lloyd, 45, is expected to plead guilty today to a charge of threatening to kill Rep. Maxine Waters because of her criticism of President Trump.According to the Los Angeles Times, Lloyd “faces a single count of threatening a United States official, according to a plea agreement filed March 26. It is punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.”Lloyd’s plea details the voicemail that he left at Congresswoman Waters’ Washington DC office last October that used both a racial slur and an anti-gay epithet to refer to the representative and stated that:“If you continue to make threats towards the president, you’re going to wind up dead, Maxine, ’cause we’ll kill you.“The voicemail was forwarded to the FBI who investigated it and arrested Lloyd who claims that the call was a “spur of the moment” decision made while listening to conservative talk radio and that he had no real intention of following through with the threat.Unfortunately, we have no such assurances from the president himself, and given Trump’s penchant for simply ignoring the rule of law, that is a frightening proposition.The contrast here is stark between Trump and Waters and the other Democrats whose calls for peaceful activism through public declarations of disgust and shaming of deplorable policies and behaviors are met by Trump and his Republican enablers with threats laden with hints of violence.When those threats lead deranged Trump supporters to take action beyond mere threatening phone calls, the responsibility for incitement to violence will be squarely at Trump’s feet.Add your name to millions demanding Congress take action on the President’s crimes. IMPEACH TRUMP & PENCE!","“I’m not a fan of Maxine Waters,” Trump tweeted. “She’s a low IQ individual who has been a disaster for her constituents. Her rants and raves are a total waste of time and she’s only got a following of screaming radicals who refuse to listen to any reason or common sense. Maxine should spend more time focusing on the real problems of her district, like the horrible gang violence and high crime rates that plague her constituents, rather than always trying to stir up trouble and division for the sake of getting attention. Sad!”

Waters, a vocal critic of the president, fired back with a statement condemning his remarks.
“I will not be intimidated by any of his tweets or attacks,” she said. “My commitment to speaking out against his dangerous and unethical policies remains steadfast, and I will continue to fight for the people of my district and this country.”"

When she got near to kiss him, she felt he had a fever. She imagined it was just a common cold and thought about a home remedy to relieve him.She rubbed Vick VapoRub on his chest, back, and under his nose to help him breathe. She tucked him up and laid down next to him.She was tired, so she fell asleep next to her baby. Hours later, when she woke up, she noticed her son wasn’t breathing.She carried him and took it to the hospital to save him. But, sadly, everything was pointless, the baby had been dead for hours.The medical report stated the child died due to inflammation in the respiratory track, produced by the camphor contained in the famous ointment.She never imagined that home remedy would take his baby. She only wanted to help him breathe, and the ointment did exactly the opposite.The thing is, this remedy is effective for adults; however, for babies younger than two years old, the ointment increases the mucus by 60%. The mucus accumulates on the trachea and blocks the breathing.The label warns the ointment is contraindicated for children younger than 3 years old.Sadly, in the case of the Mexican mother, the warning went unnoticed. Using home remedies for several affections is something common in homes around the world, but we hope this story draw attention to this fact: when children are concerned, we must always read the labels and ask for the advice of experts before using any home remedy.We must not let a simple mistake take our loved ones; we must be careful and seek medical advice to treat any illness.","It might be hard to believe, after all, many of us had used Vick VapoRub. It seems like a harmless ointment, effective for fever, nasal congestion, and many other affections. However, recent studies have revealed that Vick VapoRub contains turpentine, a substance known to be toxic if inhaled or ingested. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a warning regarding the use of Vick VapoRub in children under two years old, as it can cause serious health complications.

In a recent report published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), turpentine was found to be toxic to the liver, kidneys, and other organs. Long-term use of Vick VapoRub can lead to organ damage, and in some cases, even death. The FDA has received numerous reports of adverse effects associated with the use of Vick VapoRub, including nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and respiratory problems.

Experts advise caution when using Vick VapoRub, especially in children and pregnant women. They recommend consulting a healthcare professional before using any new medication or ointment, including Vick VapoRub. Parents should also be aware of the potential dangers of using Vick VapoRub on their children, and avoid using it as a remedy for common ailments such as cough or cold.

In conclusion, Vick VapoRub may seem like a harmless ointment, but recent studies have revealed its potential dangers. It is essential to be cautious when using Vick VapoRub, and to consult a healthcare professional before using it. Parents should also avoid using Vick VapoRub on their children, and opt for safer alternatives to treat common ailments."

The tragic incident has sent shockwaves through the community, raising questions about the emotional toll of the presidential election on Americans.

Political analysts have noted that the election has been particularly divisive, with many citizens expressing feelings of fear, anger, and disillusionment. Some have suggested that the highly charged rhetoric of the campaign may have contributed to a climate of hopelessness and despair.

The Michigan elector's death is the latest in a string of incidents that have occurred in the wake of the election. In recent weeks, there have been reports of hate crimes, protests, and even violence in some areas of the country.

On paper, the land was owned by the allegedly defunct Solyndra Corporation, a startup solar company to which Obama gave 2.2 billion taxpayer dollars in 2009. Shortly thereafter, Solyndra declared bankruptcy, and the money vanished. Despite apparent poverty, Solyndra maintained real estate holdings valued at over 800 million dollars in a half-dozen Southeast Asian countries. The Trump administration connected the dots, linking Obama to the Thai property, after asserting Presidential privilege and subpoenaing flight records that demonstrably proved Obama had travelled to Si Sa Ket six times as president and an additional four times in the past year.In a June 2009 edition of the Washington Beacon, conservative author Thomas Clearwater wrote, “Solyndra does not appear to be a legitimate institution, and is likely a shell company or slush fund used or owned by Obama to launder his dirty money.”Our Secret Service source supports that contention.“Obama holds real estate, vast sums of currency, and shadow companies across the globe, under many aliases. He doesn’t keep them in his name, as that would be too conspicuous. The administration has learned about many of them and has been working with foreign governments to seize Obama’s illicitly gained assets. Many of these nations are not exactly friendly to the United States; we don’t know what Trump offered in exchange for rights to seize assets in non-extradition countries or put special operations boots on the ground on foreign soil. I’m sure the price way high. Clandestine missions are occurring right now. The Solyndra mansion was just one of many,” our source explained.At 3:00 am (local time), a pair of helicopters, including decoy craft, airlifted Delta to its destination. They found the mansion deserted; however, according to our source, the dwelling had been recently occupied. The unit commander discovered freshly chopped vegetables and lukewarm coffee in the kitchen; outside fresh tire impressions lead away from the compound. Someone, our source said, must have tipped off the occupants shortly before Delta arrived on scene.Still, Delta did not leave the location empty-handed. They seized several encrypted laptops and over 200 million dollars in gold bullion, in addition to dozens of crates containing Chinese manufactured firearms and explosives. Moreover, and perhaps most disturbing, a maze of underground tunnels, ostensibly used for human trafficking, ran for miles in every direction beneath the surface.

One can see why: He liked to beat and starve women himself. Maybe he saw Raniere as a potential partner-in-crime…Watch more below and click in the link!!!Full TextLike this: Like Loading...","---

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has been accused of using his position to cover up the criminal activities of NXIVM, a cult-like organization that has been recently exposed for trafficking child sex slaves to the Clintons. The accusation comes as a shock to many, as Schneiderman had previously been known for his vocal opposition to sex trafficking.

The allegations were first made by several women who were former members of NXIVM, a group that was founded by Keith Raniere. The women claim that Schneiderman not only knew about the criminal activities of NXIVM but also actively helped to cover them up. They further claim that the Attorney General had a personal relationship with Raniere and that he was compromised by it.

The allegations against Schneiderman are extremely serious and if proven true, would constitute a betrayal of the public trust. The Attorney General is responsible for upholding the law and protecting the citizens of New York, and it is his duty to ensure that justice is served. The fact that Schneiderman may have used his position to protect a criminal organization that was involved in the trafficking of children is deeply troubling and raises serious questions about his fitness to hold public office.

It is important to note that these allegations are still under investigation, and Schneiderman has vehemently denied any wrongdoing. However, if the allegations are proven to be true, it would be a major scandal that would shake the foundations of the New York political establishment. The public deserves to know the truth, and it is up to the authorities to ensure that a full and impartial investigation is conducted."

The photo has sparked a flurry of speculation about how the shark ended up in the street. Some have suggested that it may have been washed up on shore, while others have speculated that it could have been released into the water by its owner.

The photo has also raised concerns about the safety of the residents in the area. While sharks are typically not considered a threat to humans on land, the presence of a shark in a street could potentially pose a danger to anyone who comes into contact with it. Local authorities have yet to comment on the situation, but it is likely that they will take steps to ensure the safety of the residents.

Law enforcement officials have identified the gunman who opened fire inside a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, as Devin Kelley, an Antifa member who vowed to start a civil war by ""targeting white conservative churches"" and causing anarchy in the United States.

According to sources close to the investigation, Kelley entered the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs during a Sunday service and began shooting indiscriminately, killing 26 people and injuring several others. The massacre has left the small Texas community in shock and grief, with many asking how such a horrific event could happen in their midst.

The motive behind the shooting remains unclear, but law enforcement officials have revealed that Kelley had a history of domestic violence and had been dishonorably discharged from the Air Force for assaulting his wife and child. The discovery of a ""day planner"" in Kelley's vehicle that contained information about the church and its congregation has led authorities to believe that the attack was planned in advance.

Antifa, a loosely organized group of left-wing activists, has distanced itself from Kelley's actions, condemning the shooting and denying any affiliation with the suspect. However, the revelation of Kelley's Antifa ties has raised concerns about the potential for violence from extremist groups on both the left and the right.

The FBI and other federal agencies are reportedly investigating Kelley's links to Antifa and other extremist groups, as well as his motive for the shooting. In the meantime, the people of Sutherland Springs are grappling with the aftermath of the tragedy, seeking solace and healing in the face of unimaginable loss."

This comes just hours after a man was dragged off of an overbooked United Airlines flight when he refused to get off the plane. He was pulled out of his seat and thrown into the aisle as seen on a video released on Monday.The baby, whose name has not been released, was left with a welt mark across his face due to the assault. Eyewitnesses say the little boy was screaming for about 38 minutes straight and the parents were asked by the flight attendant several times to “quiet that annoying ass baby down.”After the 4th attempt to get the parents to comply, the flight attendant erupted into a rage grabbing the baby from the mother’s arms and slapping him in the face. It took several passengers to subdue the United Airlines employee.The flight attendant was restrained in the back of the plane until the Pilot could make an emergency landing in Missouri. United Airlines released a statement saying the employee acted in a way that does not represent their company and has been fired.The little boy is said to be in stable condition with no life-threatening injuries. The parents say they are reaching out to an attorney, refusing to give any further statements.","A shocking incident occurred during a flight from New York City to Chicago on Wednesday. According to eyewitnesses, a flight attendant assaulted a 7 month-old baby boy, causing a violent outburst among passengers.

The incident took place during the flight's journey, when the flight attendant allegedly became agitated after the baby began crying. The attendant reportedly grabbed the infant by the arm and shook him violently, causing him to sustain injuries.

Passengers on the flight were left stunned by the sudden outburst of violence, and many were left visibly shaken by the incident. Many passengers attempted to intervene and stop the attack, but were unable to do so.

The baby's parents, who were seated nearby, were horrified by the incident and immediately sought medical attention for their child upon landing. The flight attendant involved in the incident has been taken into custody by authorities and is facing charges of assault.

The incident has sparked outrage among the public, with many calling for stricter regulations on airline staff and improved training on how to handle situations involving unruly passengers.

The airline involved in the incident has issued a statement expressing their condolences to the baby and his family and pledging to fully cooperate with authorities in their investigation. They have also stated that they are taking steps to ensure that such an incident does not occur again in the future.

The incident is a stark reminder of the importance of airline staff maintaining their composure and treating all passengers with respect and dignity, regardless of their age or behavior."
politifact13687,1,0,"The Republican war on women continues unabated. The same week that conservatives argued in the Supreme Court that employers should be able to stop their employees from getting contraception outside of the company health plan, Indiana joined the ranks of states like Texas and Florida in passing a draconian law that purports to protect women, while in fact, endangering their health by making safe abortion much harder to get. And Gov. Mike Pence recently signed it. The bill is stuffed with as many asinine restrictions on abortion with an eye towards making abortion as miserable and humiliating an experience as possible, and ideally something women can’t get legally at all.Asked to comment on his approval of a piece of legislation that basically promotes hatred towards women once stripped of all the legal terms, Pence argued in an interview with The Huffington Post that “abortion as such was a mistake since the day it was first invented.” “So, let’s get that straight right away – I oppose abortion for any reason whatsoever because I believe that killing someone, or something, if you will, that hasn’t developed a consciousness just yet is the ultimate act of crime. And if we’re murderers of innocent beings who can’t defend themselves, how are we to expect people with a fully developed consciousness to stop murdering each other?” the Indiana governor said.“And as if that wasn’t enough,” Pence continued, “we’ve got this situation now throughout different states where some lawmakers allow abortion under some circumstances like rape or when the fetus is diagnosed with an illness, and others just flat out prohibit it. And that’s bad for a number of reasons. First and foremost – we can’t have this kind of freedom of choice. This is bad, let’s be clear. And that’s part of the reason why I signed this bill, because I believe abortion, or I’m going to flat out call it murder, this murdering of children has to stop and it has to be prohibited in every state. So Indiana is just a step in the right direction.”Pence also tried to offer his opinion on what would have happened had he allowed rape victims to still have abortion. “First and foremost, because this is such a sensitive topic, let me just say that I sympathize with rape victims not just in America, but around the world. I can only imagine what it must be like to experience such trauma,” he said. “However, that does not justify murder, not even that justifies murdering a baby, not in my book. Because what would happen? We’d then have an epidemic of women claiming to have been raped just so they could have an abortion. And that has to be stopped at all cost.”Donald Trump’s new running mate also said, “Basically, if I’d have said no on the bill, that would be just like giving out get-pregnant-without-fear cards, because at the end of the day, women could have unprotected sex without worrying about what they’d do in the event of pregnancy. And you know, it’s not supposed to be like that. That would be equal to me picking up a butcher’s knife and slicing people open in the middle of the street. That would be murder. And I’m not a murderer.”“And it gets worse – when you get an abortion, you get several days off of work and whatnot to recover. And there are a lot of crazy people out there. What if women would go out and get raped on purpose just so they could get off work? I mean, Indiana’s economy is struggling as it is, and having thousands of women absent from their jobs would be horrific for the state, I’m telling you. I made the right call and that will be confirmed in the long run,” Pence concluded.","According to the Guttmacher Institute, a leading research and policy organization that supports access to abortion, the new law will effectively close all but one of Indiana's abortion clinics. The law requires abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital, which is a medical necessity, but also a nearly impossible standard to meet. In addition, the law mandates that abortions be performed at ambulatory surgical centers, which are much more expensive to build and maintain than abortion clinics.

Furthermore, the law will have a disproportionate impact on low-income women, who may not be able to afford the increased costs associated with the new regulations. The law also imposes strict regulations on the use of medication abortion, which has been shown to be a safe and effective method of terminating a pregnancy.

The Republican war on women continues unabated, as conservatives in Indiana and across the country pass laws that restrict access to reproductive health care, including contraception and abortion. These laws are not based on science or medical evidence, but on ideological beliefs that seek to control women's bodies and limit their reproductive rights. Women's health and safety are being put at risk in the name of political gain, and it is time for our leaders to take action to protect the rights of all women."

Washington, D.C. - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a warning to the public about the dangers of mixing alcohol and marijuana, especially when using a scuba tank to smoke weed. In a statement released earlier today, the agency highlighted the risks of combining these two substances and emphasized that such behavior can lead to serious health consequences, including death.

According to the FDA, drinking and drugging will teach you lots of lessons, one of which includes not smoking weed through a scuba tank after consuming copious amounts of alcohol. The agency warned that such actions can lead to a lack of oxygen, which can cause the user to pass out and potentially drown. Additionally, the FDA noted that smoking marijuana through a scuba tank can lead to a buildup of carbon dioxide in the tank, which can also be dangerous for the user.

The FDA also cautioned that using a scuba tank to smoke weed is illegal and can result in criminal charges. The agency emphasized that marijuana is still illegal under federal law, and using it in any form can lead to serious consequences.

In light of these warnings, the FDA is urging the public to exercise caution when consuming alcohol and marijuana and to avoid using a scuba tank to smoke weed. The agency also encouraged anyone who has experienced negative effects from combining these substances to seek medical attention immediately.

""We want to remind the public that drinking and drugging will teach you lots of lessons, one of which includes not smoking weed through a scuba tank after drinking copious amounts of alcohol,"" said the FDA in its statement. ""The risks associated with this behavior are serious, and we urge everyone to be cautious and responsible when it comes to their health and well-being."""

politifact13560,1,0,"The announcement that Mall of America was welcoming its first black Santa Claus was greeted in many quarters as a good thing but, as might be expected in a country that has become increasingly more comfortable saying any racist thing that comes to mind, many were highly offended. Three years after Fox’s Megyn Kelly definitively explained to America that both Jesus Christ and Santa Claus were white men, Mall of America dismissed her advice and hired Larry Jefferson, a retired U.S. Army veteran from Irving, Texas to spend four days at the mall listening to the wish lists of children of all colors.Among many who were offended by this move was former half-term governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin. The sharp-tongued Republican wasted no time in condemning the company’s actions, going on social media and posting comments that called for boycotting and “running Mall of America into the ground,” on the basis of Santa “always having been white in the Bible.” “No, I refuse to believe that they went this far in trying to cater to the minorities, I thought the company had some backbone but I guess I was wrong,” Palin told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune.She also argued that hiring a non-white Santa Claus was “the last straw” in corporate America’s twisting of traditional, conservative Christian values, “because they realized they couldn’t make any more money off of the usual scams and techniques they’ve been using so far.” She added, “That’s why they had to come up with something new and out of the box, at least something that appeared that way in their minds. But, this proves that they have no morals and that they won’t shy away from even the most blatant twisting of traditional Christian values, just so they could make more money. I understand having to make a profit in order to get by and have a good life, but I don’t understand stomping on things that are holy and sacred in order to accomplish that.”“That’s why Americans, especially white ones, need to boycott the company and need to run it into the ground, so that they never ever come up with such an offensive and sacrilegious idea again,” Palin added. “The Holy Book always said Santa Claus was white and any kind of deviation from that, regardless of its magnitude, is a sin. And we need to make an example out of Mall of America. If we don’t, if we let them get away with it, what’s next? Others will follow their example and the next thing we know, we’re going to be having Arab Santa Clauses that are going to be teaching our kids how to make IEDs out of Christmas lights. I mean, just look at the number of white youngsters infatuated with rap and hip-hop music; you think that’s happening by accident?”“Nope, our children are systematically being indoctrinated into other cultures and interests that have nothing to do with traditional, white Christianity. The numbers of converts to Islam have also spiked, just as much as interracial marriages between white women and members of other ethnic groups. We are being bred out, people, and as innocent as it may seem, a black Santa is just the beginning,” she concluded.","---

In a move that has been hailed as a step forward for racial diversity, the Mall of America has announced that it will be welcoming its first black Santa Claus. However, the news has not been universally well-received, with many taking offense to the decision.

The backlash against the decision to hire a black Santa has been swift and intense, with many critics accusing the Mall of promoting ""political correctness"" and ""reverse racism."" Despite these criticisms, the Mall has stood by its decision, stating that it is committed to representing the diversity of its customer base.

The hiring of a black Santa Claus is just the latest example of the increasingly polarized nature of race relations in the United States. While many see the move as a positive step forward, others are quick to take offense at any perceived slight, no matter how small.

It remains to be seen how this latest controversy will play out, but one thing is clear: the issue of race continues to be a deeply divisive and sensitive topic in American society."

We need a great match. Not another rigged result that doesn’t pass the sniff test.“I like money as much as the next guy. But I like football more. I can’t stand by and allow rampant greed and cynicism to destroy the game I love. The little boy in me won’t allow it.“Football in America won’t recover from this.”Early reports stating Goodes had been shot dead in an “gangland-style execution” in New York City have also been scrubbed from the internet, but not before alert readers captured screenshots of the story.According to Goodes, the NFL have organized a “rigged game” that will earn “maximum revenue” for the league, and hundreds of millions for broadcasters and advertisers, but will leave increasingly jaded Americans with a bad taste in their mouth.“This is the biggest scam in sports history,” Goodes said in Minneapolis, according to reports. “The Super Bowl is already completely scripted out.”“How do I know it’s scripted? I’ve read the damn thing.““You need to understand the NFL is a $35 billion shared revenue corporation. Outcomes can’t be left to chance. Total league revenues are shared equally by all franchises, so they don’t care who wins or loses. Let me be perfectly clear here. It doesn’t matter to the franchise owners. It doesn’t matter to the players. But it matters to the league. Outcomes have been fixed to maximize profits ever since my early days here.”“The sad thing is that it’s legal. Can you believe that? It’s legal thanks to guys [entertainment laywers] like me.”Explaining that the NFL is officially registered as “entertainment,” Goodes said “The NFL has more in common with WWE than you could possibly imagine.”The NFL possesses an Anti-Trust Exemption to the law granted to it by President John F. Kennedy, which ultimately allows the NFL to classify itself as “entertainment” rather than sport, as well as incorporate itself as a single entity, instead of the 32 separate “franchises” they would want you to believe.In a 2004 lawsuit, the NFL argued they are not a collection of 32 teams in competition with each other. They argued they are a single entity, providing “entertainment” in the marketplace, and as such they are not subject to Anti-Trust laws.The only other “sport” that occupies this legal position is the WWE.How are games rigged?According to Goodes, the fat cat franchise owners and their pampered players do not care who wins, as long as they continue reaping the lucrative financial benefits provided by the system.“Have you ever stopped to wonder how Vegas makes the point spread line and over under so close every week? There is not one game where the result totally blows away the point spread or the over under. It doesn’t happen. Are they that good? Hell, no they’re not.

The police have not yet determined the cause of death, but sources close to the investigation say that there were no signs of foul play.

The lawyer’s shocking statement has sent shockwaves through the football world, and many fans are questioning the integrity of the game. The NFL has issued a statement denying the allegations and calling the lawyer’s comments “baseless and unfounded.” The league has also expressed its condolences to the lawyer’s family and friends, but has not commented further on the matter.

A short list of Francis’s most controversial statements include:PREACHING THAT ‘JESUS TURNED INTO SATAN’Pope Francis went where no other Christian, let alone Pope, had ever gone before, accusing Jesus of “debasing himself up to the point of totally annihilating himself”, and “turning into Satan.”Hardcore Francis apologists claim the quote was taken out of context, but when the passage is read in it’s entirety it is clear that Francis meant exactly what he said.Making matters worse, Pope Francis later doubled down, spreading Satanic doctrine further, when he said that Jesus Christ “made himself the devil, the serpent, for us,” according to L’Osservatore Romano, the daily newspaper of the Vatican.PREACHING THAT RELATIONSHIPS WITH JESUS ARE ‘HARMFUL’The heretical statement by Pope Francis comes after he broke with centuries of Christian tradition earlier this year, telling a crowd of 33,000 Catholics in Rome that “a personal, direct, immediate relationship with Jesus Christ” must be avoided at all costs.“Having a personal relationship with Jesus is dangerous and very harmful,” the pope said during the June 25 speech.The unconventional teachings of Pope Francis have caused Vatican Cardinals and senior priests to turn their back on the pontiff and refuse to pledge obedience to him.OPENLY CALLING FOR ‘ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT’In July this year Pope Francis told the Italian newspaper La Repubblica that the United States of America has “a distorted vision of the world” and Americans must be ruled by a world government, as soon as possible, “for their own good.”The week before he also called for “a one world government” and “political authority”, arguing that the creation of the one world government is needed to combat major issues such as “climate change.”Speaking with Ecuador’s El Universo newspaper, the Pope said that the United Nations doesnt have enough power and must be granted full governmental control “for the good of humanity.”France’s Marine Le Pen described Pope Francis as a “globalist bulldog“. Vladimir Putin argued that Francis’s unconventional teachings disqualified the Pope from calling himself a man of God. Francis’s own Cardinals are in open revolt against him, telling anybody who will listen that he was installed in unusual circumstances, with the assistance of globalist powerbrokers like George Soros.Pope Francis’s anti-Christian teachings are forcing Christians around the world to confront the difficult question – is he the false prophet that will precede the antichrist foretold in holy scripture?","Pope Francis’s latest controversial statement has pushed the Catholic Church to the verge of open mutiny, with multiple Vatican cardinals going on the record declaring him to be the false prophet foretold in holy scripture and prophecy. The statement, which asserts that “Jesus is metaphorical, not literal”, has sparked widespread outrage among the Catholic faithful and has caused a deep rift within the Church hierarchy.

Cardinal Peter Turkson of Ghana, the President of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace, has accused Pope Francis of leading the Church towards heresy, while Cardinal Robert Sarah of Guinea, the Prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, has publicly called for the Pope’s resignation. Other high-ranking Church officials have also expressed their dissatisfaction with the Pope’s leadership, with some even suggesting that he is a threat to the very foundations of the Catholic faith.

The Vatican has attempted to downplay the situation, issuing a statement that the Pope’s remarks were taken out of context and that he did not mean to suggest that Jesus was not a real historical figure. However, this has only further inflamed tensions within the Church, with many faithful calling for a formal investigation into the Pope’s statements and his fitness to lead the Catholic Church.

The Chinese did, according to well-placed FBI sources.And while Democratic lawmakers and the mainstream media prop up Russia as America’s boogeyman, it was the ironically Chinese who acquired Hillary’s treasure trove of classified and top secret intelligence from her home-brewed private server.And a public revelation of that magnitude — publicizing that a communist world power intercepted Hillary’s sensitive and top secret emails — would have derailed Hillary Clinton’s presidential hopes. Overnight. But it didn’t simply because it was concealed.FBI bosses knew of the breach yet did nothing to investigate, seemingly trying to run out the clock on the alarming revelations to protect Hillary during her heated presidential campaign with Trump. So instead of investigating the hacking of Clinton’s server, FBI bosses sat quietly.And did nothing to confirm the Chinese assets were linked to their government. Or assess the damage such a tremendous breach posed to national security. Did the Chinese government access Hillary’s emails? The FBI didn’t care enough to investigate at the risk of besmirching Clinton and further soiling her during the election.Hundreds of top secret documents and even the president’s daily travel and security itineraries were on that server — and intercepted by a communist country — yet the FBI sat on the evidence. Likewise, all of Clinton’s and her inner circle’s outgoing emails were compromised as well, sources confirmed.Even the Inspector General had tipped off the FBI — specifically Strzok — about the foreign breach. Still, no timely case was pursued.That same cover-up pattern fits FBI bosses who time after time stalled and concealed other criminal intelligence on Clinton in the weeks prior to the election.We could write more detail here and ramble on and on but at this point, we simply ask.Is anyone going to go to prison for politicizing the FBI and covering up countless crimes committed by FBI personnel in a variety of coordinated schemes to protect Hillary and the Democrats?","Lisa Page, a former FBI lawyer who once worked under the leadership of James Comey and Andrew McCabe, has decided to leave the bureau and become the latest in a long line of rats to abandon the sinking ship.

Page, who was involved in the investigation into President Donald Trump's campaign, has reportedly become disillusioned with the FBI and its leadership, and has chosen to depart the agency rather than continue to work under the current conditions.

This news is likely to be a significant blow to the FBI, which has already been rocked by a series of high-profile departures and scandals. The departure of Page, who was once seen as a key player in the bureau's investigation into Trump, is likely to further erode public confidence in the agency and its leadership.

It remains to be seen how the FBI will respond to this latest departure, but it is clear that the agency is facing a crisis of confidence and credibility. As the dust continues to settle from the Mueller investigation and the ongoing controversies surrounding the bureau, it is increasingly clear that the FBI is in need of serious reform and renewal."
politifact11773,1,0,"335 SHARES SHARE THIS STORYRepublican attacks on transgendered Americans and the religious fight to keep gender a binary delineation took a turn for the bizarre this week when Virginia Republican Mark Cole filed a bill that would force schools to check the genitals of their students in order to ensure that they are using facilities reserved for their “anatomical sex:”Local school boards shall develop and implement policies that require every school restroom, locker room, or shower room that is designated for use by a specific gender to solely be used by individuals whose anatomical sex matches such gender designation. Such policies may also provide that a student may, upon request, be granted access, to the extent reasonable, to a single stall restroom or shower, a unisex bathroom, or controlled individual use of a restroom, locker room, or shower. Any student who willfully and knowingly violates this section shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $50. Civil penalties assessed under this section shall be paid into the Literary Fund. Any law-enforcement officer may issue a summons regarding a violation of this section.He did not deign to inform us how this would be accomplished, but it’s hard to imagine any scenario that did not involve adults inspecting the genitals of children before using the bathroom. Notably, it also provides for stigmatizing transgendered children by isolating them in a single person bathroom, which the Department of Justice ruled in June was a violation of the student’s rights. It is a disgusting show of transphobia that has no place in our public schools; the GOP must accept that America is a multi-gendered, multi-ethnic nation, and no amount of perverted laws is going to change that.Download our NEW Occupy Democrats app for your iPhone by clicking here or for your Android by clicking here.Add your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the President’s crimes. IMPEACH DONALD TRUMP!","Violators would be subject to suspension, expulsion, or other disciplinary action. The bill has sparked outrage among civil rights groups and LGBTQ advocates who argue that it violates the rights of transgender students and perpetuates a harmful binary view of gender.

However, Cole and his supporters argue that the bill is necessary to protect the privacy and safety of all students. They claim that it is not about discriminating against transgender students, but rather about ensuring that students use facilities that match their biological sex.

The bill has also sparked a broader national conversation about the role of gender in society and the rights of transgender individuals. Some conservative lawmakers have proposed similar measures in other states, while others have denounced the bill as discriminatory and out of touch with modern values.

The Virginia bill is expected to face significant opposition in the legislature, but its introduction has underscored the ongoing struggle for transgender rights and the challenges that still remain in achieving full equality for all Americans."

The decision to create the statue has sparked controversy, with critics arguing that it is excessive and egotistical. However, the White House has defended the decision, stating that the statue is a way to honor the President's legacy and that it will be a lasting tribute to his time in office.

The President himself has remained quiet on the issue, but a spokesperson for the President has stated that he is ""humbled and honored"" to have the statue created in his honor.

The installation of the statue is expected to take place in the coming months, and it will be the first time a life-sized statue of a sitting President has been displayed in the White House."

Perhaps we could figure out why they’re risking their lives entering both America and European countries if “western culture” offends them so!According to the Islamic activist group, Hizb-ut-Tahrir, Australia is enforcing democratic values and a “disputed view” of history which contradicts Islamic beliefs. According to their spokesman, Unthman Badar, “Requiring schoolchildren to sing the national anthem, and the citizenship pledge supporting democratic values, are a part of an oppressive campaign by Australian authorities of ‘forced assimilation’ of the Muslim community.”Here’s the pledge:From this time forward, [under God,]I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people,whose democratic beliefs I share,whose rights and liberties I respect, andwhose laws I will uphold and obey.Pretty oppressive, right? If you are graciously accepted into a country and you can’t even say that pledge, is there any chance of assimilating into the culture? Here’s the national anthem:Australians all let us rejoice,For we are young and free; We’ve golden soil and wealth for toil; Our home is girt by sea; Our land abounds in nature’s gifts Of beauty rich and rare; In history’s page, let every stage Advance Australia Fair.

Muslims everywhere act like this when they reach a certain percentage of a western nation’s population, because it is all part of the great plan to achieve a global totalitarian theocracy. WQe cannot let them get away with these things!Either assimilate, or LEAVE.They are Muslim first, last and always. Geographic boundaries and national laws mean nothing to them.

How about you go back where your from!! Next they will demand that Australian’s convert or be beheaded!It makes me sick that our children were denied the American flag under Obama, and couldn’t pray… but Muslim children can and do.. we are denied Christ but they are not denied Allah during school hours! This is wrong on more than one level!

Now the state of California has appointed its first “unprotected” illegal alien in state office after Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de León (D-Los Angeles) appointed Lizbeth Mateo an advisory committee.The committee’s formal name is a bureaucratic mouthful — the California Student Opportunity and Access Program Project Grant Advisory Committee, or “Cal-SOAP,” for short — but its mission is one that will be familiar to Mateo: to find ways to help students from underserved communities go to collegeMateo is aa 33-year-old attorney and civil rights activist who was born in Mexico and came to the United States illegally at the age of 14 with her parents, who are also illegal aliens, according to the Sacramento Bee. She often complains that illegal aliens are treated unjustly and are not adequately represented in state government. As a result, she describes her appointment as a means towards correcting that alleged injustice.Mateo said via Fox News – “While undocumented students have become more visible in our state, they remain underrepresented in places where decisions that affect them are being made.”Trending: Melania Just Fired Them ALL! ‘That Is Not Acceptable Here – I Won’t Allow It!’Senate Bill 174 made Mateo’s appointment possible by amending existing state law to allow the appointment of any resident over the age of 18 to a civil office regardless of citizenship or immigration status. California law currently states that someone is incapable of holding office if they are not a citizen at the time of their appointment.“California is stronger when we utilize talents of all our residents, and opening state and local boards and commissions to every Californian will allow us to better serve our diverse communities,” Sen. Ricardo Lara, D-Bell Gardens, and the bill’s author said in a statement. “Undocumented Californians are our neighbors, co-workers, and parents, and as lawmakers, we can’t make good policy if their voices are left out of the discussion.”It marked the first time the Senate appointed someone living within the borders of the United States illegally to a state post. De León’s office attempted to make the argument that the appointment was perfectly legal because Mateo’s committee is advisory in nature only and not delegated to adopt laws and regulations or allocate state funds.Mateo took to Twitter to celebrate tweeting – In #lawschool I often wondered if I was fit to b in #lawjournal, #mootcourt bc not many ppl w/ my same background did.

(@LizbethMateo) March 15, 2018Interestingly enough, however, Moteo seems to be confused about which country she prefers and which country has her loyalty.","A new proposal has been introduced in the California State Senate that would allow illegal aliens residing in the state to serve on all state and local boards and commissions, in defiance of federal immigration laws. The legislation, SB 547, was introduced by Senator Maria Estrada and has been referred to the Senate Committee on Legislative Counsel.

Under the proposed law, illegal aliens would be eligible to serve on any state or local board or commission, including those that make decisions on issues such as education, healthcare, and public safety. The move has sparked outrage among some legal residents of the state, who argue that it is unfair for those who have broken the law to be given such a privilege.

Supporters of the legislation, however, argue that it would help to promote diversity and inclusion in decision-making processes. They also argue that it would not cost the state any additional money, as illegal aliens are already paying taxes and contributing to the state's economy.

The proposal is likely to face stiff opposition in the state legislature, with many lawmakers expressing concern about the potential impact on public safety and the rule of law. However, Senator Estrada is confident that the bill will pass, and has vowed to fight for the rights of illegal aliens in the state.

In a statement, Governor Gavin Newsom declined to comment on the specific legislation, but said that he supports efforts to promote diversity and inclusion in all aspects of state government. However, he also emphasized the importance of upholding federal immigration laws and protecting public safety.

The proposal has sparked a heated debate in California, with supporters and opponents of the legislation expressing their views in public forums and on social media. The issue is likely to continue to be a source of controversy in the coming weeks and months, as the state legislature considers the proposal and the public weighs in on the issue."

The White House is now free of all pagan gods and idols, and contains only Christian iconography.“Because apparently during the eight years when Obama was there, and maybe even some of the presidents before him, there were all kinds of idol gods and images and all kinds of artifacts in there that were demonic, even some of the stuff from the Clinton era,” Begley said.The White House pastor then related that the First Lady said, “‘You’ve got to get all of that out of there and send in some preachers and priests‘” – she wanted respected Christian leaders — to go in and cleanse the White House or, ‘I will not spend one night in it.’”“I have to say, when the president allowed 40 pastors to come in to the White House and anoint him with oil and lay their hands and pray on him—seven times he’s done this—that is unheard of,” Begley said. “We haven’t ever – the guy’s got flaws, we all do.

Begley claims that Melania has expressed concern about the presence of ""pagan idols and demonic artifacts"" left over from the Clinton and Obama years, and has insisted that these be removed before she will agree to move in.

The news has caused a stir among both supporters and critics of the President, with some expressing concern about the First Lady's beliefs and others dismissing the claims as baseless. However, the White House has refused to comment on the matter, leaving the public to speculate about the nature of Melania's alleged demands.

It is worth noting that Melania Trump has not publicly commented on the matter, and there is no independent verification of Begley's claims. Some have suggested that the pastor's statements may be part of a broader effort to promote his own religious views and gain attention from the media.

Regardless of the truth behind the claims, the situation has highlighted the complex and often controversial role that religion plays in American politics. While many politicians and religious leaders seek to use their faith as a source of inspiration and guidance, others are accused of using it to manipulate public opinion and further their own interests."

Not exactly the best group to be in agreement with on an issue like this.Renato Sabbadini, the executive director of The International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, said:“It is unconscionable to think that there are hundreds of millions of people living in states where somebody may be executed simply because of whom they love.” “This is a monumental moment where the international community has publicly highlighted that these horrific laws simply must end.”Since taking office, Trump has made a number of political appointments and policy moves against the LGBT community, including:Having The Department of Justice and Department of Education rescind guidance that defended the rights of transgender students to safety use bathrooms at schools that correspond to their gender identity.Saying publicly that transgenders could no longer serve in the military, and then issuing a directive to the Department of Defense to implement such an order.Signing an executive order in March that rescinded an Obama-era rule that companies have to prove they treat LGBT employees fairly.Fortunately, the measure passed with 27 countries voting for it, but it still sends a chilling message about a new United States agenda on human rights.","(Beware: The news you generate might be considered offensive, disturbing or controversial)"

Well, it isn’t working at all.As I said above, Villanueva is the only member of that ‘team’ that stood up for America and he was then muscled by thugs threatening his life and livelihood and who forced him to do a miserable retraction of his good, patriotic deed.

Trump has been urging team owners to fire players who fail to stand during the anthem, claiming that their actions are disrespectful to the American flag, the veterans, and the national anthem. However, the NFL may not be willing to listen to the President's demands.

In response to Trump's criticism, Fox Sports has launched a campaign to support the President's message. The network is using its platform to amplify Trump's voice and to rally support for his cause. According to Fox Sports, the NFL's failure to take action against players who do not stand during the national anthem is a slap in the face to the millions of Americans who have served and sacrificed for their country.

Fox Sports is urging NFL team owners to take a stand and to show their support for the veterans and the American flag. The network believes that if the NFL does not take action, it will be sending a message that it does not care about the sacrifices of our nation's heroes.

The NFL has faced mounting criticism for its handling of the anthem protests, with some fans and sponsors threatening to boycott the league. However, team owners have so far refused to take a stance on the issue, citing the players' right to free speech.

It remains to be seen whether the NFL will listen to Trump's demands, but one thing is clear: Fox Sports is committed to amplifying the President's message and to rallying support for his cause."

Following the publication of an erroneous transcript, journalists and liberal pundits are spreading fake news about what Trump actually said in a rush to condemn him.Politico’s White House reporter Annie Karni was among the first to falsely highlight that Trump had referred to the alt-right as “us” in his speech. “Just noticed the use of ‘us’ in this transcript,” wrote Karni in a now-deleted tweet.“Okay, what about the alt-left that came charging at us?” she wrongly quoted the president as sayingSpeaking to the press, Trump stated that members of the “alt-left” (which is commonly understood to be made up of Antifa, Black Lives Matter, and other social justice groups) were equally responsible for violence as their alt-right counterparts.In the speech, Trump clearly says “Okay, what about the alt-left that came charging at ‘em?”.@realDonaldTrump gave the media DAYS to call out the antifa, BLM, etc Instead the #FakeNews covered for them…today it blew up on them. pic.twitter.com/QqDgwenIZD — Paul Nehlen (@pnehlen) August 15, 2017As Karni’s tweet made the rounds on Twitter, some—including CNN’s Brian Stelter cast some doubt on the transcript. “Transcript may be funky,” he wrote.Others, like New York Times’ Maggie Haberman, were less discerning and more eager to spread the fake news to thousands of her followers.Haberman corrected herself after dozens of people who listened to the clip pointed out the falsehood.Despite her corrections, variations of the fake news continued to circulate on Twitter as some.

Following complaints on Twitter, the transcript has been updated with a correction ","Dinesh D'Souza, a well-known conservative author and political commentator, has made a groundbreaking discovery that shatters the left's entire narrative on the recent events in Charlottesville, Virginia. In a recent interview, D'Souza revealed that the white supremacist who plowed his car into a group of counter-protesters, killing one and injuring several others, was actually a Democrat who supported former President Barack Obama.

According to D'Souza, the evidence he uncovered shows that the driver, who has since been identified as James Alex Fields Jr., was a vocal supporter of Obama and had even participated in an anti-Trump rally in 2016. D'Souza argues that this discovery exposes the left's efforts to politicize the tragedy in Charlottesville and demonize Republicans and conservatives.

D'Souza's findings have sparked a heated debate among political analysts and commentators, with many on the left dismissing his claims as a conspiracy theory. However, D'Souza stands by his research and is calling on the media to report the facts accurately and fairly.

The revelation that the Charlottesville attacker was a Democrat has raised questions about the motives behind his actions and whether his political affiliation played a role in the violence that erupted in the Virginia city. While the investigation into the attack is ongoing, D'Souza's discovery has shed new light on the complex and divisive issue of race and politics in America."

The Hollywood star revealed that President Donald Trump had decided to pull the United States out of the Paris Climate Change Agreement, a move that has been met with widespread criticism and concern from environmentalists and scientists around the world.

Pitt, who is known for his commitment to environmental causes, expressed his disappointment at the decision and urged the American public to take action to protect the planet. 'Climate change is real and it's happening right now,' he said. 'We can't afford to ignore it any longer. We need to come together and take action to protect our planet for future generations.'

The decision to pull out of the Paris Agreement has been widely criticized by environmentalists and scientists, who argue that it is a major setback in the fight against climate change. The agreement, which was signed by 195 countries, aims to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

Pitt's appearance on the show comes at a time of growing concern about the effects of climate change, and his message is a stark reminder of the urgent need for action. With the future of our planet at stake, it is more important than ever to work together to protect it."""

The Obama administration had approved a controversial deal in 2010 that gave Moscow control of a large swath of American uranium, despite the FBI's findings.

The deal, which was strongly criticized by many Republicans, allowed Russia to gain control of 20% of America's uranium supply. The FBI had gathered substantial evidence of bribery, kickbacks, extortion, and money laundering by Russian nuclear industry officials, all aimed at expanding Vladimir Putin's atomic energy business in the United States.

The evidence was contained in government documents and interviews with FBI and other law enforcement officials. The FBI had launched a major investigation into the Russian nuclear industry's activities in the United States, which led to the discovery of the corruption and illegal activities.

The FBI had also uncovered evidence of violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bans bribes to foreign officials. The investigation had revealed that Russian officials had paid millions of dollars in bribes to secure business deals in the nuclear industry.

The FBI had shared its findings with other government agencies, including the State Department and the Department of Justice, but the deal was still approved by the Obama administration. The approval had raised concerns among many lawmakers and national security experts about the potential threat to national security posed by Russia's control of a significant portion of America's uranium supply.

The controversy over the uranium deal had also led to calls for a congressional investigation into the matter. Republican lawmakers had accused the Obama administration of approving the deal despite the evidence of corruption and illegal activities by Russian officials.

The FBI's investigation had highlighted the need for stronger safeguards to prevent foreign interference in the US nuclear industry. The revelations had also raised questions about the Obama administration's handling of national security issues and its relationship with Russia.

In light of the FBI's findings, many had called for a review of the uranium deal to determine its impact on national security. The scandal had also raised concerns about the need for greater transparency in government decision-making and the potential risks of foreign influence in US politics."

The study, which followed over 4,000 students from diverse backgrounds over a period of five years, found that students who were involved in extracurricular activities had higher GPAs, were more likely to graduate high school on time, and had better social skills than those who did not participate in such activities.

The researchers attribute these findings to the fact that after-school activities provide students with opportunities to develop skills such as teamwork, time management, and problem-solving, which can be beneficial in both their academic and personal lives. Additionally, the study found that students who participate in extracurricular activities are more likely to form positive relationships with their peers and teachers, which can have a positive impact on their academic performance and overall well-being.

The study's findings come at a time when many schools are cutting back on funding for after-school programs due to budget constraints. However, the researchers argue that investing in after-school activities could have long-term benefits for both students and society as a whole.

""Our study shows that after-school activities are not just a nice thing to have, they are essential for the development of students,"" said lead researcher Dr. Maria Rodriguez. ""We hope that these findings will encourage schools and policymakers to prioritize funding for these programs and recognize the value they provide to students.""

Overall, the study highlights the importance of after-school activities in promoting academic and social development among students. As Dr. Rodriguez notes, ""By providing students with opportunities to explore their interests and develop new skills, after-school activities can help set them up for success both in school and in life."""

politifact14310,1,0,"By AM Conservative Post authorFareed Zakaria, CNN host of ‘Foreign Affairs,’ has in his private blog called for the merciless rape of white females by Islamic minority groups shortly after openly gloating over the rise in premature deaths of white males in his article in The Washington Post.Zakaria’s blog post unapologetically calls to increase the death rate of white Middle America by systematically targeting Caucasian females.“The white race is rightfully failing because it is a foolish, arrogant, and self-absorbed ethnicity that has racism infused into its very genes. While the sharp incline of the death rate of white males is a good start, the solution to the ‘white question’ will not be reached until there is a sharp decline in the population of white females as well. Much more needs to be done in this regard if this country is ever to advance from its ignorant backwardness towards being an actually inhabitable nation.Thankfully, the Prophet Muhammad has given us a foolproof way to speed up the decline of a vanquished nation by treating their women as our sex slaves. They may try and fight the unstoppable tide, but their resistance will grow only weaker as the white race loses its ability to keep its head above water. We may yet see some final convulsions before white Middle America is decreased to a manageable number where it can be more easily controlled.”The blog post was removed from Zakaria’s blog within a few hours, after it began to receive negative attention.CNN officials have refused to take action against their employee.“Every death of a white person brings tears of joy to my eyes,” Zakaria posted on his Twitter account shortly after having to remove his blog post, in what is believed to be a passive-aggressive response to his critics.Photo Credit: World Economic Forum","Zakaria, in his recent blog post, has advocated for a brutal and violent attack on white women in America, calling it a ""justice"" for the ""historical wrongs"" that have been committed against minorities. The CNN host's shocking statement has sparked outrage among many, with many calling for Zakaria's immediate termination from his position as host of ""Foreign Affairs.""

In his blog post, Zakaria reportedly wrote, ""The time has come for minorities in America to take revenge on the white female population for the centuries of oppression and discrimination they have faced. This is a just and necessary action to right the wrongs of history.""

The blog post has since been removed from Zakaria's website, but the damage has already been done. Many are calling for Zakaria to be held accountable for his hateful and dangerous rhetoric.

Zakaria, a well-known journalist and commentator, has been widely criticized in the past for his controversial views on race and immigration. This latest statement, however, has crossed a line and many are calling for him to be fired from his position at CNN.

In a statement released by CNN, the network said it ""strongly condemns the abhorrent and distorted views expressed by Fareed Zakaria in his personal blog."" The statement continued, ""His comments do not reflect the values of CNN or the journalism we stand for. We are reviewing the matter and will take appropriate action.""

Zakaria has yet to respond to the controversy surrounding his blog post. It remains to be seen whether he will issue an apology or continue to defend his hateful rhetoric."

Archaeologists associated with Niagara University of and master divers from the U.S Coast Guard were mobilized on site to determine what it was, and they soon realized that they were dealing with a German submarine that sank during World War II.A wreck recovery vessel of the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society was mandated to refloat the ship and bring it back to Niagara Falls, where it must be restored before becoming a museum ship. The delicate recovery operation took nearly 30 hours to complete, but the submarine was finally brought down on the bank with relative ease.The divers of the U.S. Coast guard braved the frigid water temperature to go attach cables to the wreck for the recovery operation.The submarine was identified as the UX-791, a unique experimental German submarine, based on the U-1200 model, and known to have participated in the “Battle of the St. Lawrence”. It was reported missing in 1943 and was believed to have been sunk near the Canadian coastProfessor Mark Carpenter, who leads the team of archaeologists, believes that the U-boat could have traveled up the St-Lawrence River, all the way to the Great Lakes, where it intended to disturb the American economy.A report from the dated from February 1943 suggests, that the ship could have attacked and destroyed three cargo ships and two fishing vessels, even damaging the USS Sable (IX-81), an aircraft carrier of the U.S. navy that was used for training in the Great Lakes, before finally being sunk by anti-sub grenades launched by a Canadian frigate.“We have known for a long time that the Nazis had sent some of their U-boats in the St-Lawrence River, but this is the first proof that they actually reached the Great Lakes,” Professor Carpenter told reporters. “This could explain the mysterious ship disappearances that took place in the region in 1943, and the reported “Battle of Niagara Falls” which had always been dismissed as a collective hallucination caused by fear.”The restoration of the submarine could take more than two years, but once completed, the museum ship is expected to become one of the major tourist attractions of the region.","Niagara Falls, 24th April, 2023 - In a major breakthrough in the history of underwater exploration, divers from the U.S coast guard successfully completed a delicate wreck recovery operation to bring to the surface a Nazi submarine discovered two weeks ago at the bottom of Lake Ontario.

The submarine, believed to have been used during World War II, was found in pristine condition, providing valuable insights into the naval capabilities of the Axis powers during the war. The operation was carried out with the utmost care to preserve the integrity of the submarine and its contents, with the assistance of specialized equipment and expertise.

The recovery operation is expected to provide a wealth of information to historians and researchers, shedding new light on the role of the Nazi submarines in the war effort. The U.S coast guard is working closely with other organizations to analyze and document the findings, which are expected to provide a significant contribution to the understanding of the history of the war.

The discovery of the Nazi submarine has sparked intense interest and curiosity among the general public, with many eager to learn more about the operation and its significance. The U.S coast guard has expressed its commitment to sharing the findings with the public and educating people on the importance of preserving our underwater heritage.

The operation is a testament to the dedication and expertise of the U.S coast guard, who continue to play a crucial role in preserving our nation's maritime history. With the recovery of this submarine, we are one step closer to uncovering the secrets of the past and understanding the impact of the war on our world today."

He converted to Islam two years ago.However, what those reports don’t mention is that the would-be terrorist also ‘liked’ numerous Antifa pages, suggesting he supported the movement.Jameson liked Berkeley Antifa, Antifa California, Antifa Scaramento and White Rose Antifa Portland, an archived version of his Facebook profile confirms.He also liked a number of other far-left pages, including ‘Trump Resistance Movement’, ‘Things Trump Supporters Say’, ‘US Democratic Socialists’, ‘Progressive Politics’, and ‘Jeremy Corbyn’.Some of Jameson’s favorite news organisations were The Young Turks, CNN, BuzzFeed and Al Jazeera. He also liked a number of pro-vegan pages.The jihadist also sympathised with a number of pro-Muslim pages, including ‘Documenting Oppression Against Muslims, ‘Islam – Religion of Peace’ and ‘Stunning Hijabs’, as well as numerous anti-Israel activist pages.Jameson’s Facebook likes confirm that his political leanings were a mixture of radical far-left ideology and Islamism.As we have documented, ISIS has previously attempted to reach out to those on the far-left as part of an attempt to create militant offshoot cells within the United States and Western Europe.A passage from the ISIS manifesto Black Flags from Rome entitled ‘European Muslims allying with Left-Wing activists’ details a plan to recruit those on the far left because they broadly share the same goals as radical Islamists.During the anti-Trump inauguration riots back in January, one Antifa supporter was seen displaying an ISIS flag and beheading videos on his phone in an effort to intimidate Trump supporters in Washington, DC.According to a recently revealed FBI field report, Antifa supporters have stored improvised explosives on college campuses.

You know who you are. Mark my word….You’re all going down. You know who you are. Mark my word…. — 🇺🇸MFLYNNJR🇺🇸 (@mflynnJR) May 21, 2018t’s now being reported that less than a week after Stefan Halper was confirmed to be an informant for the FBI who was the one who infiltrated the Trump campaign back in 2016, there is now alleged confirmation that the 73-year-old Oxford University professor and former U.S. government official was paid handsomely by the Obama administration starting in 2012 for various research projects.Halper, who is said to be a longtime CIA and FBI asset, once even reportedly ran a spy-operation on the Jimmy Carter administration during the late 70’s, was recruited by the FBI to spy on several Trump campaign aides during the 2016 U.S. election.But here is the kicker. An astringent search of public records is now revealing that between 2012 and 2018, Halper received a total of $1,058,161 from the Department of Defense. Why would anyone receive that kind of money from the DOJ? Especially someone like Halper?Stefan Halper was the same person who invited George Papadopolous to London, where he just so happened to sit down next to that infamous Australian “Diplomat” (who also worked with the Clinton Foundation) — Jacob Wohl (@JacobAWohl) May 11, 2018In essence, Stefan Halper was the bag-man who enabled Brennan and Clapper to carry out the spying against the Trump Campaign at Obama’s request — Jacob Wohl (@JacobAWohl) May 11, 2018Interestingly enough, the most recent payment to Halper for $411,575 was made in two different installments which had a start date of September 26, 2016, only three days after a September 23 news article by Michael Isikoff was published about Trump aide Carter Page. The article used information fed to Isikoff by the fake Russian dossier creator Christopher Steele. It was later confirmed that the FBI used that article, along with the unverified Russian dossier as supporting evidence in a FISA warrant application for Page.Via 100% Fed Up:“According to the Website USASPENDING.gov, the payments to Halper are for “RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES AND HUMANITIES (2012),” “RESEARCH AND STUDIES – THE YEAR 2030, (2014)”, “RUSSIA-CHINA RELATIONSHIP STUDY.

The tweet from Michael Flynn Jr., which was posted just hours ago, has caused quite a stir among political observers and conspiracy theorists alike. While the exact meaning of the tweet is still up for debate, some have interpreted it as a reference to the payments that have been traced from the corrupt Barack Hussein Obama regime to the now notorious FBI informant, Stephan Halper.

Michael Flynn Jr.’s tweet reads: “You can’t handle the truth.” The statement is a famous line from the 1992 film A Few Good Men, which starred Jack Nicholson as a Marine Corps colonel and Tom Cruise as a young Navy lawyer. In the film, the line is used by Nicholson’s character, who is defending the actions of a group of Marines accused of murder.

While some have speculated that Michael Flynn Jr.’s tweet may be a reference to the ongoing investigation into the Obama administration’s alleged corruption, it is important to note that there is no concrete evidence to support this claim. It is possible that the tweet is simply a reference to the film or a personal statement from Flynn Jr. regarding the state of the country.

However, given the recent developments in the investigation into the Obama administration’s alleged wrongdoing, it is not surprising that political observers and conspiracy theorists are speculating about the meaning of the tweet. The fact that Michael Flynn Jr. is the son of former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, who was fired by President Trump in 2017, has also added to the intrigue surrounding the tweet.

In any case, it is clear that Michael Flynn Jr.’s tweet has sparked a lot of interest and discussion. As the investigation into the Obama administration’s alleged corruption continues, it is likely that we will see more developments in the coming days and weeks."

Bush reportedly calling it “some weird s--t” and Jimmy Carter saying he “flinched” when Trump appeared to back off America's commitment to human rights.Story Continued BelowIn Trump’s America, the five living former presidents are walking a fine line, attempting to defend their legacies while also trying to respect the “unwritten rule” that former presidents avoid undermining their successors.“The immediate former presidents have been more active in their criticism of the current president,” George C. Edwards, a presidential historian at Texas A&M, said. “This kind of thing has been going on throughout history, but normally it’s not very much. This is very early in a tenure and to have former presidents being critical of the president… is pretty unusual.”As Obama returns to the public spotlight, his former aides have made it clear he has no intention of talking much about Trump. However, he’s made his displeasure clear.Obama, who campaigned heavily for Hillary Clinton, said he was “heartened” by the protests following Trump’s immigration ban targeting Muslim-majority countries. He also released a lengthy statement defending the Affordable Care Act against Trump’s attempts to repeal it.At a speech in Boston on Sunday night, Obama avoided mentioning Trump by name, but again forcefully defended his signature health care legislation and mentioned immigration reform. “I expect to be busy, if not with a second career, at least a second act,” Obama said Sunday.And on Monday, Obama’s aides aggressively pushed back against Trump for trying to blame his predecessor for the woes associated with Trump’s disgraced former national security adviser Michael Flynn. While Trump and White House press secretary Sean Spicer have repeatedly denounced Obama for not revoking Flynn’s security clearance, Obama aides told reporters that Obama tried to warn Trump about Flynn’s erratic nature.George W. Bush, meanwhile, has lobbed thinly veiled critiques of Trump on his approach to the press and the travel ban from some Muslim-majority countries. “I consider the media to be indispensable to democracy,” Bush said in an interview with “Today” in February. “We need an independent media to hold people like me to account.”As for the travel ban, Bush was restrained but clear in his concern. “I am for an immigration policy that's welcoming and upholds the law,” Bush said.Carter also voiced concerns after Trump’s inauguration. During an early April appearance at Emory University, he said he wanted to avoid addressing politics but he hoped the women’s movement would be “invigorated” by Trump and that he didn’t see “any glimmer of hope” from the administration on race and gender issues.Bill Clinton, who was harshly critical of Trump during the Manhattan businessman’s presidential campaign, didn’t mince words about Trump when he ran into a local newspaper editor while holiday shopping. “He doesn’t know much,” Clinton said in late December. “One thing he does know is how to get angry white men to vote for him.”George H.W.

For example, Herbert Hoover criticized Franklin D. Roosevelt, his successor.“We’ve seen some criticism already of th","George W. Bush, the former US President, has made a rare foray into the political arena, criticizing his successor, President Donald Trump, on two key policy issues. Bush has expressed concern over Trump's travel ban, which restricts entry to the US from seven Muslim-majority countries, and his approach to the media, which has been characterized by hostility and attacks on the credibility of news outlets.

In a speech at a forum hosted by the George W. Bush Institute in New York City, Bush spoke out against the travel ban, stating that it was not in the best interests of the US to reject people based on their religion. He also criticized Trump's approach to the media, stating that a free press was essential to democracy and that attacks on the media were ""enormously damaging"" to the country.

Bush's comments have been widely interpreted as thinly-veiled critiques of Trump, who has been known for his controversial and divisive policies. While Bush did not mention Trump by name, his criticisms were seen as a direct rebuke of the current administration's policies.

The former President's comments come at a time when the country is deeply divided along political lines, with many Americans feeling frustrated and angry about the state of the nation. Bush's intervention in the political arena is seen as a sign of the deepening crisis in the US, as well as a reminder of the need for bipartisan cooperation and unity."

In a surprising move, Target CEO Brian Cornell announced today that the retail giant will be discontinuing sales of the Holy Bible. The decision has sparked outrage among Christian groups and customers alike, who see it as an attack on their religious beliefs.

Target has been selling the Bible for many years, and it was one of the top-selling items in its book section. However, Cornell stated that the decision to stop selling the Bible was a business decision based on declining sales and the company's focus on diversity and inclusivity.

This decision has been met with backlash from Christian groups, who are calling for a boycott of Target. Many believe that Target is attacking their religious beliefs and is trying to push its progressive agenda on customers.

Target has responded to the criticism by stating that it will continue to offer a wide range of religious items, including other Bibles and religious books. The company also stated that it respects the beliefs of all its customers and will continue to serve them regardless of their religion.

CloseThe “War on Christmas” catchphrase was coined by former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly, who claimed in 2004 that Christmas was “under siege” by “secular progressives.” It was triggered when the department store Macy’s decided not to greet customers with “Merry Christmas” but to wish them “Happy Holidays” instead.O’Reilly seized on that as an example of an organized effort to eliminate Christian religious symbols in American public life. He and other right-wing commentators were following in the footsteps of a tradition dating back to the 1950s and the far-right John Birch Society, which claimed a communist conspiracy was hell-bent on taking “the Christ out of Christmas,” also blaming ""fantatics"" at the UN for trying to ""poison the 1959 Christmas season with their high-pressure propaganda."">>Ex-Marine who plotted San Francisco Christmas attack claims he was angry about Trump 'giving Jerusalem to the Jews'skip - Trump Christmas tweetThis is your land, this is your home, and it's your voice that matters the most.

During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump frequently denounced the supposed War on Christmas, a conservative myth that claims there is a conspiracy to remove the religious aspect from the holiday season. The President’s stance on the issue has been met with concern and apprehension by many Americans, particularly those who do not celebrate Christmas.

As the first holiday season under Trump's administration approached, non-Christians feared that the President's emphasis on Christmas could lead to a more religiously charged, exclusive, and divisive holiday season. Many were worried that the President's policies and rhetoric would further marginalize those who do not celebrate Christmas, leading to feelings of exclusion and animosity.

However, despite these concerns, the Trump administration's holiday season turned out to be relatively subdued. The President did not make any overtly religious or divisive statements, and the White House's holiday decorations were not overtly Christmas-themed. Nonetheless, the memory of the President's past statements and actions lingers, and many non-Christians remain wary of the potential for religiously charged and exclusionary policies in the future."
politifact13853,1,1,"9.6k SHARES Share Tweet ShareDe Soto, Missouri – Parents of a three-month old baby were horrified to discover their babysitter had turned into a crystal meth-smoking cannibal when they found the remains of their child cooked in the microwave.According to police report, the young parents, were out at the movies before they came back home to find a confused babysitter under the influence of alcohol and crystal meth who had lost consciousness and was covered in blood in the family’s living room.Moments later, the parents made the gruesome discovery when the young mother saw something moving in microwave.The 16-year-old babysitter named ‘Anna Ritchie’, claims she had brought some crystal meth and only took a few hits before she became hungry and eventually lost consciousness.“I just took a few hits because I was bored and wanted to stay awake,” she told Officer Robert. “All I remember is that I started getting really hungry, ate some chicken wings and passed out” recalls the police officer, visibly traumatized by the latest events.The 3-month-old child was found in the microwave, covered in barbecue sauce, and was rushed to Springfield’s Mercy Hospital where doctors do not fear for his life.“Apparently, the baby sitter tried to cook the baby in the microwave oven but she was unable to do so, and was probably disoriented and lost consciousness moments later,” explained Sheriff Deputy Anderson James of the Jefferson County Police Department. “Teeth marks were found on the baby’s arms and legs but luckily he is unharmed” he acknowledged, visibly distraught by the whole affair.The state of Missouri has led, for more than a decade, the nation in methamphetamine busts. A recent 2015 state-wide study revealed that more than 60% of adults aged 21 and higher have tried crystal meth at least once and close to 40% of respondents believed crystal meth should be decriminalized as a schedule 2 drug for medical use in treatment.","The incident happened on Monday evening when the parents, who were out to dinner with friends, received a call from their babysitter informing them that their baby had been crying non-stop and that she had given the baby a dose of baby Tylenol to calm him down. Concerned, the parents asked if they could come home early, but were told that the baby had fallen asleep and that everything was fine. When the parents arrived home, they found the front door ajar and their baby's room light on. As they entered the room, they were confronted with a scene of horror: their baby's crib was empty, and in the microwave they found the remains of their child, cooked to a crisp. The babysitter was nowhere to be found, but police later discovered her hiding in the attic, high on crystal meth and surrounded by human remains. She confessed to the crime and is now in police custody. The parents are understandably devastated by the loss of their child and are seeking counseling to cope with their grief."

The daughter of legendary civil rights activist Rosa Parks.Trump, who stood side by side with Rosa Parks while she was still alive and received praise for his work improving the community for black youths, recently condemned the violence on “many sides” – both the ironically named “antifa” who showed up to create problems at the “Unite the Right” rally and those who overreacted to the violent Communists attacking them.For some, this isn’t good enough but Muriel Parks-Rosenberg stepped in on Friday to drop a truth bomb on liberals.“President Trump’s reaction has been criticized by the Left, but I don’t see what he did wrong,” she said in a speech at the Kennedy Center. “He strongly spoke out against hate both from those who make racial animus their primary cause and anarchists who showed up hoping to watch the world burn.”“My mother would have been proud of the President’s words,” she told the crowd of about 500 people. “Liberals who seek to use this rally to further their cause and attack President Trump need to go away and never come back.”","---

Rosa Parks' daughter speaks out against Trump racism accusations

In a recent interview, Rosa Parks' daughter, Rosa Parks McCauley, has spoken out against the accusations of racism levelled at President Trump by liberals. Parks McCauley, who is a civil rights activist in her own right, has stated that she does not believe Trump to be a racist, despite the numerous claims made by his political opponents.

Parks McCauley's statement comes as no surprise, given her family's long history of fighting for racial equality in the United States. Her mother, Rosa Parks, famously refused to give up her seat on a Montgomery, Alabama bus in 1955, sparking the civil rights movement. Parks McCauley has continued her mother's legacy, working tirelessly to promote social justice and equality.

Despite her family's legacy, Parks McCauley has not shied away from speaking out against those who she believes are unfairly attacking the President. In her interview, she stated that she believes Trump is being unfairly targeted by liberals who are seeking to undermine his administration. She also criticised those who use the label of ""racist"" as a political tool, stating that it is a serious charge that should not be used lightly.

Parks McCauley's statement is a powerful reminder that the fight for racial equality is ongoing, and that it is important to approach issues with a critical eye. While many liberals may see Trump as a racist, it is important to remember that not everyone shares that view. As Parks McCauley's statement demonstrates, there are still many people who are fighting for racial equality, and who believe that it is possible to achieve progress without resorting to divisive and inflammatory rhetoric."
politifact14699,1,0,"Giant Squid Washes Ashore on Lake Michigan Michigan DNR were called to Leland to the report of a giant squid which had washed ashore. Michigan DNR Marine Biologist Dr. Debra Polowotski arrived at Good Harbor Bay and confirmed the 21 foot-long giant squid to be a very rare fresh-water species of genus Architeuthis. “We thought they were already in Lake Erie, we had no idea they were in Lake Michigan. This is first time there’s been an actual specimen recovered, so this is very exciting”, she said. It is believed that a few of the squid escaped from the Cleveland Sea World complex during the great Northeast blackout of 2003 when they were very young, and somehow made it into Lake Erie. According to Dr. Polowotski, the squid were kept contained in Lake Erie, as the Detroit River is too narrow and shallow for the squid to swim upstream. “They are intimidated by closed-in spaces. They need a lot of room. You have to remember that this is a very big animal”, she said. Dr. Polotwotski also confirmed that the squid is a female and further examination of the corpse indicated that it had recently laid eggs. “Hopefully the walleye can keep the tiny-giant squid population under control, else there is some cause for concern”, said Dr. Polowotski. “Boaters and swimmers really need to exercise some caution”. The animal was discovered by Bob Ritchie and his sister Jill, both of Romeo. “We were just, you know, taking an evening walk along the beach, heading out to the sandbar when we stumbled across it”, said Bob. “We were singing, drinking whiskey out of the bottle, not thinking about tomorrow. But something like this really does make you stop and think”, he said. DNR officials removed the animal from the beach and took it to an undisclosed location for further study.","A rare and mysterious creature washed ashore on Lake Michigan, causing a stir among locals and scientists alike. The Michigan Department of Natural Resources (DNR) received a report of a giant squid that had washed up on the shores of Leland, a small town located on the eastern shore of the lake.

Upon arrival, DNR officials were shocked to find a creature measuring over 10 feet in length, with long, curling tentacles and a distinctive beak-like mouth. The squid, believed to be a species known as Architeuthis, is typically found in deep ocean waters, making its appearance in Lake Michigan a highly unusual event.

Scientists from the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL) were called to the scene to examine the creature and gather samples for further study. They were eager to learn more about the squid's origins and how it came to be in the lake.

""This is a rare and exciting discovery,"" said Dr. Jane Smith, a marine biologist with GLERL. ""We have a limited understanding of Architeuthis and its migration patterns, so this is a unique opportunity to learn more about these fascinating creatures.""

While the appearance of the giant squid is sure to draw visitors and media attention to Leland, local officials are working to ensure that the creature is treated with respect and care. ""We want to make sure that everyone is able to enjoy this rare event while also ensuring that the squid is handled in a way that minimizes any potential impact on its well-being,"" said Leland Mayor John Doe.

The discovery of the giant squid has sparked interest and excitement among both scientists and the public alike, as everyone eagerly awaits further information about this mysterious and elusive creature."
politifact15188,1,0,"Orlando, Fl. – Weed smokers rejoice, The state of Florida can now be added to the growing list of US states that have past bills to legalize the use marijuana.The bill to legalize marijuana for medical and recreational use in the state was first presented at the state capital back in July is expected to be in place by Easter. Lawmakers have finally given the go-ahead citing it will jump-start the economy and create new jobs.“This bill is so much more than legalizing marijuana—it’s about legalizing opportunity and prosperity,” said Democratic leader Janet Cruz. “The state budget was due two weeks ago, and Florida simply can’t afford to wait any longer. We deserve a real plan to create new jobs and stimulate our lagging economy, and that’s what this bill is.”Cruz believes legalizing marijuana will help Florida’s economy, citing statistics from Colorado as an example.“In Colorado, legalizing marijuana generated $2.4 billion in economic activity and created more than 18,000 new jobs in a single year alone,” Cruz said.The bill introduced includes providing employment and benefit protections for marijuana users, requiring insurance coverage for medicinal marijuana for terminal illnesses and incorporating marijuana into current alcohol and tobacco educational curricula in schools.Previous attempts to legalize weed in the state has never received a public hearing or had a Republican cosponsor, Cruz said.","As of yesterday, a bill that would have allowed for the use of medical marijuana in the state of Florida was signed into law by Governor Rick Scott. This new law will allow for patients with certain medical conditions, such as cancer and epilepsy, to obtain a prescription for marijuana from a licensed physician.

While this is a major step forward for proponents of marijuana legalization, it is important to note that the law does come with certain restrictions and limitations. For example, smoking marijuana will still be illegal, and patients will only be able to obtain the drug in the form of an oil or pill.

Despite these limitations, many supporters of the new law are hailing it as a major victory for the movement to legalize marijuana in the United States. With the signing of this bill, Florida becomes the 26th state to pass legislation allowing for the use of medical marijuana, further chipping away at the longstanding prohibition on the drug.

Opponents of the new law have expressed concerns about the potential for abuse and the lack of regulation in the industry. However, supporters argue that the benefits of medical marijuana for patients with chronic illnesses outweigh these concerns.

In the end, the signing of this bill represents a significant step forward for the legalization of marijuana in the United States. While there is still much work to be done, the growing support for the legalization of marijuana is a sign that attitudes towards the drug are changing."

Some of the more pathetic and pandering individuals, however, have criticized the new law.The Guardian compares the law to Hitler:“There is little to smile about, however, when Zeman sets out what he sees as the threat being posed by radical Islamists – and even “moderate” Muslims, who he says could be radicalised to commit terror attacks as ordinary Germans were once inspired to fanatically back Hitler.”Yes, that’s right—because apparently Leftists think that protecting your nation from a cult of death, that rapes women, stones gays, and beheads thieves, is somehow “intolerant.” Well do you know what most Americans think?You’re damn right it’s intolerant! Why the HELL should we be tolerant of a barbaric religion that wants to take us back to the 500’s AD? We shouldn’t! We value freedom and family, and we WILL NOT have our country overrun by Islam.Thankfully, despite the overwhelming Leftist propaganda claiming that the law is “unfair,” and “discriminates,” against Muslims, conservatives all across the world have had their morale boosted.Despite what liberals may say about gun safety issues, The Czech Republic is actually one of the safest nations out there—6th safest in the world, to be exact.“Although Western European countries such as France, Belgium, Germany and the UK have suffered several terrorist attacks in recent years, the Czech Republic has not seen any attacks. The Global Peace Index 2016 ranked the country the sixth safest in the world.”After the past decade of liberal policies, pandering to immigrants, and welcoming terrorists into our country with open arms, many are proud to see that Europe is beginning to stand up for itself.

However as he was speaking to other physicians, he was not breaking the industry code of conduct.Gates has three children with his wife Melinda – Jennifer, Rory and Phoebe – born between 1996 and 2002, and according to his former doctor, they are all unvaccinated and healthy.The news that Bill Gates does not vaccinate his own children, despite being the world’s most active campaigner for mandatory vaccinations, should come as no surprise.

That’s about 17,000 of the wealthiest children, out of more than half a million, opting out of receiving vaccinations.Vaccine exemption percentages were highest in mostly white, high-income neighborhoods such as Orange County, Santa Barbara and parts of the Bay Area, according to CNN.The study, which was published in the American Journal of Public Heath, looked at more than 6,200 California schools and found vaccine exemptions were twice as common among kindergartners attending private institutions.“Very rich and privileged parents like the idea of herd immunity, but they don’t want to take the risks associated with vaccinations when it comes to their own children. They are worried about adverse reactions including autism.“","A physician who once served as the private doctor for Microsoft founder Bill Gates in the 1990s has revealed that Gates, a prominent advocate for vaccines, did not vaccinate his own children when they were young.

According to Dr. Jay Gordon, who treated Gates and his family in Seattle during the 1990s, Gates was ""adamant"" about not vaccinating his children, despite his strong support for vaccine initiatives through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

Dr. Gordon, who has been a critic of mandatory vaccination policies, said he was surprised by Gates' decision, given his public stance on the importance of vaccines.

Gates' decision not to vaccinate his children has raised questions about the effectiveness of vaccines and whether parents should have the right to choose whether or not to vaccinate their children.

Dr. Gordon's comments come as the United States faces a measles outbreak, with over 1,200 cases reported in 31 states as of February 13, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Gates has not publicly commented on his decision not to vaccinate his children, and it is unclear whether he still holds the same views on vaccines."

In an exclusive interview with CNN, Eric Trump emphasized that his father has always been committed to promoting equality and justice for all Americans, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background.

Eric Trump's remarks come amidst a renewed debate over his father's racial views, which have been the subject of intense scrutiny and criticism in recent months. Many have pointed to the President's past statements and policies, including his controversial remarks about immigrants and his handling of the Charlottesville protests, as evidence of his racial insensitivity, if not outright racism.

However, Eric Trump maintained that his father's actions and policies have consistently demonstrated a commitment to promoting diversity and inclusion. He cited the President's appointments of African American and Hispanic officials, as well as his support for criminal justice reform and infrastructure projects in urban areas, as evidence of his dedication to promoting equality and opportunity for all Americans.

Despite the ongoing controversy over his father's racial views, Eric Trump expressed confidence that the American people would ultimately recognize the President's commitment to equality and justice. He urged the media and the public to focus on the positive impact of his father's policies and to give credit where credit is due.

In conclusion, Eric Trump's dismissal of allegations that his father is racist as ""complete nonsense"" reflects a broader trend among the Trump family and their supporters to downplay concerns about the President's racial views. While the debate over his father's racial insensitivity is likely to continue, Eric Trump's remarks suggest that the Trump administration remains committed to promoting diversity and inclusion, and that they will continue to push back against criticisms of their policies and views on race."

Either rising sea temperatures and depleted fish stocks possibly led the shark to adventure itself further into the Great Lakes region.” he admits, visibly puzzled. “It is also possible it traveled to the region through underwater tunnels that interconnect between the Great Lakes,” he told reporters.According to authorities more than a hundred people reported missing in the area in the last decade may have fallen under the fangs of the gigantic beast, several local residents even suspecting its presence for a long time.U.S. Coast Guards reassured local residents that the occurrence of such a predator in the region’s waters “is highly unlikely” as sharks are not well adapted to freshwater systems.In 1916, a deadly shark attack near Presque Ile beach, in Lake Eerie, made national headlines, forcing local authorities to ban swimming in the region for over 14 years until the ban was lifted in 1930.","The shark was caught by a commercial fishing boat off the coast of Waukegan, IL, after it was spotted swimming in the lake. The Coast Guard, which was alerted to the incident, confirmed that the shark was a great white, and that it was estimated to weigh around 3,000 pounds.

""We have been investigating the disappearance of several people in the lake over the past decade, and this discovery could explain what happened to them,"" said Captain John Smith of the U.S. Coast Guard. ""We have never seen anything like this before in Lake Michigan.""

The shark, which is believed to be an adult male, was measured at 16 feet long and had several teeth that were reported to be up to 6 inches long. The shark was then transported to a nearby aquarium for further examination.

Experts are still trying to determine how the shark ended up in the lake, but some believe that it could have been attracted by the abundance of food in the area. The discovery has sparked concern among local residents and officials, who are now taking measures to ensure the safety of those who use the lake for recreation.

""This is a wake-up call for everyone who enjoys the lake,"" said Mayor Jane Doe. ""We need to be aware of the dangers that exist in the water, and take steps to protect ourselves."""
politifact15262,1,0,"One of the most contentious issues in the State of Missouri’s case against Gov. Eric Greitens has been the whereabouts of an incriminating photo that he is alleged to have taken and disseminated.A deposition of the woman (K.S.) in question, the woman who accused Greitens of taking a nude photo of her, reveals one new shocking bit of evidence. The woman may have dreamed up the incident at the heart of the criminal case.The defense team’s April 8 motion to compel immediate production of all exculpatory evidence reports the following exchange.When the defense counsel asked K.S., “Did you ever see [Greitens] in possession of a camera or phone?” she answered: “Not to my knowledge. I didn’t see him with it.”The question was then asked, “And as you sit here now, you cannot state under oath that you ever saw him in possession of a camera – with a camera or a phone?”K.S. replied, “Correct.”The counsel then asked, “And you can’t say you saw it on his person, you can’t say you saw him put it down in the kitchen, take it from the kitchen, or put it down anywhere in the basement. Those are all correct statements, are they not?”K.S. answered, “Yes. I cannot say.”Trying to salvage the state’s case, the Assistant Circuit Attorney later asked K.S., “Did you see what you believed to be a phone?”Here comes the shocker. K.S. answered, “… I haven’t talked about it because I don’t know if it’s because I’m remembering it through a dream or I – I’m not sure, but yes, I feel like I saw it after that happened, but I haven’t spoken about it because of that.”K.S. remembered the photo incident “through a dream”? Memories recovered through dreams have led to some of the great injustices in recent jurisprudence. To her credit, K.S. struggled to give honest answers to the questions she was asked, but her honesty has undone the remaining threads of a quickly unraveling case.As the defense counsel observed in the motion, the state was aware that recovered memories may have accounted for K.S.’s recollection, but state prosecutors failed to turn that obviously exculpatory evidence over to the defense. K.S. also failed to so share this revelation with the House committee investigating Greitens.Defense counsel insists that there is additional exculpatory evidence the prosecution has yet to turn over to the defense and has asked the court to order Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner to produce it.","Missouri Governor Eric Greitens has been facing multiple charges of computer tampering, invasion of privacy, and sexual misconduct. One of the most controversial aspects of the case has been the missing photo, which is believed to be evidence of the governor’s wrongdoing. The photo was taken in 2015, when Greitens was involved in an extramarital affair with his hairdresser. The allegations against Greitens suggest that he took a photo of his naked mistress without her consent and threatened to release it if she spoke about their affair. The photo was reportedly destroyed by the governor’s former campaign aide, who is now a key witness in the case. Despite the efforts of the defense team to discredit the witness and question the authenticity of the photo, the prosecution maintains that the evidence is strong enough to secure a conviction. The trial is expected to continue for several more weeks, with the fate of Greitens’ political career hanging in the balance."
politifact14155,1,0,"HERE Is WHAT WILL HAPPEN If The DEEP STATE TAKES DOWN PRESIDENT TRUMP & It’s NOT PRETTY … FOR THEM“The tree of liberty must be refreshed with the blood of patriots and tyrants.” – Thomas JeffersonELDER PATRIOT – Corrupt politicians ignore Jefferson’s directive to their own detriment. It’s no longer political, it’s personal.Americans have had their eyes opened by the ascension of Donald Trump and no amount of leftwing money can put the Freedom Movement genie back in the bottle.Conservative Senator Ted Cruz made that observation after reviewing the results of the 2016 elections and the expectations of the voters.Cruz, who had the most high profile personality clash with Donald Trump during the Republican primary process nevertheless embraced Trump’s America First agenda and said, “If we’re given the White House and both houses of Congress and we don’t deliver, I think there will be pitchforks and torches in the streets. And I think quite rightly.”Candidate Trump promised many things – border control, lower taxes, fairer trade relations, a balanced budget, healthcare that puts the people first not the government, safer communities, and – to the extent possible – an end to foreign wars. What, among those promises, should any Republican, nay any American, have a problem with?After four months without a single legislative achievement, Congressional and Senatorial Republicans – notably John McCain, Paul Ryan and Lindsey Graham – have joined the Democrats in investigating President Trump absent a single shred of evidence that an underlying crime has been committed.So, what gives?Well, there was one additional promise that Trump made on his way to the White House that has some Republicans joining with Democrats and quaking in their boots, Trump’s promise to “Drain the Swamp.”As we reported yesterday, “An F.B.I. agent with ‘intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the Clinton case’ told us that they uncovered evidence of such massive corruption that the agents involved realized that damned near the entire government could be brought down.”The criminal co-conspirators in both parties realized almost immediately that the new sheriff wasn’t interested in joining them in the swamp so they launched, what can only be characterized as, a coup attempt.Democrats are well schooled in such things probably because of their close alliance with Marxist regimes that can only gain power by seizing it through bloody civil wars. It should be noted that the Democratic Party has already done this once before.One Hundred and Fifty-Seven years ago the Democrats waged a war against the First Republican President Abraham Lincoln for giving Blacks their freedom. That war came at a high price, as many as 700,000 Americans died fighting for what they believe in. To put that in perspective, these casualties exceed the nation’s loss in all its other wars, from the Revolution through Vietnam.Today, Americans are still prepared to fight and die to protect their children’s God-given freedoms. Despite what you are reading and hearing in the mainstream media, they aren’t the leftwing-funded rioters, the pussy hat-wearing feminists, or the cuck bois that cant handle a micro aggression. No, the Americans that back Donald Trump are well armed.Donald Trump’s presidency will move forward politically lest the sixty million patriots who voted for him, that are comprised of the large majority of military voters, police, and NRA members, move it forward by force.These patriots are armed, trained, prepared, and have proven their discipline. They have grown disgusted by the corruption in Washington and will do whatever is necessary to make sure Trump’s Freedom Agenda moves forward and under the direction of Donald Trump himself.No amount of fake news based on unsubstantiated charges by unnamed sources is going to change that. The battle lines have been drawn and no amount of finger pointing is going to convince these patriots to let anyone overturn the election results.So why a","-Thomas Jefferson. 

In a shocking turn of events, the Deep State has reportedly taken down President Trump. The news has sent shockwaves throughout the country, with many expressing their outrage and disbelief.

According to sources close to the situation, the Deep State had been planning this move for months, if not years. They saw President Trump as a threat to their power and influence, and were determined to take him down at all costs.

The consequences of this action are sure to be severe. The country is already on edge, with tensions running high between those who support the President and those who oppose him. This move by the Deep State is only likely to further inflame these tensions, leading to widespread unrest and even violence.

Moreover, the ramifications for the country as a whole are likely to be severe. The stability of the government is at risk, and the future of the country hangs in the balance. The Deep State's actions have put the entire nation in peril, and it is unclear what the future holds.

In the face of this crisis, it is important for all Americans to remain calm and vigilant. We must stand together and work towards a peaceful resolution, rather than letting our differences divide us. Only by coming together can we hope to overcome this dark period in our nation's history and move forward towards a brighter future."
politifact14893,1,0,"President Donald Trump has only been in office for a short time and he’s already caused so much anxiety to the country, including the intelligence community. Instead of continuing to be a punching bag though, one intelligence agency decided to fight back and they just sent Trump a message: they are watching him. In a twist right out of a Hollywood film, six White House staffers were escorted out of the White House for failing their background investigations. Here’s what WJ just reported:“The staffers were escorted from the White house Wednesday for problems with their SF86 application, the ‘Questionnaire for National Security Positions.’ The 127-page document includes questions on the applicant’s credit score, medical records, employment history, family history, substance use and other personal subjects.”The six staffers included the daughter of President Trump’s Florida campaign manager Caroline Wiles:“Wiles, who resigned Friday before the background check was completed, was appointed deputy assistant secretary before the inauguration in January. She will instead get a job at the Treasury Department, sources told Politico.”The form, called the SF86, is for anyone who is applying for a sensitive position in the U.S government. Depending on the level of clearance and the agency requesting it, information collected can go all the way back to the age of 18 and in some instances, a polygraph exam is required. Both the FBI and the CIA require polygraph exams for top secret positions.It’s striking that Trump had already employed individuals who had not yet passed background investigations. It shouldn’t be surprising then that intelligence agencies are refusing to share information with his administration:“Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, said in an interview with The Journal that the intelligence community considered protecting its sources and the people cultivating them to be ‘their most sacred obligation.’ Schiff added, referring to Trump: ‘I’m sure there are people in the community who feel they don’t know where he’s coming from on Russia.'”Just as was the case with Michael Flynn who just recently resigned over his shady ties to Russia, you can bet that this administration is being closely watched.Featured Photo by Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images","According to multiple sources within the intelligence community, President Trump's erratic behavior and unpredictable decision-making have caused widespread anxiety and concern among intelligence officials. These sources have reported that Trump's frequent criticism of the intelligence community and his dismissive attitude towards their work have created a toxic and unstable environment that is threatening to undermine the integrity of the nation's intelligence operations.

In addition, Trump's reported ties to Russia and his controversial policies on immigration and trade have further fueled the anxiety and uncertainty that is gripping the country. Many intelligence officials fear that Trump's actions and decisions could have serious national security implications, and they are reportedly working to mitigate the damage that could result from his unpredictable leadership.

Overall, Trump's short tenure in office has already had a profound impact on the country, and the intelligence community is just one of the many institutions that are feeling the effects of his unorthodox and often chaotic approach to governing. As tensions continue to mount and the stakes continue to rise, it remains to be seen how Trump's presidency will ultimately play out, but one thing is certain: the future of the nation hangs in the balance."

politifact15109,1,0,"Michelle Obama has been mostly laying low on one vacation after another since leaving the White House, only to emerge when she sees an opportunity to publicly slam President Donald Trump. A lot of questions have come up about the former first lady, starting when Barack Obama was still the president and continuing on now as the two live very separate lives. Although she’s desperately tried to hide the truth for months, a doctor has recently revealed what she has diagnosed her with which confirms our suspicions as well as our fears.Many have felt that Michelle’s behavior in the final months of being the first lady was strange, even for her, and has only gotten more alarming since the arrogant woman left the White House, but perpetually tries to remain as the center of everyone’s attention. Much of the country is happy to have her and her husband out of politics and wish that she’d slip into obscurity, but she refuses. Now we know why.Michelle’s hate for America seemed to become more obvious as the grip of power she had while her husband was president started to slip away at the end of his second term as their eviction dated neared. Every chance she got to make disparaging remarks about the country, she took, which has been a habit that’s only gotten worse in her post-presidential life. Dr. Lauren A. Wright, PhD, who is director of investor relations at NV5 Global, Inc. and a member of the White House Transition Project, shed some light on why Michelle did this as result of what she unofficially diagnosed her with.Biz Pac Review reported on the issue at the end of Obama’s administration before Trump took office:Why is First Lady Michelle Obama suddenly appearing so many places disparaging the country in the last days of her husband’s presidency?Dr. Lauren A. Wright, PhD, who is director of investor relations at NV5 Global, Inc. and a member of the White House Transition Project, recently wrote a book entitled, “On Behalf of the President: Presidential Spouses and White House Communications Strategy Today.”Wright diagnosed Mrs. Obama’s recent behavior. She has become an attack dog in an effort to help Obama build his legacy as the last days of his presidency slip away.“She’s in legacy building mode. She doesn’t have to worry about the implications [of her remarks] for months to come,” Wright said. “This is the time she’s most free to say what she feels, what she believes, and what she wants the message to be for the public.”As First Lady, Obama has given more public speeches and indulged more appearances than any First Lady in history, Wright reported in her book.“I think what surprises and upsets people most often is that first ladies give more public remarks than vice presidents, and that’s been true over the last three administrations,” she wrote.Of her biggest, and most disturbing claims she made in her campaign of hate against the country was that America is a racist nation who needed her husband in office and that she’s now suffering a feeling of “hopelessness” with Trump in office. Doubling down on that disrespectful sentiment is that she said she was never proud of America until her husband got elected to the White House. It’s ironic how Michelle says Barrack was successful in inspiring hope in the nation after everyone overwhelmingly voted Trump in, desperate for the hope his predecessor promised and failed to deliver on.The best case of revenge was how miserably she failed at building her legacy and trying to save it in the final days, especially now, that Trump just took the final sledgehammer to her most beloved project.

However, it seems that she can't resist the urge to take a swipe at the current administration, particularly President Donald Trump.

Recently, Michelle Obama emerged from her vacation to attend a fundraiser for the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, where she delivered a scathing speech criticizing the President and his policies. She accused him of creating a ""politics of fear"" and called on Americans to stand up against his divisive rhetoric.

This is not the first time that Michelle Obama has used her platform to criticize the President. In the past, she has spoken out against his immigration policies, his handling of the Charlottesville rally, and his attacks on the media. Her comments have sparked both praise and backlash from supporters and detractors alike.

Despite her public criticisms, Michelle Obama remains a beloved figure among Democrats and a powerful voice in the party. Her speech at the fundraiser was met with a standing ovation, and many see her as a potential candidate for political office in the future.

As for her vacation habits, Michelle Obama has been spotted on luxury cruises, relaxing on exotic beaches, and even visiting some of the world's most famous landmarks. However, it seems that she can't resist the urge to speak out when she sees an opportunity to push back against the current administration's policies."

The voice in question is none other than Angela Davis, the renowned scholar and activist who has dedicated her life to fighting for racial and social justice. In a statement released on Saturday, Davis denounced the violent tactics of Antifa and urged all those who are committed to fighting for a better world to do so peacefully and non-violently.

Davis's statement came in response to the recent wave of protests that have taken place across the country, with Antifa groups calling for the removal of Trump and his supporters from power. While Davis acknowledges the seriousness of the issues facing our society, she believes that violence is not the answer. Instead, she argues that we must work to build a broad-based movement that can bring about real change and create a more just and equitable world for all.

In her statement, Davis also took aim at the media for its portrayal of Antifa as a group of violent extremists. She notes that while some members of the group may engage in acts of property destruction or other forms of violence, the vast majority of Antifa activists are peaceful and committed to non-violent resistance. Davis calls on the media to do a better job of covering the issues at hand and to avoid perpetuating stereotypes and misinformation that can only serve to further divide our already deeply polarized society.

Davis's statement has already sparked a heated debate within the civil rights community, with some praising her for speaking out against violence and others criticizing her for failing to condemn Trump and his policies outright. Regardless of one's position on the issue, however, it is clear that Davis's voice carries a great deal of weight and influence within the movement for racial and social justice. Her call for peaceful resistance and non-violent activism is a reminder that even in the face of great adversity, we must always strive to remain true to our values and to work towards a better future for all."

In a statement released by the Post, Baron emphasized that the newspaper has never conducted a survey about President Trump and has no plans to do so in the future. He further stated that the Post has reported the incident to the authorities and is working closely with them to investigate the matter.

The news of the fraudulent calls has raised concerns about the safety and privacy of residents in Alabama. It is unclear at this time how many people may have been targeted by the individual making the calls or what their motives may be.

The Washington Post has assured the public that they are taking all necessary steps to prevent any further incidents of this nature. They have encouraged anyone who receives a similar call to report it to the authorities immediately."

The boy's symptoms have raised concerns about the safety of the produce sold at Walmart, which has faced criticism in the past over its labor practices and treatment of workers.

The incident occurred on Friday when the boy's mother bought a bunch of bananas at the Walmart store. Within a week, the boy began experiencing severe symptoms that led his mother to rush him to the emergency room. The boy's condition is said to be stable at present, but his symptoms have raised concerns about the safety of the produce sold at Walmart.

Walmart has issued a statement expressing concern over the incident and promising to cooperate fully with any investigation into the matter.

The incident has once again highlighted the importance of food safety and the need for strict regulations to ensure that the produce sold in stores is safe for consumption. It has also raised questions about the labor practices of companies like Walmart, which has faced criticism in the past for its treatment of workers.

She has also called for more transparency in the food industry and for companies to prioritize the safety of their products over profits.

While the exact cause of the boy's symptoms is not yet known, it is clear that more needs to be done to ensure that the food we eat is safe and free from harmful contaminants."

Strzok’s lawyer, Aitan Goelman, said in a letter to Goodlatte released Sunday that the move would be unnecessary, as Strzok “intends to voluntarily appear and testify before your committee and any other Congressional committee that invites him.”The letter noted that Strzok cooperated fully with the DOJ inspector general, who issued a report last week that was highly critical of the agent. In the lead-up to the 2016 election Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who were having an affair, exchanged anti-Trump messages on their FBI-issued phones. In one, Page asked if Trump might become president and Strzok replied, “No. No he won’t. We’ll stop it.” The inspector general found no evidence connecting their views with “specific investigative decisions,” but said that comment and others “implies a willingness to take official action.”Strzok and Page said he meant Trump wouldn’t be elected, and noted that they did not do anything to hurt Trump’s odds, like leaking the existence of the Russia probe before the election. Goelman told the Washington Post on Sunday that there’s “no question” that Strzok regrets sending the messages, but that “I think what he was doing is expressing his political opinions in what he thought was a private text conversation, and he regrets that this has been weaponized by people with political motivations to try to discredit the Mueller investigation.”Mueller removed Strzok from his investigation several weeks after it started following the discovery of the texts.Goelman said that if asked to testify, Strzok would be willing to testify without immunity, and would not invoke his Fifth Amendment rights. He said the agent “intends to answer any question put to him, and he intends to defend the integrity of the Clinton email investigation, the Russia collusion investigation to the extent that that’s a topic, and his own integrity.”Trump reiterated his thoughts on the matter on Sunday night, which are not supported by the inspector general’s findings. The report did not cover the Russia probe, though that did not stop Trump’s allies from calling for Mueller’s immediate suspension.Why was the FBI’s sick loser, Peter Strzok, working on the totally discredited Mueller team of 13 Angry & Conflicted Democrats, when Strzok was giving Crooked Hillary a free pass yet telling his lover, lawyer Lisa Page, that “we’ll stop” Trump from becoming President? Witch Hunt! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2018“The highest level of bias I’ve ever witnessed in any law enforcement officer.” Trey Gowdy on the FBI’s own, Peter Strzok. Also remember that they all worked for Slippery James Comey and that Comey is best friends with Robert Mueller. A really sick deal, isn’t it? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2018Strzok still works for the FBI, but it’s unclear what he does now. The inspector general referred him, Page, and three other people to the FBI office that handles disciplinary action.","The former head of the FBI's counterintelligence division has made a surprising decision to cooperate with lawmakers. Peter Strzok, who was involved in the investigations into Hillary Clinton's emails and Russia's involvement in the Trump campaign, has announced that he is willing to testify before the House Judiciary Committee or any other committee that wishes to hear from him.

This move has come as a surprise to many, given Strzok's past defiance of Congressional oversight and his previous refusal to answer questions about the investigations he was involved in. His decision to cooperate may be seen as an attempt to clear his name and address concerns about his impartiality during the investigations.

Strzok's testimony could provide valuable insight into the FBI's handling of the investigations and could potentially shed light on any political bias that may have influenced the outcomes. However, it is also possible that his testimony could further polarize the political climate and lead to further investigations and scrutiny.

Regardless, Strzok's willingness to testify is a significant development in the ongoing saga of political investigations and could have far-reaching implications for the future of the FBI and the investigations that it conducts."

They could never have known that a drunk 24-year-old, Marin Heidgen, was also on the road. Heidgen, driving on the wrong side of the road, hit the limo head-on, causing a devastating accident.Police reports revealed that Heidgen’s blood alcohol level was more than three times the legal limit. He had consumed at least 14 drinks and had been driving at 70 miles an hour, on the wrong side of the highway, for at least two miles before the catastrophic accident occurred.The driver of the limousine, 59-year-old Stanley Rabinowitz, was killed instantly after being crushed by the engine. The bride’s father, Christopher, broke both of his legs in several places after being thrown to the floor. He later had to have one amputated. His wife, Denise, was also seriously injured, and little Grace was stuck in the folds of the wreckage.Despite having a broken back, Neil attempted to crawl from the car to seek help. Meanwhile, Jennifer, who had injured her foot, was desperately searching for Katie, who had been lying on the side seat at the time of the crash.Then, Jennifer Flynn came across something that no mother should ever have to witness – her daughter, Katie, had been decapitated by her own seat-belt.One of the first responders on the scene was Michael Tangney, the bride’s uncle and a policeman himself. He had been at the wedding just hours before:“I was walking to the rear of the limousine when a gentleman was coming away from it, and he said, ‘Don’t go back there. It’s bad,’” Michael Tangney said. “I opened the rear door to the limousine and realized it was my family.”But, tragically, the worst was yet to come.Michael Tagney would witness Jennifer emerging from the wreck with her daughter’s head in her hands. Katie’s body remained in the car, still in the dress she had proudly worn for the wedding only a few hours previous.For the next hour, Jennifer sat next to the road. She kept Katie’s head on her lap and watched as the rest of her family was freed from the wreckage of the destroyed vehicle.Eventually, she let her daughter go; handing her to Michael. Before she did so, she kissed her daughter’s face one last time.The event altered the lives of the whole family. Martin Heidgen was sentenced to 18 years in prison for two counts of second-degree murder – though nothing, of course, can ever bring back Jennifer’s daughter.Jennifer and Neil have bravely chosen to talk openly about their story, in the hope that it might prevent a similar catastrophe from happening again.“Since no one should have to live the life I do, I felt a responsibility, an obligation, to stand up and tell our story,” Jennifer said.“I hope that by experiencing the devastation that we survived that night, and still continue to live through, people can see the seriousness of drunk driving as the crime it really is. Hopefully we will save more in the future.”The fact that people still drive drunk will come as no surprise to you.I’m sure y","'s wedding.

politifact15494,1,0,"A dispute in Angela Merkel’s coalition over migration policy has swiftly escalated into one of the biggest tests of her chancellorship.The clash has opened a rift at the heart of the German leader’s own camp, between her Christian Democratic Union and its CSU Bavarian sister party. How the conflict is resolved will determine the chancellor’s fate, possibly as soon as Monday.Horst Seehofer, Merkel’s interior minister and the leader of Bavaria’s Christian Social Union, wants to force through a plan to send back migrants who have already registered for asylum in other European Union states. Merkel rejects the proposal as offloading the burden on neighboring states, and says it would kill efforts to forge a bloc-wide response to the continent’s struggle with migration.Bavarian lawmakers are fully behind Seehofer, while Merkel has wrested a majority in the larger CDU group for her position. The standoff is a replay of tensions that have periodically bubbled up between Merkel and Seehofer since the height of the refugee crisis in 2015 and 2016, only this time there is no obvious way out. Following are some potential scenarios:CompromiseThe two parties have managed to eke out a compromise after each previous conflict. Overtures could begin on Monday, when the CSU party executive meets in Munich. Seehofer could give Merkel what she wants: two weeks to forge bilateral accords with countries such as Italy and Greece to return registered asylum seekers.Merkel could also give ground, as for example the newspaper Die Welt advocates. She could put forward another proposal to assuage the CSU that may yield a compromise. But if she caves in to the Bavarian demands as they stand, it would be an unprecedented loss of authority that would render her a lame duck leader.No CompromiseIn the absence of a face-saving deal, the real clash could come as early as Monday. That’s when Seehofer has indicated he will start to implement his plan at the border. As interior minister, Seehofer has the authority to do so, even in the face of Merkel’s rejection. The only way for the chancellor to forestall a unilateral decision by her minister would be to fire him. Sacking her top Bavarian ally would be a historic first. If it happens, it’s hard to see how the coalition continues.Even if it doesn’t come to that and Merkel is given until the June 28-29 EU summit to reach bilateral agreements, it may only delayed the clash, since there is no guarantee she can win deals with other other EU states. She has already called the prospect ambitious.Confidence voteFor a coalition to dissolve, the German constitution says the lower house of parliament, or Bundestag, has to call a vote of confidence. The CDU and CSU, with a combined 246 seats, and the SPD with 153, have a majority of 44 seats in the 709-seat Bundestag. Such a move would be the ultimate measure of support for Merkel as chancellor. Even if she is unable to rely on the CSU, or indeed all of her own party’s votes, on the specific issue of her stand on migration Merkel might be able to attract the support of the Greens, which have 67 seats.Germany’s Sueddeutsche Zeitung said in an opinion piece on Friday that Merkel should short-circuit the squabbling and put her parliamentary support to the test with a confidence vote. It’s a tactic that her predecessor, Social Democrat Gerhard Schroeder, used to force through military support for the U.S. after the Sept. 11 attacks. He used it again in 2005 amid a party rebellion, and this time lost the confidence motion, forcing new elections.Merkel resignsShould the chancellor view her authority as irretrievably compromised, she could throw in the towel. The Bundestag would be forced to elect a new chancellor to replace her, most likely from the CDU. Unless the governing parties agree to continue the coalition under a new leader, Germany’s ninth chancellor since World War II would serve in a caretaker capacity through to a new election.Split on the rightThe CDU and the CSU ar","The coalition government of German Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing a severe crisis as a dispute over migration policy has escalated into one of the biggest tests of her leadership. The controversy began with the Interior Minister, Horst Seehofer, who proposed a plan to turn away at the border asylum seekers who had already registered in other European countries. This plan was met with fierce opposition from Merkel and other members of the coalition. As the disagreement intensified, Merkel was forced to call a crisis meeting of the coalition parties, where she faced intense pressure to take a firm stance on the issue. The dispute has now escalated to the point where it threatens to bring down the entire government. The crisis has put Merkel's leadership skills and her ability to manage the complexities of German politics to the test."

Liberals were too quick to disperse this shocking picture, as proof of President Donald Trump’s cruelty. But their incredible blunder just backfired. Now, they’re screwed.The answer, naturally, is a resounding no. Democrats will do anything to undermine the president’s work. That includes being underhanded, manipulative, and cruel as possible.Within the course of Trump’s period in office, we have seen liberals do some shockingly dreadful things. They’ve insulted his wife by criticizing her intelligence, state of origin, as well as her accent, demonstrating who the real racists and sexists are.Liberals didn’t hesitate to question his children’s psychological health, even calling Barron handicapped. That is not even mentioning the numerous times that left handed outlets edited videos or photos to create Trump look like a poor guy.However, what they did that this weekend actually takes the cake. A photo went viral throughout Twitter. The dreadful picture depicted arrested illegal immigrants. These individuals — arrested by our government — were made to stay in cages resembling dog kennels.It is too bad that these liberals did not bother to check the date on the film.Ex-Obama staffer Jon Favreau, in a now-deleted conversation, linked to a AZCentral.com article titled,”First glance of immigrant kids at holding facility” and said”This is occurring right now, and the only argument that issue is the way we force our government to get these kids back to their families as quickly as possible”His obvious intent was to slam the Trump government for its treatment of unaccompanied minors taken into custody at the border. [Source: Twitchy]Jon Favreau was among many liberals who assaulted Trump within this injustice. The famous Hollywood actor and director once worked for Obama as his speechwriter. So I guess he understood how better things were under the last government, right? This liberal celebrity is likely horrified every day over what he sees coming from the White House. I mean, that could let something as bad as this:How dreadful! Certainly the guy responsible for this is a total racist, who hates brown people. Liberals have every right to spread this photograph to as many people as possible.But wait, let’s look at the initial post. It was from ACCentral.com. As stated by the date, this was composed in 2014.That’s right, liberals. This photograph you are so outraged more than was taken through Obama’s administration.Liberals were not storming Twitter with demands for change. They were not calling Obama racist for treating kids like this. Why weren’t the overlords inside the mainstream press requiring answers from his government?Appears like liberals didn’t care when Obama mistreated illegals. Yet they accuse Trump of racism, dependent on nothing. All Trump wants to do is protect our border from crime and terrorism.He is not treating illegals like creatures. However, while Trump calls vile MS-13 members”animals,” Obama was treating children like creatures. Really makes you think.Liberals, in their own feverish hatred for Trump, unwittingly outed among Obama’s numerous sins. And their own. They pretend to care, as a response to Trump’s stance on immigration.Before Trump suggested the wall, liberals did not think twice about illegals. We all know that for a fact since this article has been around for FOUR decades, and they have said nothing.Featured Image Source H/T: MadWorldNewsLike this: Like Loading...","However, a closer examination of the pictures reveals that the illegal immigrants were not confined in cages, but rather in a temporary facility that was overcrowded due to the high number of arrivals. This was confirmed by the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency, which said that the migrants were being held in a ""temporary holding cell"" while waiting to be processed.

The facility, which is located in El Paso, Texas, is not a permanent one, and the CBP said that it was not designed to hold migrants for an extended period. The agency added that the temporary facility was overcrowded because of the high number of migrants who have been arriving at the border recently.

The incident highlights the challenges that the Trump administration is facing in dealing with the surge of illegal immigrants at the border. The CBP said that it is doing its best to manage the situation, but it needs more resources to handle the influx of migrants. The agency also called on Congress to pass immigration reform laws that would help address the issue.

In the meantime, the viral photos have sparked a heated debate on social media, with some people accusing the Trump administration of being cruel and inhumane. However, others have defended the administration, saying that the government has a responsibility to secure the border and enforce immigration laws."

politifact15210,1,0,"320 SHARES Share TweetPresident Trump is about to end the longstanding abuse of the American welfare system and ban migrants from getting free money and handouts for five years. The immigration rules will prohibit migrants from coming to the country and taking advantage of free American welfare money right away. It will slow down, or stop, chain migration while protecting American workers and potentially saving taxpayers money.What used to happen is that people would migrate to America and just live on the free money they received. That’s called welfare abuse. America is open to migrants, but perhaps we don’t want migrants who can’t fend for themselves. Maybe it’s better if people who are self-sufficient migrate to the country so that we can reduce the amount of citizens living off the system.President Trump wants to introduce a merit-based Green card system in which migrants compete for Visas. Migrants can earn points for themselves by learning to speak English, gaining job training or job offers, or doing something else that is considered a benefit to the America. The idea seems to be that in order for America to grant Visas or citizenship, the migrant has to give something back to the country. It’s as though the government wants to stop people coming to America and living off the system and would prefer people coming to the country to be contributors. Do something for America and America will do something for you.Migrants to those countries must compete for a limited number of visas by gaining points for English proficiency, competitive training, a job offer or another major achievement that benefits the host country.The concept, which is modeled after similar programs from Australia and Canada, is taking harsh criticism from activists. It’s like they want an open border policy where everyone gets free welfare money, but that would just be the downfall of America. If we observe what’s happening in Germany, with Merkel’s “come on in” policy, then we see a mass increase in horrible crimes like gang rape. Do we want mass amounts of migrant gang rape in America? There’s already enough trouble with crime in sanctuary cities that protect illegal immigrant criminals. Those folks should be deported because of their bad behavior and often violent crimes they commit on American people and even other immigrants.If America prevents immigrants from getting free benefits for five years, then that makes people think twice about coming here. If a family who thinks about crossing the border to start a new life knows that they cannot live for free, then they may not come at all. If they have possible jobs lined up and will be almost instantly integrating successfully with society, then that’s a great match. America is the land of the free, but not the land of the free money.Migrants who enter the United States cannot receive welfare during their first five years in the country, President Trump revealed from his upcoming immigration overhaul.“Just this week, we announced a historic immigration bill to create a merit-based Green Card system that ends the abuse of our welfare system, stops chain migration, and protects our workers and our economy,” he stated on his weekly radio address. “As an example, you cannot get welfare for five years when you come into our country.”“You cannot just come in like in past weeks, years, and decades, you come in immediately and start picking up welfare. For five years, you have to say you will not be asking or using our welfare systems.”Compare that to Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel opened the border to millions of unvetted migrants who can’t speak German and lack employable skills, which dooms them to perpetual welfare paid by German taxpayers – and boredom that manifests into terrorist attacks against, once again, German taxpayers.Last year the German government admitted that only 2.8% of over 1.2 million migrants had gotten a job – but even then those statistics might be exaggerated, according to j","In a surprise announcement made on Monday, President Donald Trump revealed his plan to reform the American welfare system, which he described as ""outdated and abused."" The President's proposal would prohibit migrants from receiving any form of government assistance, including food stamps and housing aid, for a period of five years after their arrival in the United States.

The move is seen as a direct response to the increasing number of immigrants who have been taking advantage of the welfare system to support themselves while they wait for their visa and green card applications to be processed. The President argued that the current system is unfair to American citizens, who have to work hard to make ends meet while others are able to live off the government.

The proposed reforms have already sparked controversy, with critics arguing that it will leave vulnerable immigrants without the support they need to survive. However, the White House has defended the move, arguing that it is necessary to ensure that the welfare system is not being exploited by those who are not entitled to it.

The President is expected to formally announce the reforms in his State of the Union address next week, and it remains to be seen how they will be received by Congress and the American public."

The event followed the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, which was described by many media outlets as a possible tipping point for gun control legislation.Never Again MSD (MSD refers to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School) is a group started on social media as a movement “For survivors of the Stoneman Douglas Shooting, by survivors of the Stoneman Douglas Shooting” using the hashtag #NeverAgain.The MSD student survivors who formed Never Again MSD include the now-famous David Hogg, Emma Gonzalez, and Cameron Kasky.Public demonstrations, especially those that are large-scale like March For Our Lives, require a permit from the police department of the city in which the demonstration will take place.A source of European researcher Ole Dammegard contacted the Metropolitan D.C.

politifact15564,1,0,"WASHINGTON, D.C.—Still reeling from Trump’s previous Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, Democrats plan to scrutinize any new nominee to ensure that he or she isn’t yet another crony of something called “The Constitution,” Senate Democrats announced Friday.“Time and time again, we find progressive laws getting struck down,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a Senate address. “And it’s always — always — the ones the Constitution is against. These right-wing judges don’t think for themselves, they just do whatever the Constitution says. And it’s time for that to end.”Senate Democrats have vowed to make sure that any new nominee isn’t going to be beholden to outside influences like the Constitution, the founding fathers, or the rule of law. “We need judges to be advocates of progressive laws,” Senator Elizabeth Warren added. “Not people who will bow to the whims of the Constitution, pitting its extremist values of freedom of speech and freedom of religion against our agenda.”“We’re sick and tired of the Constitution sitting in the National Archives, manipulating everything we do,” stated Senator Cory Booker, trying to emote for the cameras but failing. Booker then called a ten-minute recess for him to refresh his supply of fake tears before he could continue.Asked about their concerns, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he “doesn’t care” and plans to “completely ignore” the Democrats in the nomination process since “there’s nothing they can do” and he is “literally unstoppable.”","Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) stated that “the American people deserve a Supreme Court that is above partisan politics and truly represents the will of the people. Unfortunately, the last nominee, Neil Gorsuch, turned out to be a crony of ‘The Constitution.’ We cannot afford to make the same mistake again. Therefore, we will be closely examining any new nominee to ensure that they will be independent and impartial, and will not be swayed by the whims of ‘The Constitution.’”

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) dismissed Schumer’s concerns as “nothing but political posturing.” McConnell added that “the American people expect us to do our job and to confirm a nominee who is qualified and will uphold the Constitution. We will do just that, and we will not be intimidated by the Democrats’ baseless attacks.”

However, many legal experts believe that Schumer’s concerns are not without merit. “The Constitution has been used for far too long as a tool for partisan politics,” said constitutional law professor at Harvard Law School, Martha Minow. “It’s time for the Supreme Court to be more than just a political institution. We need to ensure that the Court truly represents the will of the people, and that means choosing a nominee who is not beholden to any political ideology, including ‘The Constitution.’”

The political battle over the next Supreme Court nominee is expected to be intense, with both parties digging in their heels and refusing to compromise. The confirmation process is likely to be contentious, with protests and demonstrations erupting on the streets of Washington, D.C. and across the country."

Now, though, the 41-year-old actor says he’s going to travel to Mars — but for real.Well, at least that’s what he told President Barack Obama.DiCaprio was at the White House on Monday night as part of the South by South Lawn event. The actor, the president, and climate scientist Dr. Katharine Hayhoe took the stage towards the end of the evening for a conversation on climate change before the U.S. premiere of DiCaprio’s new documentary on the subject, Before the Flood.The subject of Mars and SpaceX came up while Hayhoe was talking about the need to make people connect with the reality of climate change on a universal, human level. “The most important thing to do is not to pile up scientific reports until they reach a tottering pile of about 8 feet where they tip over and crush somebody,” Hayhoe said, explaining that what really matters when trying to motivate people to combat climate change thing is to connect its real meaning and impact to “what’s in our hearts.”“The reality of it is, if you’re a human living on this planet — which most of us are, yeah?” she joked. “As long as we haven’t signed up for the trip to Mars. I don’t want to know if anyone has, I think you’re crazy.”Article continues below Get a weekly round-up of the most essential Elon Musk news sent to your inbox.

Remember, though, Leo finally won an Oscar for his role in The Revenant, in part due to the brutal conditions he endured while filming it. Maybe, just maybe, he figured the only place tougher than frozen uncharted western territories is the Martian surface. The Academy would love it.It’s probably method acting, is what we’re saying.Earlier in the night, Obama made a Star Trek reference while talking about the importance of flawed but useful energy sources like fracking and nuclear power. “Until we invent the perfect energy source — Lithium crystals or whatever, Scotty’s there beaming us up — but until then we need to live in the real world,” Obama said.","Breaking News: Leonardo DiCaprio, the award-winning actor, has announced his plans to embark on a mission to Mars. This will be the first time in history that a celebrity of his caliber will be making such a trip. DiCaprio made the announcement during a press conference where he spoke about his love for space exploration and his desire to push the boundaries of human knowledge. The 41-year-old actor has had a long-standing fascination with space and has often spoken about the need to protect the planet. His new mission to Mars will be a significant step towards that goal. DiCaprio will be working with a team of experts to make the trip a reality. The team is currently in the process of designing a spacecraft that will be capable of sustaining human life for the duration of the journey. The mission to Mars is expected to take several years to complete, and DiCaprio is determined to make it happen. This will undoubtedly be a major milestone in the history of space exploration, and DiCaprio's contribution to the field will be remembered for generations to come."

politifact15505,1,1,"Hillary Clinton’s State Department gifted an “unknown number” of children to human traffickers after refusing to run the most basic checks on these so-called “caregivers,” according to a bombshell Senate report released late on Thursday and completely covered up by mainstream media.These children were then sexually abused, starved, and forced into child labor, according to the Senate report. Disturbingly, the fate of many of these children, mostly migrants, remains unknown.NY Mag reports: Local law enforcement uncovered the operation last year, prompting the Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations to open an inquiry into the federal government’s handling of migrants.“It is intolerable that human trafficking — modern-day slavery — could occur in our own backyard,” Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio and the chairman of the subcommittee, told the New York Times. “But what makes the Marion cases even more alarming is that a U.S. government agency was responsible for delivering some of the victims into the hands of their abusers.”As detention centers became incapable of housing the massive influx of migrants, the Department of Health and Human Services started placing children into the care of sponsors who would oversee the minors until their bids for refugee status could be reviewed. But in many cases, officials failed to confirm whether the adults volunteering for this task were actually relatives or good Samaritans — and not unscrupulous egg farmers or child molesters.The department performed check-in visits at caretakers’ homes in only 5 percent of cases between 2013 and 2015, according to the report.The Senate’s investigation built on an Associated Press report that found more than two dozen unaccompanied children were placed in homes where they were sexually abused, starved, or forced into slave labor. HHS claimed that it lacked the funds and authorities that a more rigorous screening process would have required.However, the investigation also found that HHS did not spend all of the money allocated to it for handling the crisis.The agency placed 90,000 migrant children into sponsor care between 2013 and 2015. Exactly how many of those fell prey to traffickers is unknown, because the agency does not keep track.","According to a shocking report by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Hillary Clinton's State Department failed to conduct proper background checks on individuals and organizations that were involved in the adoption of children from Haiti after the devastating earthquake in 2010. This resulted in an unknown number of children being trafficked and placed in situations of slavery and exploitation.

The report, which was released late last week, reveals that the State Department had received warnings from multiple sources about the possibility of trafficking rings taking advantage of the chaos in Haiti following the earthquake. Despite these warnings, the State Department failed to take action and instead expedited the adoption process for many of the children who were subsequently trafficked.

The report states that many of the children who were adopted ended up in situations of slavery and exploitation, including forced labor and sex trafficking. The report also notes that many of the individuals and organizations involved in the adoption process had criminal histories, but this information was not properly vetted by the State Department.

The Senate report has been met with silence by the mainstream media, despite the serious implications of the findings. It is unclear why the media has chosen to ignore this report, but it is clear that the American people have a right to know about the actions of their government and the potential consequences of those actions."
politifact14621,1,0,"The federal government grants some businesses the ability to pay reduced or no taxes because they are set up as a “non-profit.” The NFL is one of those businesses – or was, until Sunday evening when Donald Trump quietly signed an executive order removing the sports league’s non-profit status.The order notes the un-American attitude displayed by the players, who repeatedly kneel during the National Anthem, burn flags in their locker rooms, and disrespect our country in every way imaginable.To date, little has been done to stop players from disrespecting our military, our flag, and all they stand for, so President Trump “temporarily” revoked their 401(c)(3) status “until it is clear that players and team owners respect their country.”The NFL will be classified as a for-profit entity for tax purposes for the 2017 fiscal year, but the order allows the league to re-apply for tax-exempt status in January 2018 “if all of the problems are solved.”The White House spokeswoman told Breitbart News that the President hopes to see all the “athletes protesting our police and our flag or otherwise using their positions to spread hate” fired and replaced with people who “love and respect America.”[adrotate banner=""3""]The NFL has thus far refused comment.","The federal government has been granting certain businesses the privilege to pay reduced or no taxes by designating them as non-profit organizations. This move has been widely criticized by taxpayers and advocacy groups who claim that it is unfair and creates an uneven playing field in the business world. According to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), a non-profit organization is an entity that operates for the benefit of the public, rather than for the purpose of making a profit. The IRS requires that non-profit organizations use their income to further their mission, rather than distributing it to shareholders or owners.

One of the main arguments against non-profit status is that it allows organizations to avoid paying taxes that would otherwise be used to fund government services. Critics argue that this creates a situation where non-profit organizations are receiving benefits from the government, while not contributing to the government's revenue stream. This is particularly controversial in light of recent government cuts to social programs and the elimination of certain tax credits.

Despite the criticism, there are many legitimate reasons for an organization to seek non-profit status. For example, non-profit organizations are often exempt from property taxes, which can be a significant savings for organizations that own large amounts of property. Non-profit organizations are also eligible for grants and donations, which can help them to fund their operations and achieve their mission. Additionally, non-profit organizations are often able to attract talented employees who are motivated by the organization's mission, rather than by the prospect of high salaries or bonuses.

In conclusion, while the federal government's policy of granting non-profit status to certain businesses has been controversial, it is important to recognize that there are also legitimate reasons for organizations to seek this designation. The government should continue to review its policies to ensure that non-profit organizations are using their tax-exempt status in a way that benefits the public, rather than creating an unfair advantage in the business world."

However, in August of 2010, it was Waters who was under legal scrutiny for her behavior as a government official. Waters was charged with three counts of violating House rules and the federal ethics code.According to The Hill’s report from 2010:The House ethics committee on Monday outlined its charges against Rep. Maxine Waters, who is accused of helping a bank in which her husband owned stock secure federal bailout funds. The committee charged the 10-term California Democrat with three counts of violating House rules and the federal ethics code in connection with her effort to arrange a 2008 meeting between Treasury officials and representatives with OneUnited bank. The panel said Waters, who sits on the Financial Services Committee, broke a House rule requiring members to behave in a way that reflects “creditably” on the chamber. The committee said that by trying to assist OneUnited, she stood to benefit directly, because her husband owned a sizable amount of stock that would have been “worthless” if the bank failed. The committee also accused Waters of violating the “spirit” of a House rule prohibiting lawmakers from using their positions for financial gain, as well as a government ethics statute banning the dispensing of “special favors.”The charges were delayed and stalled by members of the committee, and multiple attorneys in the case were fired. Ultimately, Waters was absolved of the charges.According to National Review:[Waters] walked away with a slap on the wrist from the toothless House Ethics Committee in 2012 after being charged with multiple ethics violations related to her meddling in minority-owned OneUnited Bank … As stockholders, they profited handsomely from their relationship with the bank. It was a mutually beneficial relationship. After Waters’s office personally intervened and lobbied the Treasury Department in 2008, OneUnited received $12 million in federal TARP bailout money — despite another government agency concluding that the bank operated “without effective underwriting standards” and engaged “in speculative investment practices. After the federal bailout of Fannie/Freddie, OneUnited’s stock in the government-sponsored enterprises plunged to a value estimated at less than $5 million. Only through Waters’s intervention was OneUnited able to secure an emergency meeting with the Treasury and then-Secretary Henry Paulson. Tom Fitton, Judicial Watch president, reported that Waters’s friend and fellow California Democratic congresswoman Zoe Lofgren helped delay Waters’s scheduled 2010 House ethics trial on the matter by stalling subpoenas and improperly firing two attorneys working on the investigation. Six of ten House Ethics panel members quit the case in 2012 over questions about their partiality. An outside investigator absolved Waters of any wrongdoing. In spite of getting off on the charges, Waters carries with her a terrible reputation for corruption. Please see this list for a rundown of all the numerous scandals and charges which have been brought against her. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington has listed her as one of the most corrupt members of Congress five times.

Events were included in this list because of the seriousness or frequency of reporting. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequencies or to establish a causal relationship to components of Tripedia vaccine.In this sense, it should be noted that:Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Concentrates (For Further Manufacturing Use) are produced by The Research Foundation for Microbial Diseases of Osaka University (BIKEN), Osaka, Japan, under United States (US) license, and are combined with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur Inc. Tripedia vaccine is filled, labeled, packaged, and released by Sanofi Pasteur Inc.What’s in Tripedia that probably can interfere with brain chemistry and neurology?According to the Tripedia’s package insert, some ingredients include: Bovine extract, formaldehyde used to inactivate microorganisms a couple of times, ammonium sulfate, aluminum potassium sulfate and two growth mediums: modified Mueller and Miller is one; the other is Stainer-Scholte medium.What is the content of these two growth mediums?Mueller and Miller medium, contains:Glucose, sodium chloride, sodium phosphate dibasic, monopotassium, phosphate, magnesium sulfate hydrate, ferrous sulfate heptahydrate, cysteine hydrochloride, tyrosine hydrochloride, uracil hydrochloride, Ca-pantothenate in ethanol, thiamine in ethanol, pyridoxine-hydrochloride in ethanol, riboflavin in ethanol, biotin in ethanol, sodium hydroxide, beef heart infusion (de- fatted beef heart and distilled water), casein [milk protein] solution.

The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has released compelling evidence on its website that suggests a potential link between the Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis (DTaP) vaccine and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The agency's online Biologics Blood Vaccines document reveals that a vaccine manufacturer has acknowledged on its package insert that ASD is listed as one of many adverse reactions that can occur following vaccination with their product.

The FDA's publication of this information has sparked a renewed debate among medical professionals, parents, and advocacy groups regarding the safety and efficacy of vaccines. While some argue that the link between the DTaP vaccine and ASD is tenuous at best, others believe that this evidence underscores the need for further research into the potential risks associated with vaccination.

Dr. Jane Smith, a pediatrician at XYZ Hospital, stated that she remains cautiously optimistic about the potential benefits of vaccination, but believes that more research is needed to fully understand the risks. ""As a doctor, my primary concern is the health and well-being of my patients,"" she said. ""I think it's important for parents to have all the information they need to make informed decisions about vaccination, and for the scientific community to continue investigating potential links between vaccines and ASD.""

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has maintained that the overwhelming scientific evidence supports the safety and efficacy of vaccines in preventing the spread of infectious diseases. However, the agency has also acknowledged that vaccines can cause side effects in some individuals, and that further research is needed to better understand these potential risks.

The FDA's publication of the vaccine manufacturer's admission comes at a time when public confidence in vaccines has been shaken by a growing number of parents who believe that their children have been injured by vaccines. Some of these parents have formed advocacy groups and are calling for greater transparency and accountability from vaccine manufacturers and regulatory agencies.

In response to the FDA's publication, the vaccine manufacturer in question has issued a statement denying any wrongdoing and insisting that their product is safe and effective. They claim that the adverse reactions listed on the package insert are a standard part of the FDA's approval process, and that they do not necessarily indicate a causal link between the vaccine and ASD.

Despite this denial, many parents and advocacy groups are calling for greater transparency and accountability from the vaccine industry. They argue that it is imperative that manufacturers be held responsible for any harm caused by their products, and that regulatory agencies such as the FDA be more transparent in their approval processes.

Overall, the FDA's publication of the vaccine manufacturer's admission has raised important questions about the safety and efficacy of vaccines, and underscores the need for continued research and dialogue on this critical public health issue."

Michigan DNR Marine Biologist Dr. Debra Polowotski arrived at Good Harbor Bay and confirmed the 21 foot-long giant squid to be a very rare fresh-water species of genus Architeuthis. “We thought they were already in Lake Erie, we had no idea they were in Lake Michigan. This is first time there’s been an actual specimen recovered, so this is very exciting”, she said. It is believed that a few of the squid escaped from the Cleveland Sea World complex during the great Northeast blackout of 2003 when they were very young, and somehow made it into Lake Erie. According to Dr. Polowotski, the squid were kept contained in Lake Erie, as the Detroit River is too narrow and shallow for the squid to swim upstream. “They are intimidated by closed-in spaces. They need a lot of room. You have to remember that this is a very big animal”, she said. Dr. Polotwotski also confirmed that the squid is a female and further examination of the corpse indicated that it had recently laid eggs. “Hopefully the walleye can keep the tiny-giant squid population under control, else there is some cause for concern”, said Dr. Polowotski. “Boaters and swimmers really need to exercise some caution”. The animal was discovered by Bob Ritchie and his sister Jill, both of Romeo. “We were just, you know, taking an evening walk along the beach, heading out to the sandbar when we stumbled across it”, said Bob. “We were singing, drinking whiskey out of the bottle, not thinking about tomorrow. But something like this really does make you stop and think”, he said.

politifact15298,1,0,"Denzel’s recent comments about the “Orwellian Police State” is so very apparent, given the FBI, DNC, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama scandal inside the administration’s treasonous activity in having the Clinton Foundation pay for a fake dossier, made by Christopher Steele and Fusion GPS, which they hoped would create false allegations which would concede Donald Trump’s Presidential victory. This fake dossier was then passed to James Comey at the FBI, who then issued FISA warrants to surveillance Donald Trump at the Trump Tower prior to the election, which later sparked Robert Mueller’s Special Counsel to investigate any Russian collusion in the 2016 Presidential Election. This, in a nutshell, exposes the spying and the treason that the DNC committed under the Obama administration to try to prevent Trump from succeeding, which is all stated in the Nunes Memo.Denzel affirmed, “If the Democrats had won the election, we never would have found out they were using false documents to get warrants to spy on American citizens and political opponents. We never would have known this. Think about it!”Denzel Washington, who has been nominated for Best Actor for the film ‘Roman J. Israel, Esq.’ (his 8th total Oscar nomination), didn’t pull any punches on the revelations of the released memo, stating: “They would have a tool they would use over and over again to circumvent the will of the people in future elections”.When a reporter then asked Denzel Washington if he felt the memo released by Congress on Friday was “reliable”, he responded, “Hell yeah, it’s reliable. We don’t need to know the nitty gritty to understand exactly what’s happened here”.“We know that a warrant to spy on the Trump team was issued based on media reports, and these media reports were based on information provided by an opposition research firm being paid by the DNC and Hillary Clinton.”“You guys can’t see what is wrong with this? You’re kidding me. Well I guess you are reporters. How many reporters was it that got caught colluding with the Clinton campaign?”Denzel Washington then later called out individual reporters and media outlets for never publishing anything negative about the Democrat Party, and subsequently hiding their scandals from any in-depth news output.Denzel continued, “I grew up a Democrat. I get it. I know a lot of people who hate Trump with a real passion. But you’ve got to understand that we dodged a bullet when Clinton lost. More than one bullet. We avoided the creation of an Orwellian Police State”.We couldn’t agree more, and we thank god for Donald Trump every day, which has been our sentiment all along here at Brainstain. We also wonder why the mainstream news media is now trying to downplay the severity of the memo, as if it didn’t constitute complete treason?The double standards are “oh so” apparent, and it’s good to see somebody high up in celebrity circles like Denzel Washington to be brave enough speak out on these pressing issues, and helping to expose the scandals of the Democrat Party.","Headline: Denzel Washington’s Concerns about the Orwellian Police State

Denzel Washington, the renowned actor and activist, has recently expressed his concerns about the state of the country’s police force. In a recent interview, he described the situation as “Orwellian,” drawing attention to the FBI, DNC, Hillary Clinton, and Barack Obama scandal.

According to Washington, the scandal involving the Clinton Foundation, Fusion GPS, and Christopher Steele is a clear indication of treasonous activity within the administration. The fake dossier, paid for by the Clinton Foundation, was created with the intention of concocting false allegations against Donald Trump, with the aim of denying him the presidency.

Washington’s comments come at a time when the country is grappling with issues of police brutality and misconduct. The actor, who has a history of using his platform to advocate for social justice, believes that the scandal highlights the need for greater accountability and transparency in the police force.

He has called on the government to take action to address these concerns, arguing that the situation cannot be allowed to continue. Washington’s comments have resonated with many, who see his concerns as a wake-up call for the nation.

In conclusion, Denzel Washington’s recent comments about the “Orwellian Police State” are a wake-up call for the country. His concerns about the Clinton Foundation, Fusion GPS, and Christopher Steele scandal, which involved treasonous activity within the administration, highlight the need for greater accountability and transparency in the police force. It is clear that the situation cannot be allowed to continue, and the government must take action to address these concerns."

The friend, who wishes to remain anonymous, claims that Bourdain had confided in him about the harassment and intimidation he had been facing, which had left him feeling scared and vulnerable.

The source alleges that the harassment began after Bourdain made controversial comments about Clinton during an interview with a news outlet in early June. The operatives, who were reportedly associated with Clinton’s presidential campaign, had allegedly sent threatening messages to Bourdain, warning him to retract his statements or face serious consequences.

Bourdain’s friend says that the chef was shaken by the ordeal and had expressed concerns about the safety of his family. Despite his fears, however, Bourdain had refused to back down and had even doubled down on his criticism of Clinton in subsequent interviews.

As the harassment continued to escalate, Bourdain had reportedly sought help from the authorities, but his requests were allegedly ignored or dismissed. The friend believes that this inaction may have contributed to Bourdain’s feelings of hopelessness and despair, which ultimately led to his tragic death.

While the official cause of death has been ruled a suicide, the friend of Bourdain maintains that there may be more to the story than meets the eye. He suggests that the harassment and intimidation may have played a role in Bourdain’s death, and that a full investigation is necessary to uncover the truth.

Breaking News:

In a stunning development, the capture of ISIS leader, Rasheed Muhammad, has been announced by the White House. The capture was made possible thanks to an executive order signed by President Donald Trump, which authorized a new strategy to target the terror group's leadership.

According to a statement released by the White House, Rasheed Muhammad was taken into custody by U.S. Special Operations Forces in a secret operation in Syria. The operation was carried out with the full cooperation of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), who played a critical role in leading the United States to Muhammad's location.

This is a major victory for the United States and its allies in the fight against ISIS. Rasheed Muhammad was one of the terror group's most senior leaders and was responsible for the planning and execution of numerous terrorist attacks in both Iraq and Syria. His capture is a significant blow to the group's ability to carry out future attacks.

The White House statement also thanked the SDF for their cooperation and assistance in the operation. The statement went on to say that the United States will continue to work with its partners to degrade and ultimately defeat ISIS.

Rasheed Muhammad's capture is a significant milestone in the fight against ISIS and shows that the United States is committed to using all available tools to protect American interests and prevent terrorist attacks."

There is only so much we can downsize by moving to a tiny home, so planning for storage space is an integral part of preparation for tiny living.VerticalityTiny houses for sale in Florida have tiny floor plans. There is only so much space to put things on the floor, and once bare necessities such as beds, kitchen elements etc. are taken care of, there is little space left to put all of our stuff. Verticality is key in these situations. Wall-mounted shelving is excellent for organizing your stuff and it doesn’t demand a single inch of your floor. They are also quite inexpensive and easy to install. Instead of having an entertainment center, it is now easy to mount your TV and speakers on the wall, leaving more space for things you can’t compromise with.Multi-functional FurnitureIn a tiny house, a bed doesn’t have the luxury to be just a bed. It needs to perform multiple functions, where storage is one of the most important ones. The same applies to coffee and night tables, sofas and kitchen elements. Beds can have drawers for your linens, or room for storage under their mattress. Instead of a regular coffee table, opt in for a cube design, where multiple storage drawers are integrated for all those small things you don’t have space for.Customized FurnitureSometimes it is difficult to furnish a tiny home, especially if it doesn’t use a standard floor plan. Customized furniture is a huge advantage in tiny homes, where space is at a premium. You can make sure that every single corner and nook of your house can be used in a functional way. The same applies to storage. A well-placed shelf or locker, can perform a very important function while not taking up much space or by utilizing and otherwise unused space.

Instead of a full-sized stove, opt in for a dual heat-plate design that will take up less space. A small refrigerator works fine, just like a large two-door model. Also shopping more frequently for fresh groceries will lead you to a healthier lifestyle and diet. A fold out dinning-table in the kitchen, saves you the space that you might need for a dining table. Tiny appliances and gadgets do tend to have a higher price than standard ones, but they provide so much more than function to tiny home dwellers.","The modern trend of living in smaller homes, condos and apartments has sparked a rise in demand for storage space solutions. With the average home size shrinking, people are finding themselves with less space for storage and are turning to external storage solutions such as self-storage facilities, which have become increasingly popular in recent years.

Self-storage facilities offer a range of storage options, including climate-controlled units, drive-up access, and secure units with keypad entry. They are convenient for people who need to store items temporarily, such as while moving or decluttering, or for those who need to store items long-term, such as seasonal items or sentimental items.

However, the popularity of self-storage facilities has also raised concerns about security. While many facilities have advanced security measures such as surveillance cameras and gated access, some have had incidents of theft or vandalism. Therefore, it is important for customers to research the security measures of a self-storage facility before renting a unit.

In summary, the trend of living in smaller homes has created a growing demand for external storage solutions, with self-storage facilities becoming increasingly popular. While convenient, customers should be aware of security concerns and take steps to ensure their stored items are safe and secure."

The articles have been met with backlash from some readers, who accuse the magazine of being biased and uninformed. However, supporters of the NR argue that the magazine is an important voice in the political discourse, providing a platform for conservative viewpoints that are often marginalized in mainstream media.

Founded in 1955 by William F. Buckley Jr., the NR has a long history of promoting conservative ideology and criticizing liberal policies. Over the years, the magazine has published articles by some of the most influential conservative thinkers and writers in the country, including Russell Kirk, Friedrich Hayek, and Milton Friedman.

Of the fatalities last month, 36 were Cleveland residents,” Fox 8 reported. Trump is well aware of the opioid epidemic that claimed 52,000 lives in 2015, which was the most amount of overdoses in a single year in U.S. History.

politifact15205,1,0,"athy Griffin went off the rails again in another classless display that shows why her career as a comedian hasn’t been as successful as other well-known people much more successful than her.This time Griffin made repulsive comments that have people wondering if she has transitioned to the other gender while she’s been quietly hiding in the backend of the spotlight. In other words, she once again made remarks that would go viral, putting her back in the spotlight, but it’s in such a negative way that most people had to shake their heads and say “eeeeewwwwwww” right after what she said to the Deputy White House Press Secretary Hogan Gidley.Gidley and Griffin were at the same event and Gidley was passing by the table she was sitting at. Griffin snapped at him by asking how he sleeps at night. Gidley replied that he sleeps well and said thanks. Then it seems like she said something else, and he asked if they were going to go at it right there on the spot, and that’s when Griffin went into the full nasty mode and talked with a repulsive next few words that had people questioning her behavior and gender at the same time.Here’s what happened in full detail courtesy of the Washington Blade: “The event is a celebration of the First Amendment. As a longtime LGBT rights advocate, a comedian and provocateur, Griffin has made a long and successful career out of exercising her First Amendment right to free speech. The stunt last year in which she posed with a mock severed head of Donald Trump — which needlessly led CNN to fire her from a longstanding New Year’s Eve hosting gig with Anderson Cooper — was a textbook case of satire, which is constitutionally protected speech.Thus, the decision to invite Griffin proved an easy and obvious one. (We also invited Stormy Daniels, but her attorney, Michael Avenatti, told me without irony that it would be too much of a “sideshow” for her to attend.)Trending: Sarah Sanders Just Revealed What She Asked God For After Being Publicly Humiliated At WH DinnerGriffin didn’t disappoint, bringing her quick wit and fearless, LGBT-centric sense of humor to the dinner table. I met her and her boyfriend, Randy Bick, on the red carpet and held her purse as she posed for photographers and granted a series of TV interviews. Inside the heavy purse was a stapler; it turns out she suffered a last-minute wardrobe malfunction leaving the hotel, breaking a strap on her gown. After it was repaired, she feared a repeat and asked to borrow the stapler, just in case.She proved a good sport throughout the night, posing for an endless stream of selfies with (mostly gay) fans who congratulated her on surviving the Trump machine’s attacks in the aftermath of the photo scandal. When asked how her famous mom Maggie is at age 96, Griffin replied, “drunk.”The only awkward moment came when Deputy White House Press Secretary Hogan Gidley tried to squeeze past our table. Griffin stopped him and said, “How do you sleep at night?” Gidley replied, “Very well, thank you.” When Griffin expressed doubt about that, Gidley asked, “Are we really going to do this?”That’s when things got interesting. Griffin, in her trademark style, retorted, “Yes we are, suck my d-ck! No, really, suck my d-ck!”There was some back-and-forth, then Gidley, who was holding a Tecate, announced he was off to enjoy his Mexican beer “before we build the wall and you can’t get these anymore.” That prompted a farewell “f-ck you” from Griffin, triggering nervous laughter around our table.”It sure sounds like they had a fun time exchanging comments before Kathy Griffin took it to the levels of a unprofessionalism, acting exactly like the person who couldn’t hold a job with the Squatty Potty.Even though she claims to be a comedian, there’s still a level of professionalism that people should exude when they’re not on stage. Griffin has been unable to differentiate that and consistently confuses real life for her stage life (or lack thereof).Griffin might have some fans, but she","Athy Griffin's recent behavior has raised concerns among her fans and the public alike. In a recent incident, she made offensive comments about a prominent political figure, which sparked outrage on social media. This is not the first time that Griffin has caused controversy with her actions, and her repeated missteps have led to speculation that her career as a comedian may not be as successful as other well-known personalities. Despite her attempts to apologize for her behavior, many have expressed skepticism about her sincerity and have called for her to be held accountable for her actions."

In the video, the rapper shoots a clown version of President Trump with a toy gun, but that’s not what got him in trouble.After the story went viral, a reporter from Breitbart caught up with Snoop Dogg and asked him if he believed violence was the answer. His response was chilling. He said:“No, man. I don’t like violence any more than the next guy, but I would hope that if this clown in the White House was about to start a war or somethin’ that someone would do what I did but with a real gun. I know I would and I would encourage anyone who could get close enough to do the same. That’s not violence…it’s survival of the species.”The reporter, Glen Dingusman, immediately contacted the Secret Service with his evidence of violent threats made against the president and Snoop Dogg, who was on his way into a restaurant for lunch when the exchange happened, never made it past his hot wing appetizer.According to the agency, he will be held as a military combatant without being charged until they can ascertain whether or not he’s a threat to the president.

In a shocking turn of events, rapper Snoop Dogg has found himself at the center of controversy over his latest music video, ""Lavender,"" which depicts him shooting a clown resembling President Donald Trump. The video has sparked outrage from both the left and the right, with many condemning the glorification of violence and calling for Snoop Dogg to be held accountable for his actions.

The video, which was released earlier this week, shows Snoop Dogg pointing a gun at the clown and pulling the trigger. While the rapper has defended the video as a form of protest against Trump's policies, many have criticized him for promoting violence and inciting a dangerous atmosphere of political divisiveness.

The controversy surrounding Snoop Dogg's video comes at a time when tensions are already high in the United States, with many on both sides of the political spectrum feeling deeply polarized and angry. The video has only served to further inflame these tensions, with many calling for Snoop Dogg to be held accountable for his actions and for the video to be taken down.

While it remains to be seen how the controversy will play out, one thing is clear: Snoop Dogg's latest video has sparked a heated debate about the role of art and protest in society, and the line between free speech and incitement to violence. As the country grapples with these issues, it will be interesting to see how this controversy unfolds and what impact it will have on the cultural and political landscape of the United States."

The Obama Administration originally said he was taking the properties in order to punish Russia for meddling in the 2016 election, but that was just a clever ruse to fool the sheeple. To make it look legitimate, he also sanctioned two Russian intelligence services and gave 35 government officials 72 hours to leave the United States.But that was not what any of this was really about.

Please check back for updates on this breaking scoop.","According to sources close to the situation, the new sanctions announced by the Trump Administration against Russia are not actually about anything Russia did or didn’t do, but are instead a way to punish Russian President Vladimir Putin for not being a good enough “friend” to the Obamas.
How Obama’s Ego and Jealousy of Russia’s Strength Led to Economic Sanctions
In the aftermath of the U.S. presidential election, former President Barack Obama sought to punish Russia for what he perceived as its interference in the election. However, instead of taking direct action against the Russian government, Obama decided to target the personal assets of President Vladimir Putin.
The new sanctions, announced by the Trump Administration, are not actually about anything Russia did or didn’t do, but are instead a way to punish Russian President Vladimir Putin for not being a good enough “friend” to the Obamas. According to sources close to the situation, Obama became jealous of Russia’s strength and resented the fact that Putin was not willing to kowtow to him.
In an attempt to get back at Putin, Obama ordered the U.S. Treasury Department to freeze the assets of several Russian oligarchs and officials who were close to Putin. The move was widely seen as a direct attack on Putin’s inner circle and an attempt to undermine his authority.
However, the sanctions were never fully implemented, as the Trump Administration took office and decided to review the policy. Trump, who has sought to improve relations with Russia, announced that the new sanctions would be lifted in exchange for Putin agreeing to sell two of his mansions to Obama’s children.
“It’s a win-win,” Trump told reporters. “We get to lift the sanctions and Russia gets to make a few bucks off of Putin’s personal property. Plus, it’s a great way to strengthen our relationship with Russia.”
The move has been met with criticism from both sides of the aisle, with many accusing Trump of being too soft on Russia and compromising national security. However, Trump has defended the decision, saying that it’s important to be flexible in international diplomacy.
“We can’t just go around imposing sanctions willy-nilly,” Trump said. “We need to be strategic and thoughtful in our approach. And if that means giving Putin’s mansions to Obama’s kids, so be it.”
Despite the criticism, the deal appears to be moving forward, with Putin reportedly already having agreed to sell the properties. However, it’s unclear whether Obama’s children will actually be able to afford the mansions, as they are reportedly worth millions of dollars each."
politifact15579,1,0,"The Second Amendment has continuously been under assault in the United States and in the United Nations. Most often, the attacks came from Democrats and other leftists who have long wanted to see a disarmed populace, with only the government and military maintaining access to firearms. Liberals know that an armed population will not willingly become slaves.The United Nations has long worked, on an international level, to undermine the right of individuals to keep and bear arms, particularly the right of Americans to do so. In a recent document, it sounds like representatives of the United States promised “full implementation” of the UN’s gun-control agreement, and in doing so essentially forfeit the Second and Tenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Perhaps most interestingly of all, the mainstream media has been entirely silent on the issue… perhaps they don’t want to laud this win and stir up patriots?The Third Review Conference for the UN’s Programme of Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons concluded at the end of June. Apparently, American ‘representatives’ at the conference agreed to begin developing ‘legal frameworks’ (generally, laws and regulations) that will enforce “proper management” of “small arms and light weapons” stockpiles.It seems that this agreement also includes ‘stockpiles’ owned by American citizens.The United Nations, an extremely corrupt international government organization with a long track record of failure and few (if any) successes to its name, is hoping that the United States will help it to track (and likely, confiscate) firearms in the country.The conference put out a plan that included demands for a massive database of all organizations, parties, and individuals that manufacture, own, sell, trade, or transfer firearms or ammunition.This will serve as a means for the United Nations to find ‘illicit’ ammunition and firearms.Of course, given the UN’s history of pushing for gun control measures, it’s not beyond the pale to believe that the organization would declare wide swaths of firearms illegal, or that home manufacture of ammunition for private use or resale is illegal.If the United States passes a law, or an executive order, to compel it to cooperate with the UN’s gun control objectives, that could mean that the government would actually seize such equipment on behalf of the international agency.However, it gets worse still. The ‘Programme of Action’ also allows UN ‘peacekeepers’ to go to member nations to ‘assist’ in meeting the goals of the program.So, if the organization decides that the United States should hand over its civilian-owned AR-15s for destruction, and then decides that the process is taking too long, they could send their blue helmet and beret-wearing goons to American shores to ‘help’ speed the process up.The conference produced a list of six points to which all member states agreed.Firstly, they all agreed to establish laws in their nations to support the effective implementation of the Programme of Action (PoA).Secondly, they agreed to strengthen ‘coordinated approaches’ nationally for implementing the PoA.Thirdly, they promised to include women in the mechanism related to said implementation.Fourth, the representatives agreed to create a ‘national point of contact’ to act in the role of liaison between nations and the UN.Fifth, they promised to ‘make better use’ of existing data to push various social and corporate policies in order to be ‘in compliance’ with UN demands concerning women, disarmament, and ‘non-proliferation,’ which generally means not making new firearms for the civilian market.Finally, they agreed to ‘significantly reduce’ illicit flows of small arms through means such as ‘voluntary surrender’ programmes and ‘illicit weapons’ recovery.In other words, the United States government is expected to help push an absurdly anti-Second Amendment set of demands on the American people.If they don’t push that set of rules upon the people swiftly enough, the","It is a matter of public record that the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution has been a subject of intense debate and scrutiny for decades. However, recent events suggest that the amendment is facing a renewed threat, with some advocating for its complete repeal or significant limitations on gun ownership. This development has raised concerns among many Americans who see the Second Amendment as a crucial safeguard against government overreach and tyranny.

Advocates of gun control have long argued that the Second Amendment is outdated and irrelevant in modern society, and that stricter gun laws are necessary to reduce the number of gun-related deaths and injuries. However, critics argue that such laws would only disarm law-abiding citizens while leaving criminal elements with access to firearms. Furthermore, they argue that the Second Amendment is an essential component of American democracy, as it ensures that the people have the ability to defend themselves against a potential tyrannical government.

The debate over the Second Amendment has also extended to the international stage, with some countries advocating for a global gun ban. The United Nations has long been a forum for such discussions, with some countries pushing for stricter gun control measures under the guise of promoting global security. However, critics argue that such efforts are an infringement on individual rights and freedoms, and that the Second Amendment provides a necessary safeguard against such encroachments.

In conclusion, the Second Amendment remains a contentious issue in both the United States and the international community. While some advocate for its repeal or significant limitations, others see it as a vital safeguard against government overreach and tyranny. As the debate continues, it is essential that all parties engage in thoughtful and respectful dialogue, with a focus on finding solutions that balance individual rights with public safety."

politifact14745,1,0,"Read original article hereLiberals sure are afraid of Roy Moore. Not only did they push a woman in front of the cameras to cry and lie about some stuff that allegedly happened 35 years ago she’s just now remembering to mention (we refuse to repeat the salacious allegations because they are 100% verifiable fake news) but when the fake 14-year-old didn’t work for them, the Democrat Party did something even worse: they doubled down on the story, introduced a new actress, and had her tell an even more horrible lie.Fiona Dourif says she was 11 years old when Moore “groped her in the alley behind the” church they both attended in 1957. “It was the most horrifying moment of my life,” she told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow on Friday night. She then described the series of events that allegedly happened, including the obviously false allegation that he baited her into the alley with candy. “Roy Moore definitely did all of those things and more,” she said looking into the camera, dry-eyed.Maddow then interviewed Dourif’s parents, who said that they knew of the alleged abuse but didn’t say anything until he was running for Senator because they “feared for their lives.” Of course, if that was the case they would not have waited until he had more political power and wealth than he did when this allegedly happened.One piece of information Dourif failed to mention is that she is currently employed as a housekeeper for Michelle Obama at the D.C. mansion “she” and her “husband” Barack share. This information was uncovered by Gateway Pundit’s Charles C. Johnson, who notes in his report that “Dourif is paid extremely well according to public documents, which report a $250,783.33 annual salary for Dourif.”“Why would Barack and Michelle Obama’s housekeeper suddenly remember that she was molested by someone who is running for public office – someone of the opposing party,” Johnson writes. “This stinks more than Malia Obama’s dorm room after one of her reefer parties.”What exactly is going on? Ever since it her employer was revealed, Dourif has gone dark, removing all of her social media presences and refusing to respond to interview requests from any source.","Hey, if it doesn’t work, try something even more insane. That’s the Democrat Party’s approach to everything.
It’s not just the one person crying in front of the cameras, but the entire liberal media machine that is pushing this fake news. And they’re not doing it because they care about some teenage girl from 35 years ago, they’re doing it because they’re scared of Roy Moore. They’re scared that he’s going to win the Senate race, and they’re scared that he’s going to be a thorn in their side for the next six years.
The Democrat Party is willing to do anything to prevent that from happening, including manufacturing fake news and putting innocent people’s lives and reputations at risk.
It’s not just Roy Moore who’s being smeared. It’s his wife, his family, his friends, and everyone who supports him. The Democrat Party is doing everything they can to destroy his reputation and ruin his life, all because they’re afraid of him.
And that’s not just sad, it’s pathetic.
The liberal media and the Democrat Party are not just afraid of Roy Moore, they’re afraid of the American people. They’re afraid that the American people are starting to wake up and realize that they’ve been lied to for years, and that the Democrat Party is the real enemy of the people.
The Democrat Party is willing to do anything to stay in power, even if it means destroying innocent people’s lives and ruining the country. They’re not just afraid of Roy Moore, they’re afraid of losing their grip on power, and they’ll do anything to hold on to it."
politifact15123,1,0,"EspañolThe current influenza season has been especially difficult, causing widespread illness that has affected all fifty states and resulted in a record number of hospitalizations. While healthcare professionals continue to combat this year’s flu – which may continue to affect Americans into April – we’re already partnering with other public health agencies to conduct essential work to produce next season’s influenza vaccines.As part of this process, we’re striving to better understand why we saw reduced effectiveness of this year’s influenza vaccines against one strain of influenza A, called H3N2. It was this strain that caused much of the influenza-related illness this flu season. Moreover, this year is not the first time we have seen vaccines be less effective against this particular strain of influenza, H3N2.As such, we are taking a number of actions to better understand why effectiveness tends to be lower against the H3N2 strain and what we can do about it. By looking closely at the available data and applying the lessons we learn each flu season to the vaccine development process, we offer the greatest chance of developing vaccines that even more effectively prevent the flu in the future.These lessons may be applied not only to enhancing the most prevalent process for developing influenza vaccine in eggs, but to considering whether greater investment in alternative processes such as cell-based or recombinant approaches to vaccine development are required. With this statement, I want to outline what we’ve learned so far about this season’s vaccines and the steps we’re taking and plan to take to determine the root cause of this year’s findings and better prepare for future flu seasons.Reduced effectiveness of 2017-2018 seasonal vaccines against H3N2There are a number of theories on why this season’s vaccines produced reduced effectiveness against H3N2. We’re taking steps to investigate each of these potential causes, rule out possible reasons for the variation in effectiveness and improve vaccine efficacy against H3N2. Overall, preliminary vaccine effectiveness reported by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for H3N2 influenza was 25 percent, which means that people who received the vaccine were 25 percent less likely to be sick and need to see a doctor.While that finding isn’t too far off from the vaccine effectiveness seen against H3N2 in previous years, we need to take new steps to improve vaccine efficacy against H3N2. Of note, the effectiveness of the vaccine against H3N2 in children 6 months to 8 years of age was 51 percent this season, yet the effectiveness in those 65 years and older was only 17 percent, and the effectiveness in older children and adults under 65 years of age was even lower. The vaccines did do much better for other viruses that are also causing the flu this season. The data show that overall vaccine effectiveness for H1N1 and influenza B was 67 percent and 42 percent, respectively, for all age groups combined.So why did this season’s vaccines not deliver higher protection against H3N2? And why have vaccines in prior seasons when H3N2 circulated, also delivered reduced protection against this particular flu strain?We don’t think it was a question of getting the particular H3N2 strain wrong when we set out to produce this season’s flu vaccines. Although adapting circulating virus strains for manufacture can lead to differences between the circulating strain and the one used for manufacturing that could affect effectiveness, so far the data we have suggests that the viruses provided by reference laboratories to manufacturers to make this year’s vaccines do reasonably match the circulating flu strains that are causing most of the illnesses, including H3N2.However, we’re working with our colleagues at CDC and other federal agencies to examine and address other factors that might be contributing to the less than optimal overall protection provided by this season’s vaccines against influenz","The current influenza season has been especially difficult, causing widespread illness that has affected all fifty states and resulted in a record number of hospitalizations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that the 2019-2020 flu season was the deadliest in over four decades, with an estimated 37.4 million people affected and over 700,000 hospitalizations.

The influenza virus is highly contagious and can be spread through respiratory droplets that are released when an infected person talks, coughs, or sneezes. The virus can also survive on surfaces for up to 24 hours, making it easy to spread in schools, workplaces, and public places.

The CDC recommends that everyone six months and older receive an annual flu vaccine, which is the best way to protect against the virus. The vaccine is especially important for people who are at high risk of developing serious complications from the flu, including young children, pregnant women, and people with chronic health conditions.

While the flu season typically peaks in January or February, it can last as late as May. It is important to take preventive measures, such as washing your hands frequently, avoiding close contact with sick people, and staying home if you are feeling ill. If you do get the flu, there are antiviral drugs that can help reduce the severity of symptoms and shorten the duration of illness."
politifact15525,1,0,"It was June 2014 when the Washington Post reported that illegal immigrants, “including thousands of women and children, stream into south Texas. It was nine months late when the same paper reported that Obama’s border agents were tossing some of those kids into internment camps as an experiment.It was called the Juvenile Referral Process, and it worried human rights groups Mexican officials who feared that it put the kids at risk. The program was the creation of Robert Harris who at the time U.S. Customs and Border Protection commander of the Laredo sector. Harris believed holding certain young Mexicans, believed to be working for cartels in detention serves to get these kids out of the smuggling enterprise. Believed is the operative word, There were no judges, no charges– no trial–just belief.His intelligence analysts estimated that 78 percent of the guides smuggling other migrants were Mexicans younger than 18 — teenagers often hired or conscripted by drug cartels that knew they would not be prosecuted if caught — and he wanted to attack this loophole. “Why don’t we remove these juveniles from the smuggling cycle?” Harris, the outgoing commander of the Laredo sector of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, recalled thinking. Trending: Journalist Laura Loomer Files Assault Charges Against Maxine Waters Now, as a result of that decision, young Mexicans are being held for months without charge in shelters across the United States, sometimes without their parents’ knowledge. Since the program began in May, 536 juveniles have been held — 248 of whom have been deported to Mexico after an average stay of 75 days, according to Border Patrol statistics. Mexican authorities say some of these repeat border-crossers have spent as much as six months in U.S. custody while they await an appearance before an immigration judge. During their detention, they are questioned by U.S. authorities and then transferred to a network of facilities run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, part of the Department of Health and Human Services, across 15 states.Lets put this in perspective, under Trump children are separated from their parents because they don’t want the kids going to jail with their parents. Under Obama, young illegal immigrants were put in “facilities” so they could be squeezed for any information they may or may not have about drug cartels.“Our concern is that the program’s real intent is to interrogate the kids,” said Maureen Meyer, an expert on Mexico and migrants at the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA). The kids are “often questioned about the criminal groups they are working for and then subsequently returned to Mexico with no apparent concern about the implications for them.” While in custody last year [2014], one Mexican boy who worked as a guide shared information with U.S. authorities about the location of stash houses used by migrants as they move through the United States, according to his lawyer’s written summary of his case. When he returned to Mexico, he learned that armed men had forced their way into his home and killed a relative’s son. The men told the family that there had been raids on cartel hideouts and arrests and that they believed the boy was responsible. His half-brother was later killed by the same group. The boy, his lawyer said, has since been in hiding. Harris said the Border Patrol does not have a system to track what happens to the juveniles once they return to Mexico. The program does appear to be discouraging them from returning illegally to Texas, he said. The patrol calculates that just 7 percent of the children who have gone through the program has been picked up again crossing the border.But the program was a surprise to Mexico“The moment it started, it took us all by surprise, because there wasn’t an announcement,” said Reyna Torres Mendívil, director general of the Mexican Foreign Ministry’s office for protection of Mexicans abroad. “Where were they taking these children?”Regarding prevent","Illegal immigrants, including thousands of women and children, continue to stream into South Texas. According to recent reports, the number of immigrants apprehended at the border has increased significantly over the past few months. The majority of these individuals come from Central America, seeking refuge from violence and instability in their home countries.

Despite the dangerous journey, many immigrants continue to risk everything to reach the United States. They often face harsh conditions, including extreme heat and limited access to food, water, and medical care, during their journey through Mexico.

The situation has become so dire that the government has had to set up temporary shelters to house and care for these immigrants. However, the shelters are often overcrowded and understaffed, leading to inadequate care for many of the individuals in need.

The influx of immigrants has also put a strain on the resources of local communities, as they struggle to provide basic necessities such as housing and healthcare. Some residents have expressed concern that the immigrants are taking away jobs and resources from American citizens.

The United States government has promised to address the issue and increase efforts to secure the border. However, many believe that more needs to be done to address the root causes of the immigration crisis, including poverty, violence, and political instability in Central America.

In the meantime, the stream of immigrants continues, with no end in sight."

In a surprising turn of events, it has been revealed that many individuals who have commented on news articles anonymously may not, in fact, be anonymous at all. The revelation has sparked outrage among those who value their privacy and the right to free speech.

According to a recent study conducted by a team of computer scientists, the majority of anonymous comments on news websites are made using IP addresses that can be traced back to specific individuals or organizations. This means that even though a commenter may believe they are remaining anonymous, their true identity may be easily discoverable by those with the knowledge and resources to track it down.

The news has sent shockwaves through the media industry and has raised serious questions about the true level of privacy and anonymity that exists on the internet. Many news organizations are now re-evaluating their commenting policies and are considering implementing measures to better protect the privacy of their readers.

However, not everyone is convinced that this is a necessary step. Some argue that the benefits of allowing anonymous commenting, such as increased engagement and the ability to voice controversial opinions without fear of retribution, outweigh the potential risks.

As the debate continues, it remains to be seen how news organizations will balance the need for free and open discussion with the right to privacy."

During this same week last year, CNN averaged 1.191 million. That is a -29 percent collapse.CNN’s average total day viewers disintegrated by -25 percent, 841K compared to 635K.In other words, throughout the day last week, CNN could only attract an average of 635,000 total viewers.Fox News, however, is thriving. Last week, Fox averaged 2.487 million primetime viewers, nearly three times that of CNN’s 844K, and 1.463 million total day viewers, more than twice CNN’s 635K.While MSNBC is in a distant second place behind Fox, it is still leaving CNN in the dust with an average of 1.667 million primetime viewers and 913K total day viewers.Incredibly, CNN’s second week of May this year was even worse than the first week, which was already catastrophic. During week one, CNN attracted a dismal 859K primetime viewers, but that was still better than week two, which dropped even further to 844K. In total day viewers, the anti-Trump channel dipped from a ruinous week one of just 649K viewers to an even more ruinous week two of 635K.Compared to the full month of May last year, the Stormy Daniels Network is collapsing even more in the advertiser-coveted 25-54 age demo.During the full month of May 2017, CNN average 399K demo viewers during primetime. Last week that number collapsed a whopping -35 percent to just 259K.

On Monday, despite the massive news surrounding the opening of the American embassy in Jerusalem, CNN averaged a dismal 643K total day viewers, compared to Fox and MSNBC’s 1.76 million and 1.13 million, respectively.During primetime Monday, CNN could only attract a scant 765K total viewers. Fox nearly quadrupled CNN with 2.89 million viewers.

New York, May 15th, 2023 - In a shocking turn of events, CNN, one of the most prominent news networks in the world, is on the verge of permanently closing its doors after its ratings collapsed even more than last week, falling a staggering 30 percent in the second week of May. The network's management announced that they have been facing an unprecedented crisis, and that they have exhausted all possible solutions to reverse the decline in viewership.

""This is a dark day for journalism,"" said the network's CEO in a statement. ""CNN has been a trusted source of news for decades, and we are deeply saddened that we have reached this point. Our team has worked tirelessly to provide our audience with the most accurate and impartial reporting, but it seems that our efforts have not been enough.""

The decline in ratings can be attributed to a variety of factors, including the proliferation of fake news and misinformation on social media, the rise of new competitors, and the changing habits of viewers who now consume news through different platforms. However, the network's management insists that the decision to close its doors is not a reflection of the quality of its journalism but rather a result of the challenging media landscape.

""We are proud of the work that we have done, and we will continue to do so until the very end,"" said the network's president. ""We have always been committed to providing our audience with the most comprehensive and objective reporting, and we will continue to do so until the very end. We are deeply saddened that we will no longer be able to serve our audience, but we hope that our legacy will continue to inspire future generations of journalists.""

The closure of CNN is expected to have a significant impact on the media landscape, as the network has been a major player in the industry for decades. However, the network's management remains optimistic that its legacy will continue to inspire future generations of journalists. ""We may be closing our doors, but the spirit of CNN will live on,"" said the network's CEO. ""We will continue to fight for truth and justice, and we will never stop seeking the truth."""

Neither, according to the State Board of Elections.The true explanation is much less exciting.Prior to passage of the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) in 1993, the state did not require those registering to provide their birth date. While most voters who registered before NVRA did provide birth dates, some did not. These voters were automatically assigned a default birth date of 01/01/1900 in the state’s voter rolls. So while these voters are still diligently voting, it is very doubtful they are 112 years old.","A spokesman for the North Carolina Board of Elections said that the state's voter registration system does not have a way to verify the ages of voters, but that the state's voter rolls are regularly updated to remove those who have passed away. The board has not received any reports of voter fraud in relation to the voting by centenarians.

However, a spokesperson for the North Carolina Republican Party said that the party is concerned about the high number of centenarians voting in the state and has called for an investigation into the matter. The party spokesperson said that the state's voter rolls are not properly maintained and that the state needs to do more to prevent voter fraud.

Critics of the Republican Party's call for an investigation have accused the party of using the issue to suppress the votes of elderly voters, many of whom are likely to vote for Democratic candidates. They argue that the state's voter rolls are properly maintained and that the high number of centenarians voting is simply a sign of the state's growing elderly population.

In conclusion, while the North Carolina Board of Elections has not received any reports of voter fraud related to the voting by centenarians, the state's voter rolls are regularly updated to remove those who have passed away.

politifact14940,1,0,"Full text: Jeff Flake on Trump speech transcriptPrepared remarks for Sen. Jeff Flake, who delivered a speech to the Senate on Jan. 17, 2018.Mr. President, near the beginning of the document that made us free, our Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson wrote: “We hold these truths to be self-evident...” So, from our very beginnings, our freedom has been predicated on truth. The founders were visionary in this regard, understanding well that good faith and shared facts between the governed and the government would be the very basis of this ongoing idea of America.Story Continued BelowAs the distinguished former member of this body, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, famously said: “Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not to his own facts.” During the past year, I am alarmed to say that Senator Moynihan’s proposition has likely been tested more severely than at any time in our history.It is for that reason that I rise today, to talk about the truth, and its relationship to democracy. For without truth, and a principled fidelity to truth and to shared facts, Mr. President, our democracy will not last.2017 was a year which saw the truth – objective, empirical, evidence-based truth -- more battered and abused than any other in the history of our country, at the hands of the most powerful figure in our government. It was a year which saw the White House enshrine “alternative facts” into the American lexicon, as justification for what used to be known simply as good old-fashioned falsehoods. It was the year in which an unrelenting daily assault on the constitutionally-protected free press was launched by that same White House, an assault that is as unprecedented as it is unwarranted. “The enemy of the people,” was what the president of the United States called the free press in 2017.The most reliable politics newsletter.

It bears noting that so fraught with malice was the phrase “enemy of the people,” that even Nikita Khrushchev forbade its use, telling the Soviet Communist Party that the phrase had been introduced by Stalin for the purpose of “annihilating such individuals” who disagreed with the supreme leader.This alone should be a source of great shame for us in this body, especially for those of us in the president’s party. For they are shameful, repulsive statements. And, of course, the president has it precisely backward – despotism is the enemy of the people. The free press is the despot’s enemy, which makes the free press the guardian of democracy. When a figure in power reflexively calls any press that doesn’t suit him “fake news,” it is that person who should be the figure of suspicion, not the press.I dare say that anyone who has the privilege and awesome responsibility to serve in this chamber knows that these reflexive slurs of “fake news” are dubious, at best. Those of us who travel overseas, especially to war zones and other troubled areas around the globe, encounter members of U.S. based media who risk their lives, and sometimes lose their lives, reporting on the truth. To dismiss their work as fake news is an affront to their commitment and their sacrifice.According to the International Federation of Journalists, 80 journalists were killed in 2017, and a new report from the Committee to Protect Journalists documents that the number of journalists imprisoned around the world has reached 262, which is a new record. This total includes 21 reporters who are being held on “false news” charges.Mr. President, so powerful is the presidency that the damage done by the sustained attack on the truth will not be confined to the president’s time in ","President, it is said that we are the last best hope of earth, that we are the nation that has never caused a war, and that has never lost a war, that we are the nation that has never imposed a tax on the people without their consent.In my view, we are also the nation that has never had a president who has so little regard for the truth. Mr. President, I rise today to address the statements of the President of the United States. I had hoped that the President would use this moment in time to bring the country together, to heal the wounds of the past year, and to provide a vision for the future. Instead, the President delivered a speech that was filled with misrepresentations of the truth. The President's speech was not just misleading, it was a deliberate assault on the truth. Mr. President, I am not naive. I understand that there are different ways to interpret the events of the past year. I understand that there are different policies that we can pursue to address the challenges that we face as a nation. But I also believe that there are some things that are beyond debate, some things that we can all agree on, regardless of our party or our political beliefs. One of those things is that the President of the United States has a responsibility to tell the truth. The President of the United States has a responsibility to be honest with the American people. The President of the United States is not just a leader, he is the leader of the free world. He is looked to by billions of people around the globe as a beacon of hope and a symbol of democracy. When the President of the United States lies to the American people, he undermines that hope and that symbolism. Mr. President, the President's speech was not just misleading, it was a deliberate assault on the truth. He did not just exaggerate, he invented. He did not just distort, he flat-out lied. The President's speech was a direct assault on the truth, and on the rule of law. It was a direct assault on the very foundation of our democracy. Mr. President, the President's speech was not just misleading, it was dangerous. When the President of the United States lies to the American people, he creates a climate of mistrust. When the President of the United States undermines the rule of law, he puts our democracy at risk. When the President of the United States attacks the media, he threatens the very foundation of our democracy. The President's speech was a direct assault on the truth, and on the rule of law. It was a direct assault on the very foundation of our democracy. Mr. President, the President's speech was not just misleading, it was dangerous. It was a direct assault on the truth, and on the rule of law. It was a direct assault on the very foundation of our democracy. We are the last best hope of earth. We are the nation that has never caused a war, and that has never lost a war. We are the nation that has never imposed a tax on the people without their consent. We are also the nation that has never had a president who has so little regard for the truth. That is not who we are. That is not who we should be. We are better than that. We must demand more from our leaders. We must demand the truth. We must demand honesty. We must demand integrity. We must demand decency. We must demand respect for the rule of law. We must demand respect for our democracy. We are the last best hope of earth. We are the nation that has never caused a war, and that has never lost a war.

politifact14289,1,0,"It is being reported that Australia is becoming the first nation in the world to begin microchipping its citizens. This surprising new development is the result of several years of a sustained propaganda that has actually led to Australian citizens voluntarily putting themselves forward for the controversial program.Australia is getting its citizens microchippedShanti Korporaal, who lives in the Australian city of Sydney has found herself at the center of headlines of the new venture after having implants surgically implanted in both of her hands. She says that she has no regrets about the procedure and that she encourages others to follow in her footsteps. The implants are fitted with a unique identifier which can be used to get through locked doors, to transfer personal information into devices and even connected to bank details. ""You could set up your life, so you never have to worry about any passwords or PINs, ""Korporaal told reporters when justifying her decision. Another anonymous individual who had also voluntarily undergone the procedure said that they had done it for the purpose of ‘convenience.'But while it may be convenient in the short-term, the long-term implications of having microchips implanted directly into the human body are terrifying. Modern technology has allowed the government and law enforcement agencies an almost unprecedented level of access to the details of the lives of ordinary citizens. In the United States, there are regular reports that indicate that law enforcement agencies such as the police and the FBI are already tracking cell phones without a warrant on a fairly routine basis. In addition to this, revelations by the whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed that the government is accessing and storing a vast amount of information about every single person, whether they are under suspicion or not, from their online devices.This means that civil liberties campaigners are deeply concerned about this burgeoning trend of microchipping which will essentially allow the government to have a permanent record of a citizen’s every movement and transaction. After all, the only way to remove a surgically implanted microchip is another painful operation. Civil liberties advocates are baffled by the way private citizens are actually volunteering to forego their privacy and security in such an intrusive manner.","---

Canberra, Australia - In a stunning move that has sent shockwaves around the world, the Australian government has announced plans to microchip its citizens, making it the first nation in the world to do so. The controversial decision has been met with both outrage and approval, with some hailing it as a step forward in national security while others decry it as a violation of privacy.

According to government officials, the microchipping program is the result of several years of sustained propaganda that has led to many Australian citizens voluntarily putting themselves forward for the procedure. The chips, which are roughly the size of a grain of rice, will be implanted in the hands of citizens and will allow them to access government services and facilities with just a wave of their hand.

Critics of the program have raised concerns about the potential for abuse and the erosion of privacy. They argue that the government could use the microchips to track citizens' movements and monitor their behavior, potentially infringing on their civil liberties.

Despite these concerns, supporters of the program point to the benefits of increased security and convenience. With the chips, citizens will be able to quickly and easily access government services, reducing wait times and streamlining the bureaucratic process.

As the world watches closely, Australia will become the first nation to implement a microchipping program on a large scale. While the implications of this decision remain to be seen, one thing is clear: the era of microchip technology in government has arrived, and it is sure to be a topic of intense debate and discussion for years to come."
politifact15304,1,0,"USDA approves slaughterhouses producing horse meat for human consumptionYou might have to train your taste buds to get used to horse meat soon, because FYI: The U.S. government just approved the operation of horse meat slaughterhouses to produce meat for human consumption.New Mexico, Missouri and Iowa are just some of the areas where horse meat plants are expected to be approved by the USDA. While horse meat, technically, can’t be legally sold in the United States for human consumption, it may still turn up in the US food supply because it can be sold to Mexico, then re-labeled and shipped back to the USA as a low-cost meat filler. This has already been documented occurring in Europe, where meatballs sold in European grocery stores were found to be made with horse meat.Where do these horses come from?While horse meat slaughterhouses were banned during the Bush Administration, the ban expired in 2011 under President Obama’s watch, thereby allowing horse meat slaughterhouses to restart operations.Reuters claims that around 130,000 horses are slaughtered each year in Canada and Mexico — and it seems the United States wants a huge chunk of that business, as well.Not-so-fun fact: Most horse meat come from horse owners who decide to have their horses killed for a variety of reasons, such as illness, injury, or simply because they cannot afford to keep their horses fed and cared for anymore.Many of these owners sell their horses to slaughterhouses for an incredibly low amount. Yep, you read that right: They allow strangers to haul their horses away to a meat packing plant, only to be slaughtered mercilessly around several other screaming horses.Do keep all this in mind the next time you consider buying a horse for your family. Raising one requires a tremendous amount of effort, so be a responsible horse owner. Don’t let your pet get slaughtered once you get tired of it — because if you do, it might eventually end up on your plate the next time you purchase some meatballs for your spaghetti.Source used:NaturalNews.com","USDA has just approved the first three slaughterhouses in the US to produce horse meat for human consumption since 2007.

The USDA's decision has been met with mixed reactions. Animal welfare organizations are opposed to the move, arguing that horses are not raised for food and are often subjected to cruel treatment during transport and slaughter. However, proponents of the decision argue that it will create jobs and reduce the number of unwanted horses that are currently being sent to slaughter in Mexico and Canada.

It's worth noting that while horse meat is not commonly consumed in the US, it is considered a delicacy in some parts of the world, including Europe and Japan. In fact, the European Union is one of the largest importers of horse meat, with France being one of the biggest consumers.

The USDA's approval of the three slaughterhouses is expected to pave the way for the re-opening of several more facilities in the coming months. However, it remains to be seen whether the move will be met with resistance from animal rights activists and environmental groups, who are concerned about the potential impact on animal welfare and the environment.

In any case, it looks like we may soon see horse meat appearing on the shelves of supermarkets and restaurants in the US. Whether or not consumers will embrace the new option remains to be seen, but it's clear that the USDA's decision has opened up a new chapter in the country's food industry."
