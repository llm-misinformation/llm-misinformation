4999,1,0,Says Nostradamus predicted the coronavirus in a 1551 passage about a plague spreading from the east.  ,"Quoted by the UK-based 'Daily Mail' on February 22, 2 Yvonne Ridley: The Muslim convert who defied the Taliban
Yvonne Ridley is a British journalist who was captured by the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2001 and later released in a video showing her conversion to Islam. She has since become an advocate for women's rights and a prominent voice in the fight against extremism.
Born in 1958 in South Wales, Ridley began her career as a nurse before moving into journalism, working for a number of newspapers and broadcasters in the UK and abroad.
She first went to Afghanistan in 2001 as a freelance journalist for the Agence France-Presse (AFP) news agency, covering the Taliban's rule and the US-led invasion that followed. On September 11, 2001, she was in the United States when the 9/11 attacks occurred, and she was subsequently caught up in the chaos of the subsequent invasion of Afghanistan.
On September 10, 2001, she was in the United States when the 9/11 attacks occurred, and she was subsequently caught up in the chaos of the subsequent invasion of Afghanistan. She was captured by the Taliban on September 12, along with two other Western journalists, and was held for 11 days before being released in a video showing her conversion to Islam.
After her release, Ridley became a vocal advocate for women's rights and a prominent critic of extremism, and has written extensively on these issues. She has also worked as a broadcaster, appearing on television and radio in the UK and abroad, and has given lectures and talks on a range of topics related to journalism, women's rights, and extremism.
In 2013, she founded the Press For Women charity, which works to promote the rights of women and girls around the world. The charity has received support from a number of high-profile figures, including the actress Angelina Jolie and the singer Annie Lennox.
Ridley's experiences as a journalist and as a captive of the Taliban have made her a powerful voice in the fight against extremism and a champion of women's rights. Her story is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the power of the media to shape public opinion and bring about change."
