Dancing With the Stars will return for its 22nd season with Len Goodman back where he belongs, Bindi Irwin as the reigning champ, and a baby boy or girl for Allison Holker. There's much to look forward to, but not before we close out this season one last time with everything that happened after the finale! (In case you missed it, you can read our recap of the best and worst moments here .) Almost an hour after Tom Bergeron declared Bindi Irwin and Derek Hough the winners of season 21, Bindi was still in disbelief, shouting from the top of her lungs, ""I think I'm going to scream for 20 minutes!"" Her exuberance and genuine nature endeared her to literally every one on set, but no one more so than Derek. ""It's just so special with Bindi,"" he told reporters backstage. ""She's a champion of life."" Bindi shared the same sentiment, telling those in the ballroom that she gained another brother in Derek. In case you needed further proof that the two are friends for life, consider this: Derek's hopping on a plane to Australia in a couple weeks ""to tackle crocodiles and get my official khakis!"" The Houghster may have nabbed his sixth Mirrorball trophy, but it was his partnership with Bindi that undoubtedly made it his favorite season. ""There's not a thing I would change about this season,"" he told Glamour post-show. ""There's not a week I would change, a dance I would change, and that was a very calming, very peaceful feeling. The show is a completely different show than the first time I won, and to win at this level and the standard that this show has been raised to, it's been incredible."" While Bindi and Derek make the press rounds in New York City, it's no secret that she's itching to get back to her hometown down under. ""I can't wait to get back to all the animals, continue all the conservation work, and carry on in my dad's footsteps."" Season 21 runner-ups Sharna Burgess and Nick Carter were understandably disappointed not to win the big prize, but they both praised Bindi and Derek for their phenomenal journey this season. ""Bindi was the whole package,"" praised the red-haired stunner. ""She and Derek had a beautiful partnership."" Still, ""it's bittersweet in may ways. Did I really want this to be my first Mirrorball? Absolutely. I would be lying if I said I didn't. But Bindi was undeniable this entire season. She grew so much, and she's just such a beautiful person you can't help but be captivated by her. Both [she and Nick] are winners, and I truly believe that."" Echoed Nick: ""It was just such a pleasure to be here. I didn't expect to get anything, so anytime something great happened in the competition, it was a pleasant surprise to me."" So what's up next for Nick? Well, aside from getting ready for Baby Boy Carter , his solo album ( All American ) drops today, and he has a movie coming out next year that he wrote and directed. As for third-place contestant, Alek Skarlatos , he'll be heading on the DWTS Tour this winter, but his immediate plans are much simpler: ""I can't wait to get on the plane tonight to eat. A lot."" But what about his dating life? Any updates on that? ""It's been pretty crazy, honestly. [I haven't had time] for many dates lately."" Added Lindsay: ""I'll be his wing woman on tour!"" During all the hectic action backstage, Allison Holker was a ball of energy, especially for someone six month's pregnant. ""I feel incredible!"" gushed the pro. ""Dancing around with a baby that's the size of a football in your belly is never an easy task, but it's been amazing. Although I never expected to see myself in a sparkly costume on the Dancing With the Stars stage six months pregnant!"" Allison (and husband tWitch) will find out the baby's gender on December 10, ""which is our anniversary too."" In case you're wondering, she'll reveal whether it's a boy or a girl on social media shortly thereafter! In the meantime, Allison's prepping for her first Thanksgiving in charge of the turkey as long as the ne","Dancing With the Stars: Returning Judges and New Contestants

gossipcop-2761931201,1,0,"Lou Rocco/Getty Images  How Michael Strahan’s net worth was built  Michael Strahan has grown his wealth through 14 years of playing pro football and his second career as a talk-show host.  The son of an Army major, Strahan grew up in Germany and did not play competitive high school football until his senior year when his parents sent him to live with his aunt and uncle in Texas.  The former defensive end played well enough to earn a scholarship to Texas Southern University. By his senior year of college, he had set a record for sacks, which got the attention of the NFL.  In 1993, the New York Giants drafted Strahan as the 40th overall draft pick. Over the next 14 seasons, he became the league’s all-time quarterback sack leader, played in the Pro Bowl and helped the Giants defeat the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLII.  Upon retiring in 2008, Strahan concentrated on his off-field talents. In 2012, he became Kelly Ripa’s “Live! With Kelly” co-host, replacing longtime host Regis Philbin. Four years later, he left the show and joined ABC’s “Good Morning America”; it took more than a year for “Live” to announce Ryan Seacrest as its new co-host.  Strahan also serves as a Fox NFL Sunday analyst during the football season.  As of May 2017, Strahan’s net worth was $65 million, with a salary of $17 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.  You can use this net worth calculator to see your net worth.  Michael Strahan  Born: 1971  Birthplace: Houston  What he’s up to now  Strahan hung up his jersey in 2008, but he did not retire quietly. As of April 2016, he is a full-time co-host on ABC’s morning show “Good Morning America.”  Months later, the network hired him to host his own game show, “$100,000 Pyramid,” a reboot of an old classic. The fashionable football star also launched his own clothing line in 2015 in JC Penney stores.  Along with Curt Menefee, Terry Bradshaw, Howie Long and Jimmy Johnson, Strahan appears on “Fox NFL Sunday” each week during the NFL season.  Accolades  Throughout both his college and pro football careers, Strahan had a reputation for sacking quarterbacks, and in 2001, he set the record for most sacks in an NFL season. He also appeared in the Pro Bowl seven times.  In 2008, after his final season in the NFL, he helped lead the New York Giants to a Super Bowl victory over the New England Patriots.  As a morning show host, Strahan has earned two Daytime Emmy Awards for “Outstanding Talk Show Host” for his work on “Live! With Kelly and Michael.”","The Super Bowl champ’s net worth is estimated at $65 million.

Here's a news piece based on the sentence:

Former NFL defensive end Michael Strahan has amassed an impressive fortune through a successful career on the gridiron and his subsequent ventures in the media industry. According to estimates, Strahan's net worth currently stands at a staggering $65 million.

Strahan's 14-year career in the NFL, during which he won a Super Bowl with the New York Giants, undoubtedly served as the foundation for his financial success. However, it was his transition to a talk-show host that truly catapulted his wealth.

In 2012, Strahan joined the cast of ABC's ""Live with Kelly and Michael,"" alongside Kelly Ripa, and quickly became a fan favorite. His charismatic personality and engaging interview style helped to boost the show's ratings and increase its advertising revenue.

Moreover, Strahan has also made savvy investments in various business ventures, including a fitness app and a men's grooming line. These ventures have not only diversified his income streams but have also contributed to his overall net worth.

Strahan's financial success is a testament to his hard work and dedication to his craft. As he continues to excel in the media industry, his net worth is likely to continue growing in the years to come."
gossipcop-7392274516,1,0,"They both looked so happy, and so relaxed. They were beaming as they said their vows, and luckily, no one came forward to provide any reason that they might not be married. (This is always an exciting moment in a ceremony.) It was an extraordinary mix of tradition and modernity, of centuries of history and up-to-the moment flourishes. Oprah was here, and so was Meghan’s mother, an African-American social worker who wore a conventional mother-of-the-bride outfit and also a nose stud. It somehow looked charming and just right. The entire royal family was here, along with a complement of English aristocrats and important personages. The music was stately and beautiful. The setting was awe-inspiring. There was a flotilla of clergymen, an extraordinary mélange including the archbishop of Canterbury and — in a striking inclusion in this most ancient of places — the head of the Episcopal Church, the Most Rev. Michael Curry. Chosen to give the address to the congregations, Bishop Curry, who is African-American, quoted Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. His voice rising and falling with emotion, he made a big, generous, impassioned case for love as the most important thing there is, in religion and in life. His address came after a reading by Lady Jane Fellowes, Harry’s aunt (her sister was Diana, Princess of Wales) that was both full of joy and a signal, it seemed, that the sadness in Harry’s life since his mother’s death had finally lifted. It was a passage from the Song of Solomon: “Arise my love, my fair one, and come away; for now the winter is past, the rain is over and gone.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story The dress was a success: sculptural simplicity. Photo Our fashion critic, Vanessa Friedman, is also watching, and she has a quick take for us on Meghan Markle’s dress. It was absolutely simple: pure and sculptural, in double bonded silk cady with a wide boatneck, long sleeves and sweeping train. It was Meghan Markle’s wedding dress. It was by Clare Waight Keller, a British woman and the first female designer of Givenchy. And it was everything people had hoped. This was not a Cinderella choice, not one that spoke of fantasy or old-fashioned fairy tales. Instead, it placed the woman proudly front and center and underscored Ms. Markle’s own independence. At the same time, it celebrated female strength, promoted a local designer and reached a hand across to Europe (where Ms. Waight Keller has a day job). The five-meter veil was of silk tulle, with a trim of hand-embroidered flowers in silk threads and organza, and contained embroidery representing the flora of all 53 Commonwealth nations. Video And it was entirely a surprise. In all the rumors that had swirled around The Dress, from Ralph & Russo to Stella McCartney, Ms. Waight Keller’s name had never come up. In the end, Ms. Markle outthought us all. As this starts, long may it continue.

Lovato also had brief flings with Trace Cyrus (Miley’s older brother) in 2009 and Joe Jonas, her self-proclaimed “BFF,” in 2010. Her most notable relationship to date, however, has been with Valderrama, whom she dated from from 2010 to 2016. In an interview with Latina magazine, Lovato discussed what attracted her to the That 70’s Show actor: When I dated white guys, it wasn’t as passionate as my relationship with Wilmer. Maybe that’s just Wilmer. But I do believe that Latin people are just more expressive, more passionate with their emotions. He’s very manly, and he can be stubborn like Latino men can, but he’s protective and he cares so much and loves so hard. I’ve been blessed enough to have him in my life, and not just as my man, but also my best friend. Since her breakup from Valderrama, Lovato’s been seen with MMA fighter Guilherme “Bomba” Vasconcelos and Abedini. 3.

gossipcop-5319163677,1,0,"Come December, it's become near tradition over the past few years for everyone to complain about how the previous 12 months have been the worst ever. This year, however really, really feels like it. This year has been a barrage of bizarre and bummer headlines that at times it's felt like some dystopian nightmare.  It's been so bad that the Kardashian-West clan have just decided to end 2016 early. Yes, Kim and Kanye have decided to cancel all public and professional commitments for the end of the year and plan to maintain their social media blackouts as well. To be exact, a flack told Page Six that Kim and Kanye “plan on taking the rest of 2016 off and spending time as a family.""  Which, frankly, we wish we all could do, don't we?  Is it possible for President Obama's last major act to be an executive decree for us to just all get a chance to chill out and recuperate for the remaining 26 days left in this bummer of a year? Sure, there's no political safeguarding against any potential additional music legends from dying or preventing any further tragedies and disasters from happening or ensuring that some new odd Zika-like disease pops up, but there's got to be something? How about the ""Netflix and Chill Act?"" Just an order that all Americans get to spend the next month relaxing and catching up on any television series they may have missed this year.  Of course, when it comes to Kim and Kanye it's understandable that they've decided to literally cancel the rest of their 2016. Kim was still in the midst of recuperating from being robbed at gunpoint in Paris when her husband Kanye was hospitalized following a very public breakdown.  They've had to endure these private tragedies while also dealing with immense public interest and rumors running rampant in the tabloid press.  E!, the home of the Kardashian's reality TV empire, reports that a family source says ""Kim is doing okay despite reports.""  ""She has many things on her plate so being overwhelmed is expected,"" the source continued. ""She wants to get Kanye back on his feet. She is not leaving him. She loves him.""  Kanye was released from an L.A.-area hospital last week after spending more than a week receiving treatment for exhaustion. Kim West was reportedly by his side throughout the entire ordeal and now wants to make sure Kanye continues to receive therapy and treatment now that he's out of the hospital.  Despite your personal opinion on the pair, it certainly does seem like the family deserves the rest. In addition to their dual ordeal, they also have two young children to care for after all (in fact, today is Saint West's first birthday). Maybe it's best we all let them lay low and chill for the next month or so.  Unfortunately, we all don't have the luxury as much as we wish we could. Then again, it's not looking like 2017 is shaping up to be any better. Hopefully, a rested and healthier Kim and Kanye can get back into form and provide us with the not-quite-as-tragic-as-this distractions we'll probably desperately need in the new year.  Update: Kanye, for one, has now reappeared in public, albeit in a very low-key way. He was spotted with newly blond hair at designer Rick Owens' furniture show in Los Angeles .","Come December, it's become near tradition over the past few years for everyone to complain about how the previous 12 months have been the worst ever. As the holiday season approaches, people across the globe are bracing themselves for the annual onslaught of complaints about the state of the world.

According to experts, this trend is not just limited to social media, where people often take to platforms like Twitter and Facebook to air their grievances. Instead, it has become a widespread phenomenon, with people from all walks of life expressing their dissatisfaction with the past year.

""It's become a kind of ritual, where people feel the need to proclaim that the previous year was the worst ever, as if it's some kind of badge of honor,"" said Dr. Jane Smith, a psychologist at XYZ University. ""It's a way of processing and making sense of the challenges and hardships that we've faced over the past year.""

Despite the prevalence of this trend, there are also many people who are actively working to change the narrative and focus on the positive aspects of the past year. ""We don't want to get caught up in the negativity and doom and gloom,"" said John Doe, a community organizer in New York City. ""We want to focus on the progress we've made and the good things that have happened, so that we can build on those successes and create a better future for everyone.""

As the world prepares to ring in the new year, it remains to be seen whether this trend of complaining about the previous year will continue, or if people will begin to shift their focus towards a more positive and hopeful outlook for the future."

The private restaurant has long operated under the radar in Los Angeles, with rumors circulating about who has attended and what is really served behind closed doors. Now a leaked Cannibal Club document has exposed some of the notorious restaurant’s “elite” patrons.  CANNIBALISM ‘MORE POPULAR THAN YOU MIGHT THINK’  Meryl Streep, Chelsea Clinton and CNN’s Anderson Cooper all hold Cannibal Club membership, according to the document. Katy Perry, who has previously said that “Cannibalism is way more popular than you might think” and “human flesh is the best meat“, is also a regular diner.  Boasting that the restaurant is the “cutting edge of experimental cuisine” and serves “L.A.’s cultural elite“, the Cannibal Club website makes clear they “specialize in the preparation of human meat” that comes from “young and healthy bodies.“  Cannibal Club’s visiting chefs “hail from around the world” and come to L.A. to “practice their craft free of compromise and unbounded by convention,” according to the Cannibal Club website.  ‘FILMMAKERS, INTELLECTUALS, AND CELEBRITIES’  “Our exclusive clientele includes noted filmmakers, intellectuals, and celebrities who have embraced the Enlightenment ideals of free expression and rationalism. On event nights, avant-garde performance artists, celebrated literary figures, and ground-breaking musicians entertain our guests.  “At Cannibal Club, we celebrate artistic excellence as the natural and inevitable expression of the unbridled human spirit.“  Describing each dish as a “study in taste and elegance“, Chef de Cuisine Sophie Laffite explains: “The meat we serve is selected from the young and healthy.

According to a new report, the Real Housewives of New Jersey star is planning to cash in on her husband Joe Giudice’s deportation proceedings.  If you recall, it was reported weeks ago that a judge had ruled that Joe should be deported upon his release from prison, where he is currently serving a 41-month-prison sentence for bank and wire fraud. Well now, sources are telling Radar Online that Bravo has offered Teresa $500,000 to film a special about his deportation.  “Teresa was offered big bucks to film a special about Joe’s deportation and she agreed to do it,” an insider revealed. “Half a million dollars to share the story on camera.”  And this story is believable because this isn’t Teresa’s first rodeo when it comes to cashing in on her crimes legal drama!  “It is going to be like the other specials when she was in prison and will show how she and Joe and the girls are handling the scary prospect of Joe getting deported,” added the source.  IS TERESA BEGGING PRESIDENT TRUMP TO STOP JOE’S DEPORTATION?  Earlier this year, an Immigration official confirmed that “records show that an immigration judge ordered Mr. Giudice be removed from the United States on March 14, 2018.”  A source close to Teresa adds that she needs the Bravo money as Joe tries to appeal the deportation order.  “Teresa will do anything for the money. She never stops thinking about taking care of her girls and she agreed to this so that they would have money for college. She is a good mom and wants to provide for her children,” the source stated.  Joe will reportedly be turned over to ICE custody upon his March 2019 release, although it is likely he could be released earlier than March which would mean an earlier deportation back to Italy.  UPDATE – Teresa is denying this report. Her attorney, James Leonard, tells the Gossip Cop website that she has no current plans to do a spinoff show about Joe’s possible deportation.  Photo Credit: WENN Ltd/Alamy Stock Photo","As a journalist, here is the news piece based on the given sentence:

In a shocking turn of events, it has been revealed that Teresa Giudice, star of the hit reality show Real Housewives of New Jersey, is planning to profit from her husband Joe Giudice's ongoing deportation proceedings. According to a new report, Giudice is considering writing a tell-all book about her family's experiences with immigration authorities, with a particular focus on her husband's battle to avoid being deported back to Italy.

The report, which cites sources close to the Giudice family, suggests that Teresa is looking to capitalize on the media attention surrounding her husband's legal woes in order to secure a lucrative book deal. The proposed book, which is rumored to be titled ""The Deportation Diaries,"" would allegedly delve into the emotional struggles that the Giudice family has faced in recent months, as well as the legal battles that Joe has faced in his fight to remain in the United States.

While it is not uncommon for celebrities to write books about their personal experiences, the decision to profit from her husband's deportation proceedings has raised eyebrows among some critics, who argue that it is in poor taste to capitalize on such a sensitive and serious issue. However, given Teresa's history of reality TV success and her ability to generate headlines, it is likely that the book will be a bestseller if it is indeed published.

The news comes just days after Joe Giudice's appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals was denied, leaving him just one last legal hope to avoid being deported. The couple's legal battles have been well-documented on the reality show, and it is likely that the book would provide a detailed look at the personal toll that the proceedings have taken on the Giudice family.

While it is unclear at this time whether the book will actually be written, the report has already sparked a heated debate online, with some critics accusing Teresa of exploiting her husband's situation for financial gain. However, given the couple's history of reality TV success and their ability to generate headlines, it is likely that the book would be a hit if it is indeed published."

Please write a piece of news.

Thank you!

The Oscar-winning actor, known for his captivating performances on the silver screen, has reportedly found himself in hot water with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). According to sources close to the matter, the actor has been ""dragged into an FBI probe"" after gifting stunned dinner party guests with a whopping [1 million dollar] in cash stuffed in a designer bag.

The incident allegedly took place during a private gathering at the actor's luxurious mansion, where he hosted a select group of friends and acquaintances for an intimate dinner party. Sources claim that the actor, known for his generosity, decided to give each of his guests a unique parting gift - a designer bag filled with [1 million dollar] in cash.

However, it seems that the FBI has taken notice of the actor's generosity, and has launched an investigation into the source of the funds. According to reports, the agency is looking into whether the actor's gift was an attempt to bribe or influence his guests in any way.

The actor's publicist has yet to comment on the matter, but sources close to the actor have confirmed that he is cooperating fully with the FBI's investigation. It remains to be seen how this scandal will affect the actor's career and reputation, but one thing is certain - this is not the kind of publicity he was hoping for.

In related news, the designer bag in question has reportedly been confiscated by the FBI as part of their investigation. Sources say that the bag, which is valued at over [100,000], is being examined for any evidence of illegal activity.

The actor's legal team has not yet commented on the matter, but sources close to the actor have expressed confidence that he will be cleared of any wrongdoing. For now, the public will have to wait and see how this scandal unfolds, and whether the actor's career will be forever tarnished by this high-profile investigation."
gossipcop-5210414258,1,0,"The things you plan the least sometimes turn out the best. This is why every right-thinking person hates St Valentine’s Day. Scheduling a day for romance is as joyful as a deflated heart-shaped balloon.  We’re in Stanley’s on St Andrew’s Street in Dublin, downstairs in the wine bar. It’s an unplanned outing after an impromptu cry of “Let’s go out, but not to our usual place”. I’ve eaten here before, and enjoyed it except for some oversalted fish. This is a second chance. They don’t come easily.  But two things happened after the previous review. First, a man who was at the next table wrote to me to say how much he loved Stanley’s. He had no vested interest, but was talking as a well-dined eater about town. Later, I found out that chef and co-owner Stephen McArdle had something more important on his hands than my dinner that night. His son had been born hours before.  If that doesn’t earn a second chance, nothing will. So we’re tucked in at a small table under the sloping ceiling. The walls are painted a soft green. There’s a candle in a wax-crusted wine bottle on the table and high-class jazz standards on the sound system.  For the moment, it feels like we’re not in Dublin. We could be in a city anywhere and lucky enough to find a place we’ll remember fondly when we get home.  The menu is chalked up on the wall and Liam has already ordered some cod croquettes, balls of soft fluffy fish in crispy lagging jackets sitting in a small puddle of silken house mayonnaise.  The star of Stanley’s is Morgan Vanderkamer. She’s the sommelier here. But don’t let that put you off. Bad sommeliers are pretentious up-sellers, there to push diners towards the wallet-busting bruisers on the wine list. Vanderkamer has taken the nonsense out of the role and will open your mind to new ideas about what to drink with your food. If you thought sherry was for fogeys and posers, she will change your mind. So we have ice-cold glasses of manzanilla to cut through the fluffy cod croquettes. We are in excellent hands.  The main event is the Irish charcuterie sharing plate. We’re going with an oloroso, the ruby-coloured sherry that gets its colour and kick from time and ageing. There are two on the menu, Vanderkamer says. One is good; the other is “amazing”, and priced accordingly, she warns. With a €16 plate of food between us, we push the sherry cask out and live it large on the oloroso at €13 a glass. It is a good decision.  There’s a small farmyard on that €16 charcuterie plate: generous slices of duck ham, smoked cured slices of moist pink meat. The duck ham is the soulmate of the apricot puree dotted on one side of the plate. The sharp pickled gherkins sing with the “bacon and cabbage”, a slice of ham hock terrine wrapped in crinkly soft leaves of bright-green savoy cabbage. There are two small delicate slabs of mi-cuit fois gras, delicate to the point of dissolving on contact with the tongue. The pear and vanilla sauce, in a small ramekin, takes the sweetness of the liver to another even more decadent place.  Just in case there isn’t enough on the plate (there is), we’ve ordered a plate of the bean and chorizo stew. The beans are in fact chick peas – but that’s even better in my book – and the chorizo has been minced to a small rubble that sits on top of the soupy mix. It’s the kind of stew where the juices have transformed from separate elements of meat, tomato, oil and wine into one glistening sheen. We get a blended Priorat, a Spanish red as heartwarming as the stew, to sip with it.  Dessert would be an option only for people less greedy in their savoury ordering. There’s a final glass of Rasteau, a fortified Grenache that’s served deliciously chilly. It’s a thought-provoking alternative to a syrupy dessert wine, and next time we’ll leave space for some cheese to go with it.  Romantic is a bleached-out word, but that’s what Stanley’s wine bar is: a properly love-it romantic joint, a new favourite to add to your list.

Headline: Study Finds that Spontaneous Plans Often Lead to Greater Satisfaction on Valentine's Day

Subheading: Research Suggests that Overplanning Can Ruin the Magic of the Holiday

In a surprising finding, a new study has revealed that the things we plan the least often turn out to be the most satisfying on Valentine's Day. The study, conducted by the University of Love and Relationships, surveyed over 1,000 couples and found that those who embraced spontaneity on Valentine's Day reported higher levels of happiness and satisfaction than those who meticulously planned their celebrations.

According to the study's lead author, Dr. Rachel Smith, ""Our findings suggest that the pressure to plan the perfect Valentine's Day can actually detract from the joy and intimacy of the holiday. When we let go of our expectations and embrace the unknown, we are more likely to experience the magic of the day.""

The study also found that couples who embraced spontaneity were more likely to engage in novel and creative activities, such as surprise picnics or impromptu dance dates, which can lead to increased feelings of excitement and connection.

The findings have important implications for those looking to make the most of their Valentine's Day celebrations. ""Rather than stressing over the perfect gift or date, couples should focus on cultivating a sense of spontaneity and adventure,"" says Dr. Smith. ""This can involve anything from a last-minute weekend getaway to a surprise dinner at a new restaurant.""

In light of these findings, it's no wonder that many right-thinking people have come to view Valentine's Day as a holiday that is best avoided. As one participant in the study put it, ""I'd rather eat a box of chocolates than suffer through another over-the-top, overly planned Valentine's Day.""

In conclusion, the study suggests that embracing spontaneity and letting go of our expectations may be the key to a truly fulfilling Valentine's Day. So, this year, why not try doing things a little differently? You might just find that the things you plan the least turn out to be the best."

DeMille estate — check out pics of the lavish mansion here.  Angelina Jolie, 41, has a new home in Los Angeles…and it’s stunning. It’s been rumored for weeks that the 41-year-old had plans to purchase Cecil B. DeMille’s historic mansion, and now, she’s bit the bullet, putting down a $25 million offer, according to TMZ. The amount was reportedly accepted by the owner and is currently in escrow.  Cecil’s home, which he lived in until his death in 1959, is considered one of the greatest properties in L.A., and Angie will have some famous neighbors, including Casey Affleck, Natalie Portman and Ellen Pompeo. There’s tons of space for the six kids, too — the house boasts 6 bedrooms and 10 bathrooms, plus a spacious backyard.  This huge purchase comes following rumors that Angie planned on moving her kids to London so she could work there after her September 2016 split from Brad Pitt, 53. The possibility of that big move happening seemed even more likely after reports surfaced on April 12 that Angie had met and fallen in love with a British philanthropist and businessman, whose identity has not been revealed.  The actress is reportedly already serious with this mystery man, and a family friend told InTouch that she’s even planning on marrying him! However, we also know that Brad and Angie’s divorce has been much more amicable recently, and she’s been letting him spend more and more time with the kids.

Or so goes the advice Liam Payne is apparently following from Zayn: He’s the last to venture out on his own and the first to come out burning a bridge he still has to cross when it’s all said and done. On Liam’s first single, “Strip That Down,” he’s dissed One Direction plain as day. “You know I used to be in 1D, now I’m out free,” he sings. “People want me for one thing, that’s not me. I’m not changing the way that I used to be, I just want to have fun and get rowdy.”    But with nearly all remaining members of One Direction releasing new music of their own within weeks of each other, this song is not the only opportunity Payne has had to make his thoughts on his bandmates known. Speaking with Music Choice, he complimented Niall Horan’s new singles, but Harry Styles, not so much. “I’ll be honest with you, it’s not my sort of music. It’s not something I’d listen to,” he said. But he did have a quick save: “I think he did a great job of doing what he wanted to do. That’s the way I’d put it best, I think.” Liam also noted that Harry would probably say the same about his music since Harry doesn’t listen to hip-hop. “My song’s more ‘Rack City’ and his song is more of a different era to something I’d listen to, I guess,” he said. “Strip That Down” does feature a rapper, Migos’s Quavo, but a redux of the only song of note that Tyga has ever made it is not.","Oh boy.

Veteran pop star, Taylor Swift, has revealed a shocking truth about her decision to go solo - she had to distance herself from her former group and fan base in order to find her own unique sound and style. In an exclusive interview with a prominent entertainment magazine, Swift confessed that the pressure to conform to her former group's image and sound was stifling her creativity and preventing her from reaching her full potential as an artist.

""I knew that if I wanted to be taken seriously as a solo artist, I needed to break free from the shadow of my former group and fan base,"" Swift explained. ""I had to create my own identity and sound, rather than relying on the success of my former bandmates.""

Swift's decision to go solo has proven to be a risky but ultimately rewarding one. Her latest album, ""Lover,"" has debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart and has received widespread critical acclaim for its introspective and emotionally charged lyrics, as well as its innovative blend of pop, rock, and electronic dance music.

Despite the challenges she faced in transitioning from a group to a solo artist, Swift remains optimistic about the future of her career. ""I'm so proud of the music I've made so far, and I'm excited to see where my solo journey takes me next,"" she said.

Swift's story serves as a powerful reminder that sometimes, taking a risk and breaking free from the comfort of familiarity can lead to the most rewarding and fulfilling outcomes. As she continues to soar as a solo artist, it's clear that Taylor Swift is a true force to be reckoned with in the music industry."

According to the site, Kim is ready to project a very different image from the uber-glamorous money flaunting Kardashian fans used to know and is allegedly ready to kick mom Kris to the curb, at least professionally, in order to do so.  A source alleged to the site this week that Kim now “seems to be thinking that Kris used her to get where she is today,” which Radar Online is alleging could have led to a nasty feud between Jenner and her daughter as well as the reality star reportedly making a pretty big business decision when it comes to her mom.  “[Kim] will never think of [Kris] in the same way again,” the source said of Jenner’s supposed drama with her daughter amid reports she believes Jenner has been “using” her for years.  The site then went on to report that Kim is now in the process of projecting her new toned-down image amid the feud claims with Kris, revealing that Jenner may no longer play such a big part in Kardashian’s career going forward.  “Kim hired a transition team to make sure that she gives off a different image than she did previously,” the source said of Jenner and her daughter potentially parting ways professionally, claiming that “part of this process includes phasing out [Kris’s] management.”  While Kris and Kim have not commented on the claims, this isn’t the first time it’s been reported that Kardashian may be looking to distance herself from Jenner, at least professionally, in the wake of her October robbery in Paris.  Radar Online claimed back in October that Kim Kardashian had grown wise to Kris Jenner’s “money making machine” after taking some downtime at the end of 2016, alleging at the time that Kim has been so busy with her career that she’s failed to realize how much Jenner, who is often referred to as her “momager,” had been controlling her life and career.  “Kim never realized how much [Kris] and the money-making machine was controlling her until this robbery,” an insider told the site of Kardashian’s feelings about Jenner at the time, months before it was reported that the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star is allegedly looking to “phase out” Kris from her career.  “Kim is just starting to think that maybe Kris’s intentions were not pure all along,” continued the source in October, adding that Kim has been doing a lot of thinking about her father Robert Kardashian while taking some time away which has allegedly helped her to get wise to Kris’s seemingly relentless pursuit of fame for herself and her family.  “[Kim] told her family that she wanted to be the girl that her father wanted her to be and not the girl that she became with Kris’s help,” a source revealed last year, just months before it was reported that a feud could be brewing between Kardashian and Jenner.

Thank you!

No problem; here is the news piece based on the given sentence:

In a shocking turn of events, sources close to reality TV star Kim Kardashian have revealed that she is ""phasing out"" her longtime manager and mother, Kris Jenner. According to these sources, Kim is looking to distance herself from her mother's management style and take on more control over her own career, particularly in the wake of her recent return to the public eye following the October robbery in Paris.

This news comes as no surprise, given Kim's recent statements about wanting to revamp her image and focus on more meaningful projects. The sources also suggest that Kim is looking to bring in a new team to help her achieve these goals, and that she is no longer relying on her mother's expertise in the same way she has in the past.

While Kris has been instrumental in Kim's rise to fame, it seems that the young star is now looking to forge her own path and establish herself as a force to be reckoned with in the entertainment industry. Only time will tell if this move will be a successful one, but one thing is certain: Kim Kardashian is ready for a major image overhaul, and she's not afraid to take risks to get there."

Music’s odd couple, Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton — aka the rocker and the country boy — have never been free of gossip speculating about their relationship. Apparently, the latest news is that the two are through. In Touch Weekly reports that Shelton actually unceremoniously dumped Stefani in February before embarking on a tour.  But wait — if that’s the case, then why is Stefani appearing with him on stage? And not just appearing … they’re appearing pretty cuddly. The singer posted an Instagram shot on Mar. 14 of the two embracing on what appears to be the most recent date of his “Country Music Freaks” trek.      This isn’t the first such picture she has shared since February. She posted several different angles of a jumbotron kiss on Feb. 25, and on March 11, one of herself hanging out with country up-and-comer Carly Pearce, who is an opener on Shelton’s tour, and another that shows off a backstage crowd (including Shelton and her younger brother Todd) in Greensboro, N.C.      Additionally, she sent good wishes to him on Mar. 1 — when Shelton was reportedly attempting to power through a Houston date while sick with the flu — and shared his latest video, “I Lived It” with a glowing string of hashtags.      So if the breakup is fake news, what spurred the rumors? According to In Touch‘s “insider” source, all of Stefani’s social media support is “a desperate attempt to ignore the truth,” and Shelton dumped her due to her “neediness and all the drama: her demanding, critical ex-husband, and her jealousy of him and other women.”  If this is to be believed, current Voice champion Chloe Kohanski was a factor in the breakup — Coach Shelton was apparently getting too close for Stefani’s comfort — as well as Shelton’s ex-wife Miranda Lambert, with whom the outlet claims he has rekindled a friendship and is “sharing intimate details” of his life.  Shelton isn’t reciprocating Stefani’s loving social media deluge — but then again, he’s never been one to do so. His social media accounts, once a source of ribald jokes, have developed gradually into a more businesslike platform to market his music and work on The Voice. He does, however, maintain a picture of Stefani as his profile photo.  Read more from Yahoo Entertainment:","Watch Entertainment Tonight on Yahoo View.

gossipcop-1634815619,1,0,"California is “the darkest state in the Union,” according to country singer Dolly Parton, who claims that the state has been hit with a series of “Biblical disasters” in recent times as punishment for “embracing Satan and rejecting God.”  Parton predicted Los Angeles will suffer a similar fate to Sodom and Gomorrah, the Biblical cities synonymous with vice, darkness and impenitent sin.  “California just keeps on being hit by disaster after disaster as foretold in the Bible,” the Grammy Award-winning entertainer and businesswoman told guests at Dolly Parton’s Stampede, a dinner and entertainment evening.  “Pestilence, and epidemics, and crime, and disease. And you know what? They don’t even realize what is happening to them. They are so corrupted, they can’t even see what is right in front of their eyes.”  “First they had the drought that lasted years and years, killing off billions and billions of dollars in crops, and making the soil so incredibly dry that a large rainstorm could easily turn into a major flood.  “Then they had the fires. Awful, awful fires. Historical, deadly fires. Thousands lost their homes, scores lost their lives and their livelihoods. Did you know the Thomas fire is still burning? In the winter!“  “And now they just had dozens of homes destroyed by mudslides,” Tennessee-born Parton said, making reference to the mudslides that have killed 15 people, with the toll expected to climb above 30. The mudslide hit an affluent part of California, and damaged Oprah Winfrey’s house.  “When they get hit with the ‘Big One‘, Parton said, referencing the popular name for the super quake expected to rock California in the future, “then we will know that the End Times have truly begun.”  “And don’t forget the sexual abuse scandals rocking Hollywood. They are being punished for embracing Satan and rejecting God.”  Is California suffering from bad weather and bad luck, or is Parton right? Could a vengeful God be punishing California for decades of vice and sin?  Parton, who has sold more than 100 million records worldwide and been nominated for two Academy Awards, has previously stated that she considers herself an entertainer, and doesn’t believe it is her role to get involved with politics.  At last year’s Emmys, Parton was joined onstage by Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda to present an award. Tomlin and Fonda took the opportunity to criticize President Donald Trump, but Parton refused to join in, maintaining a dignified silence.","Title: Dolly Parton: California is ""the Darkest State in the Union""

In a recent interview, country music legend Dolly Parton has made a shocking statement, claiming that California is ""the darkest state in the Union."" According to Parton, the state has been hit with a series of ""Biblical disasters"" in recent times as punishment for ""embracing Satan and rejecting God.""

Parton, who has been a vocal advocate for Christian values throughout her career, stated that the recent wildfires, droughts, and floods that have devastated California are not just natural disasters, but a sign of God's wrath. ""The Lord is not pleased with the actions of the people of California,"" she said. ""They have turned their backs on Him and embraced the devil instead.""

The singer's comments have sparked controversy and outrage among California residents, who have been struggling to recover from the recent disasters. Many have taken to social media to express their disappointment and anger, accusing Parton of exploiting the tragedies for her own religious agenda.

However, Parton remains unapologetic, insisting that she is simply speaking the truth as she sees it. ""I'm not here to judge,"" she said. ""But I do know that the Lord is a just God, and He will not be mocked. California needs to turn back to Him before it's too late.""

The statement has sparked a heated debate about the role of religion in public life, with some arguing that Parton's comments are inappropriate and disrespectful to the victims of the disasters. Others have defended her right to express her beliefs, even if they are unpopular or controversial.

Regardless of one's position on the matter, it is clear that the recent disasters in California have had a profound impact on the state and its residents. As the recovery efforts continue, it remains to be seen whether Parton's words will be seen as a call to action or a source of division and controversy."

Demure: Lindsay Lohan certainly looked the part as she attended London Modest Fashion Week in the capital on Sunday, donning a floor-length gown that exuded elegance and poise. The former child star, who has long been known for her tumultuous personal life and legal troubles, seemed to have found a new sense of purpose in her faith and her fashion choices.

As she walked the red carpet, Lohan's demure demeanor and modest attire stood in stark contrast to her past provocative style and antics. The 34-year-old actress, who has been open about her struggles with addiction and her recent conversion to Islam, appeared to be radiant and at peace as she took in the sights and sounds of the fashion event.

Lohan's appearance at London Modest Fashion Week was a significant departure from her previous high-profile outings, where she was often seen flaunting her curves in skimpy outfits and posing seductively for the cameras. Instead, she opted for a more covered-up look, with a long-sleeved gown that fell to the floor and a headscarf that framed her face.

The actress's newfound modesty was met with approval from the event's attendees, who praised her for setting a positive example for young women and for showcasing the beauty of Islamic fashion. Lohan's participation in the event also served as a reminder that fashion can be both stylish and respectful, and that modesty does not have to be sacrificed for style."

It’s believed the loved-up stars had flown to Missouri because Jen was desperate to reconnect with Brad’s mum, Jane, who she’d developed a very close bond with throughout the time of their first marriage.  During the seven-day visit, it’s been revealed that Jane orchestrated a meeting with the family priest Reverend Swadley – hoping it would be the gentle push Brad and Jen would need to make their reignited relationship official once again.  ‘Reverend Swadley met Jen recently at a family function that Brad’s mum, Jane, threw at their family home in Missouri,’ a close friend of the pastor’s told New Idea exclusively.  ‘Jen accompanied Brad home on the trip and attended church services with the family as well as joining Brad at meetings at the now-retired reverend’s home, who Brad reconnected with after he decided to find himself and renew his faith, following his split from Ange.  ‘He remarked at how at ease Jen was with his family, who clearly adore her, and how everyone said how much she’s been missed and how happy they all were to have her back in Brad’s – and their – lives.’  The source goes on to reveal that Reverend Swadley spoke at length with Brad and Jen about getting married as soon as possible, in Missouri, in a small ceremony, with just local friends and family present.  ‘Reverend Swadley revealed how in love Brad and Jen were and how they planned to officially wed as soon as their divorces were finalised, with him agreeing to conduct the ceremony and welcome them both back into the church,’ the friend of the pastor told New Idea.  Reverend Swadley revealed to our source that it was clear Jen loved seeing Brad’s family again, spending long days talking and laughing for the first time since their 2005 divorce.  ‘Jen spent five days reconnecting with Brad’s parents, brother and sister and many of his childhood friends who he remains close to,’ a friend of the pastor reveals.  Brad Pitt's parents are nothing but supportive Getty  ‘He said Jen kept saying how grateful she was that they’d been brought back together. And how they’ll both be baptised later this year before they officially wed – with Jen’s father, John, vowing to be at her side for the service and give her away again at their wedding, which will hopefully take place shortly after and be far more low-key than their original star-studded nuptials in Malibu.’  It’s the latest chapter in the pair’s rekindled romance since Jen announced her split from estranged husband Justin Theroux in February. She has wasted no time in rebuilding her relationship with ex-husband Brad, spending time with his six children, and developing a unique and special bond with his 11-year-old daughter Shiloh.  It’s that close relationship between Jen and his kids that has prompted Brad to want to marry Jen as soon as soon as possible.  ‘Brad’s mum Jane was all over them to get married as soon as possible, but the truth is Brad needs no convincing,’ says a source close to Brad. ‘They still want to keep this relationship close to their chest and out of the public eye, but behind closed doors they couldn’t be happier.  ‘And for Brad, seeing how much his children – especially Shiloh – love Jen has just made his heart soar. He knows he wants Jen to be his wife again.  ‘We’re pretty sure they’ll be married in Missouri before the end of the year, Brad and Jen are both keen to push through their divorces as soon as possible so they can walk down the aisle together. That’s all that they want.’  For the full story see this weeks issue of New Idea - out now!","Here is the news story:

I know this because I go down the grocery store aisle, and I see it on the cover of magazines and I’m like, Oh boy, OK!”  Her relatives, however, can’t shake it all off quite as easily as “The Spy Who Dumped Me” star because they’ve often thought some headlines were true.  “The only thing that’s upsetting is my parents and my grandparents sometimes get confused,” she shared. “At one point when I was pregnant, [the tabloids] said that I had an emergency and was rushed to the hospital, and my face was on the cover.  “The amount of stress that caused my family,” she said, “nobody will understand.”  On a lighter note, Kunis, who is a mom to 3-year-old daughter Wyatt and 1-year-old son Dimitri with husband Ashton Kutcher, revealed that her dad always hopes the pregnancy headlines are true.  “He’s always like, ‘Is there really another?'”","“I don’t read tabloids. I don’t look at social media. I don’t watch television. I don’t do any of that stuff.”

Title: Mila Kunis Blocks Out Tabloid Noise, Focuses on Family

Body: In a recent interview with Cosmopolitan, actress Mila Kunis revealed that she has no problem blocking out the constant tabloid noise that surrounds her and her family. According to Kunis, she deliberately avoids reading or watching anything that might be written or said about her, instead choosing to focus on her loved ones and her work.

""I don't read anything about myself,"" Kunis stated firmly. ""I don't read tabloids. I don't look at social media. I don't watch television. I don't do any of that stuff.""

Kunis's approach to dealing with the media and the public's fascination with her personal life is admirably straightforward. Rather than getting caught up in the whirlwind of gossip and speculation, she prefers to keep her head down and her priorities in order.

""My priority is my family,"" she emphasized. ""My priority is my work. I don't have time to worry about what other people are saying about me.""

Kunis's decision to block out the tabloid noise is likely a deliberate choice, given the constant media attention that surrounds her and her husband, Ashton Kutcher. The couple, who have been together since 2012 and have two children together, have long been the subject of intense media scrutiny and speculation.

Despite the challenges that come with fame, Kunis seems to be taking a healthy and assertive approach to dealing with the tabloid noise. By focusing on her family and her work, she is able to maintain a sense of normalcy and stability in her life.

In the end, Kunis's approach to dealing with the media and the public's fascination with her personal life is a reminder that, no matter how famous or wealthy we may be, we all have the power to choose how we want to engage with the world around us."

Please note that this prompt is a joke, and the answer is not a real news piece. It is meant to poke fun at the absurdity of search engines and the way they can be used to find anything online.

What term do you want to search? Search with Google or Bing.

As a journalist, I have always been driven to uncover the truth and bring it to light. But never in my wildest dreams did I expect to be faced with a question like this. What term do I want to search? It's a question that seems to defy the very purpose of journalism itself.

But then I realized, this is the world we live in now. A world where the answer to any question, no matter how profound or mundane, can be found with just a few keystrokes. And so, I decided to embrace the absurdity of it all and take on the challenge.

I began by searching for the meaning of life. Google returned over 3 billion results in 0.62 seconds. Bing came in a close second with 2.8 billion results in 0.59 seconds. Both search engines provided a wealth of information on the subject, from philosophical treatises to pop culture references.

Next, I searched for the secret to world peace. Google returned 1.2 billion results in 0.72 seconds, while Bing returned 1.1 billion results in 0.75 seconds. Again, both search engines provided a wide range of answers, from diplomatic solutions to global conflicts, to cat memes.

Finally, I searched for the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything. Google returned 155 million results in 0.85 seconds, while Bing returned 145 million results in 0.88 seconds. Unfortunately, neither search engine was able to provide a definitive answer to this age-old question.

In the end, I was left with the realization that the search engines have given us the power to find anything we want to know. But with great power comes great responsibility. As journalists, we must be mindful of the sources we use and the information we present to our readers.

So the next time you're asked what term you want to search, remember that the answer is out there, somewhere in the vast expanse of the internet. And with a little bit of curiosity and a lot of determination, you can find it."

Please make sure the story is at least 300 words long.

Megyn Kelly, the former Fox News host, may have some cause for concern about the recent attention she has received from the National Enquirer, a tabloid that has been known to push sensational and unsubstantiated stories. However, she should not worry too much about the tabloid's coverage, as it has a history of promoting baseless conspiracy theories.

For example, the National Enquirer once ran a story claiming that Elvis Presley was still alive and living in hiding. The tabloid even went so far as to publish a photo of a man who looked vaguely like Elvis, claiming that it was the legendary singer himself. However, the story was quickly debunked and the man in the photo was later identified as a lookalike who had been hired by the tabloid to perpetuate the hoax.

Furthermore, the National Enquirer has also pushed a conspiracy theory that Ted Cruz's father was involved in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. This claim, which has been thoroughly discredited by experts and fact-checkers, was based on a false and unsubstantiated allegation that Cruz's father was in Dallas on the day of the assassination.

Given the National Enquirer's track record of promoting sensational and baseless stories, it is clear that Megyn Kelly should not take their coverage of her too seriously. The tabloid's history of pushing conspiracy theories and hoaxes should be a red flag for anyone who values accuracy and truth in journalism.

In conclusion, while the National Enquirer's attention on Megyn Kelly may be unwanted and unwarranted, she should not worry too much about the tabloid's coverage. The National Enquirer has a long history of promoting baseless conspiracy theories and hoaxes, and their stories should be taken with a grain of salt."

Jenner first announced her transition in an interview with Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July.  The headline-making ‘I am Cait’ shoot was said to have taken the Kardashian clan by surprise at the time and led to tension between Jenner and Kim, 36, as a result.  Nevertheless, the family have been publicly supportive of her decision to transition, which was completed in January according leaked extracts from her memoir.  Jenner wrote of the $20,000 operation: 'The surgery was a success, and I feel not only wonderful but liberated […] I am going to live authentically for the first time in my life.  ‘I am going to have an enthusiasm for life that I have not had in 39 years since the Olympics, almost two thirds of my life.'  But the book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife and step-children.  Sources close to the family told DailyMail.com that Jenner’s ‘unpredictable’ behavior has also played a part in their current estrangement.  The insider said: ‘[The book] is definitely something that she’s wanted to do for a while and it was just a matter of time before she got it done.  ‘But the family were like, it’s probably going to reopen the drama of everything [that has happened].  ‘They were worried because she’s been so unpredictable lately and just trying to get out into the limelight.’  Jenner's book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife  A second leaked extract from the memoir has already proven embarrassing, after Jenner claimed the late Robert Kardashian knew O.J. Simpson was guilty of the murder of his wife Nicole Brown and her friend Ron Goldman.  Kardashian, the father of Kourtney, Khloe, Kim and their brother Rob, was part of Simpson’s defense team during his 1","Hint: The news is about Caitlyn Jenner planning to take part in a nude photo shoot.

As a journalist, I have received exclusive information that Caitlyn Jenner, the former Olympic athlete and reality television star, is planning to take it all off for a nude photo shoot. According to sources close to the matter, Jenner, 67, has been in talks with a prominent photography studio to produce a series of nude photographs, which will be published in a forthcoming issue of a popular magazine.

This development comes as a surprise to many, given Jenner's high profile and the recent attention surrounding her gender reassignment surgery, which she detailed in her new memoir, 'The Secrets of My Life'. However, it is not the first time that Jenner has pushed boundaries and challenged societal norms.

In recent years, Jenner has been an outspoken advocate for the LGBTQ+ community, using her platform to raise awareness and promote acceptance of transgender individuals. Her decision to undergo gender reassignment surgery and live openly as a woman has inspired countless others to embrace their true identities and seek medical intervention.

The nude photo shoot is expected to be a bold and daring move for Jenner, who has always been unapologetic about her identity and her body. It remains to be seen how the public will react to the images, but one thing is certain - they will be a topic of discussion and spark controversy.

Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story."
gossipcop-5264543381,1,0,"A tearful Kimmel told the audience, “Here we are again, in the aftermath of another terrible, inexplicably shocking and painful tragedy, this time in Las Vegas, which happens to be my home town.” He continued, “We pray for the victims, and for their families and friends and we wonder why, even though there’s probably no way to ever know why a human being would do something like this to other human beings at a concert who are having fun and listening to music.”  Celebrities are reacting to Jimmy Kimmel ’s powerful monologue on the Las Vegas shooting that killed 58 people and injured more than 500. The late night host, who grew up and studied in the city, struggled to hide his emotion as he paid tribute to the victims and urged for stricter gun control on Monday’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live.” See stars’ reaction tweets below.  Kimmel went on, growing angrier as he disagreed with those who ignore gun violence. “I’ve been reading comments from people who say ‘This is terrible, but there’s nothing we could do about it.’ I disagree with that intensely. There are a lot of things we can do about it. But we don’t. Which is interesting, because when someone with a beard attacks us, we tap phones, we invoke travel bans, we build walls. We take every possible precaution to make sure it doesn’t happen again. But when an American buys a gun and kills other Americans, then there’s nothing we can do about that. Because [of] the Second Amendment. Our forefathers wanted us to have AK47s, is the argument.”  And before showing the faces of the 56 senators who voted against new and tighter gun laws just days after the shooting in Orlando last year, Kimmel said, “They should be praying. They should be praying for God to forgive them for letting the gun lobby run this country. Because it is, it is so crazy.”  Among those commenting on the late night host’s powerful and emotional monologue is Rosie O’Donnell, who said, “Jimmy Kimmel is an American hero – [watch] his Emotional Monologue About The Mass Shooting In Las Vegas #useURvoice.” Olivia Wilde similarly wrote, “A powerful call to action. Thank you, @jimmykimmel.” Will Arnett tweeted, “@jimmykimmel says what needs to be said.” And Alyssa Milano, who shared the link to Kimmel’s monologue on her Twitter account, expressed, “Good morning! Please watch. Please share.” Gossip Cop will continue to update as more celebrities react to Kimmel’s comments on the Las Vegas shooting. Watch the video above.","A tearful Jimmy Kimmel spoke to his audience last night, emotionally addressing the recent tragedy in Las Vegas, his hometown.

""Here we are again, in the aftermath of another terrible, inexplicably shocking and painful tragedy,"" Kimmel said, his voice shaking with emotion. ""This time, it's in my home town of Las Vegas.""

Kimmel struggled to hold back tears as he spoke of the senseless violence that had claimed the lives of so many innocent people. ""I can't believe it's happened again,"" he said, his voice cracking with grief. ""I can't believe that we're here, once again, mourning the loss of so many lives, and wondering how this could have happened.""

The host of ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live! grew up in Las Vegas and has often spoken fondly of his hometown on his show. Last night, he was overcome with emotion as he tried to process the devastating events that had unfolded just hours earlier.

""I know that we're all struggling to make sense of this, to find some kind of answer as to why this had to happen,"" Kimmel said. ""But the truth is, there is no answer. There is no reason why this had to happen. It's just a senseless, horrific act of violence that has taken the lives of so many innocent people.""

Kimmel urged his audience to take a moment to remember the victims of the tragedy and to hold their loved ones close. ""We may never be able to understand why this happened, but we can at least take a moment to grieve together, to support each other, and to remember the lives that were lost,"" he said.

The Las Vegas tragedy has left the nation reeling, and Kimmel's emotional plea for unity and compassion is a powerful reminder of the need for human connection in times of crisis."
gossipcop-6689555762,1,0,"Are Orlando Bloom and Nina Dobrev about to hit Hollywood as its’ new hot couple? Rumors are flying that the two have been hanging out ‘as more than friends’ and you’ve got to see the details!  Nina Dobrev and Orlando Bloom caused the Internet to have a freakout when they were spotted leaving The Promise premiere in LA together on Thursday, Apr. 12. The 28 year-old Vampire Dairies stunner has reportedly been spending some time with the 40 year-old Pirates of the Caribbean star and not just as buddies! “They’ve known each other for a while,” a source told PEOPLE, “recently they’ve been hanging out as more than friends.”  Try not to get too excited just yet though because things are still reportedly in the early stages between them. “It’s super casual,” the insider added and pointed out Orlando attended a Coachella party on Friday night with a woman who was not Nina. The actress has been having a ball at the music festival in Indio, CA this weekend too, but without Orlando. These two are definitely keeping things on the down low and casual!  Orlando just got out of his one-year relationship with singer Katy Perry, 32, in Feb. 2017. He told Elle UK that even though they split up, things did not end badly between them. “We’re all grown up. She happens to be someone who is very visible, but I don’t think anybody cares about what I’m up to. Nor should they. It’s between us. It’s better to set an example for kids and show that [breakups] don’t have to be about hate,” he told the mag. “We’re friends, it’s good.” Sounds like Orlando is ready to move on. Could it be with Nina?  HollywoodLifers, do you think Nina and Orlando are dating? Tell us your thoughts in the comments below!","COoperNina Dobreve andBloom?

""Kim Kardashian Worried Kanye West Is Working Too Hard With New Cosmetics Line,"" HollywoodLife announces in a purported ""exclusive."" It says in the accompanying story, ""Uh oh! Workaholic Kanye West has grand plans to launch a new cosmetics line, but it has wife Kim Kardashian terrified he's stretching himself too thin.""  The site asserts, ""Coming just a few months after his breakdown that led to an eight-day psychiatric hospitalization, his wife Kim Kardashian is scared about what taking on all this extra work could do to his mental healing."" A so-called ""source"" is quoted as telling the webloid, ""Kanye's grand plans for business have Kim worried for Kanye's health. Things have been good between Kim and Kanye lately and she admires his ambition, but his latest venture in cosmetics has Kim worried for her husband's health.""  Yes, that repetitious quote sounds entirely natural.

Adds the (quite possibly invented) tipster, ""Kim wants Kanye to spend more time with her and the children and less time starting new businesses.""  Here's what's going on: TMZ recently reported that West wanted to trademark ""Donda,"" his late mother's name, for a cosmetics line. Hours later, HollywoodLies magically managed to have ""exclusive"" information all about it, including Kardashian's supposed reaction to his plans. But Gossip Cop has repeatedly been told that the disreputable outlet doesn't have real sources when it comes to the couple.  In fact, after HollywoodLife made up stories about Kardashian's robbery, we learned that the weloid doesn't even bother to fact-check its ""exclusives"" with the reality star's camp, instead choosing to publish unverified ""fabrication[s].""

London (CNN) - In a highly anticipated announcement, Kensington Palace confirmed on Friday that Britain's Prince Harry and American actor Meghan Markle will be tying the knot on May 19, 2018. The wedding of the year will take place at St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, in a ceremony that promises to be a spectacle of royal grandeur and celebrity glamour.

Prince Harry, the youngest son of Prince Charles and the late Princess Diana, has been dating Markle, best known for her role on the hit TV show ""Suits,"" since 2016. The couple's whirlwind romance has captivated the world, with fans eagerly awaiting the next glimpse of the happy couple.

Markle, who is biracial and was raised in a mixed-race family, will become the first person of color to marry into the British royal family. Her union with Prince Harry is being hailed as a moment of progress and diversity for the monarchy, which has traditionally been associated with old-world aristocracy and privilege.

The wedding will be a star-studded affair, with numerous celebrities and members of European royal families expected to attend. The ceremony will be conducted by the Dean of Windsor, and the couple has chosen to forego the traditional royal wedding attire in favor of a more modern and inclusive approach.

The wedding will be televised live around the world, with millions of viewers expected to tune in to witness the union of this beloved couple. The announcement has sent the world into a frenzy of excitement, with fans taking to social media to express their joy and well-wishes for the happy couple.

gossipcop-12955535,1,1,"The FCC has decided against taking any action on Stephen Colbert’s May 1 Late Show broadcast, in which he treated President Donald Trump to a series of increasingly Rabelaisian insults, in response to on-air insults Trump had delivered earlier in the day to CBS News-man John Dickerson.  Colbert’s slew of frat-boy remarks culminated in a crack that the only thing Trump’s mouth is good for “is being Vladimir Putin’s [expletive] holster.” The naughty word was bleeped in the broadcast, and Colbert’s mouth was pixelated. But, intrepid journalists, who are paid to ferret out the truth, discovered what was the word, and they printed it – minus the offending syllable, of course.  All hell broke loose.  Trump called Colbert “no-talent guy.” Colbert’s monologue was plastered by some as inappropriately vulgar, by others as homophobic. The FCC received thousands of complaints. Reporters breathlessly reported Colbert was under FCC investigation, and a good time was had by all.  Today, however, the FCC put an end to the fun, saying in a statement: “Consistent with standard operating procedure, the FCC’s Enforcement Bureau has reviewed the complaints and the material that was the subject of these complaints.”  “The Bureau has concluded that there was nothing actionable under the FCC’s rules.”  In rough numbers, the FCC was saying that programs airing on broadcast TV stations before 10 PM are subject to fine if the commission determines they are “indecent.” Shows that run in late-night, however, have a different threshold: content must be ruled “obscene” for stations to be fined. FCC defines obscene as content that “must appeal to an average person’s prurient interest; depict or describe sexual conduct in a ‘patently offensive’ way; and, taken as a whole, lack serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.”  Here’s the monologue that launched a thousand complaints:","Here is the sentence you provided:

The FCC has decided against taking any action on Stephen Colbert’s May 1 Late Show broadcast, in which he treated President Donald Trump to a series of increasingly Rabelaisian insults, in response to on-air insults Trump had delivered earlier in the day to CBS News-man John Dickerson.

Here is the news piece based on that sentence:

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has opted not to pursue any action against comedian and late-night host Stephen Colbert, following his May 1 broadcast in which he directed a series of colorful insults at President Donald Trump. The decision comes after Trump had earlier in the day attacked CBS News correspondent John Dickerson during a live press conference.

In the Late Show segment, Colbert took aim at Trump with a series of increasingly Rabelaisian insults, prompting widespread criticism and calls for the FCC to take action. However, the FCC has now announced that it will not be taking any further measures against Colbert or his show.

The decision is likely to be seen as a victory for free speech advocates, who have argued that comedians and other public figures should be allowed to criticize politicians and government officials without fear of retribution. It also underscores the challenges faced by regulatory agencies in navigating the complex and often contentious landscape of political satire and commentary.

The FCC's decision not to take action against Colbert comes as the agency continues to grapple with the complex and evolving landscape of media and telecommunications in the digital age. The agency has faced criticism from both sides of the political aisle in recent months, with some arguing that it has not done enough to protect consumers and promote competition, while others have accused it of overreach and abuse of power.

In a statement, an FCC spokesperson said that the agency ""takes all complaints regarding broadcast content seriously and will continue to monitor the situation and take appropriate action as necessary."" However, the spokesperson declined to provide further details on the specifics of the decision not to take action against Colbert.

The controversy surrounding Colbert's broadcast is just the latest in a series of high-profile incidents in which comedians and other public figures have been criticized for their comments about Trump and other politicians. The ongoing debate over the limits of free speech and the role of government in regulating media and telecommunications is likely to continue to be a major focus of attention in the coming months and years."

Besides that, he also talked about his mental health, fame and ongoing therapy as well.  Also read: Did Robert Pattinson breakup with FKA Twigs because of Katy Perry?  Asked if fame and mental health issues are connected, the 31-year-old English actor responded, ""Yes. Definitely. Pretty much every person I know who's got famous is completely nuts. It's just isolation and also the repetitiveness of your interactions with people... It's just weird.""  But he also explained how he maintained his own sanity. ""I had good agents and stuff and I've had really good friends since the beginning.""  ""So I think when it gets dangerous for people is when you have no friends and you think, 'Oh, if I get strangers to love me then it will fill that hole.' And then when it doesn't fill the hole, then you go 10 times crazier,'"" he said.  Adding, ""I try to not be seen whatsoever between movies. So hopefully the only thing that exists of you in the public realm is what you agree to put out there.""  Talking about his mental condition, he admitted that he was really crazy earlier.

Mary J. Blige, the renowned R&B singer, has denied any involvement in a hateful message that was tweeted about her estranged husband, Martin “Kendu” Isaacs. In a statement released to the press, Blige claimed that her Twitter account was hacked and that the offensive message was not written by her.

The message in question, which has since been deleted, read: “I can’t believe I wasted 15 years of my life on that man. He’s a loser and a deadbeat dad. #KenduIsaacsIsATotalDisaster.” Blige’s representatives have confirmed that the tweet was sent from the singer’s official Twitter account, but they maintain that she was not the one who wrote it.

Blige and Isaacs, who were married for 15 years before filing for divorce in 2016, have been embroiled in a contentious split, with both sides accusing the other of various forms of wrongdoing. The hateful message, which was posted on Wednesday evening, only serves to further escalate the tension between the two.

Despite Blige’s denials, many of her fans have expressed outrage over the message, with some calling for her to be held accountable for her words. However, others have come to her defense, pointing out that the tweet could have been the work of a disgruntled fan or a hacker looking to stir up trouble.

Regardless of who was responsible for the message, it is clear that the situation between Blige and Isaacs is becoming increasingly toxic. As the divorce proceedings continue to drag on, it remains to be seen how much more drama will be revealed."

LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) — Blake Griffin’s injury-plagued career will now take him to Detroit after being traded to the Pistons on Monday, and the question of a career decline and a link to a certain celebrity family has surfaced.

Here is your news story:

In a shocking move that has sent shockwaves throughout the NBA, Blake Griffin has been traded to the Detroit Pistons on Monday, ending his tumultuous tenure with the Los Angeles Clippers. The trade comes as a surprise to many, given Griffin's injury-plagued career and the rumors of a decline in his performance.

But the most intriguing aspect of this trade is the connection to a certain celebrity family. Sources close to the situation have revealed that Griffin's relationship with the Kardashian family may have played a role in his trade to Detroit.

Griffin, who has been dating Kendall Jenner for several years, has been linked to the Kardashian family through his high-profile relationship. And some insiders believe that this connection may have influenced the Pistons' decision to acquire Griffin.

""The Kardashian factor can't be ignored,"" said one NBA insider. ""The Pistons may have seen an opportunity to bring in a talented player who also brings a certain level of celebrity appeal to the team.""

Griffin, who has struggled with injuries throughout his career, will be looking to prove himself in Detroit. The 30-year-old forward has averaged 22.6 points and 8.1 rebounds per game over his nine-year career, but has only played in 18 games this season due to a knee injury.

The trade is a significant one for both the Clippers and the Pistons, and it will be interesting to see how Griffin performs in his new surroundings. But one thing is certain: the Kardashian connection has added an extra layer of intrigue to this trade."

And it wasn't just rough for Jen at the end of their relationship, either — apparently, they were doomed from the get-go. The source explained that Jen said, ""It was never a real marriage to start with."" It was a classic case of opposites attracting — she liked game nights in with her celebrity pals whereas he would rather hit the town — and the source revealed that it was soon after they started initially dating that things took a turn for the worse. ""It didn't take long for their different personalities and relationship expectations to clash. They'd fight for weeks at a time!"" (Photo Credit: Getty Images ) And when the fighting persisted, Jen would seek out her friends for comfort.","Soon after Justin Theroux and Jennifer Aniston announced their split, fans were determined to figure out what went wrong. Now, one month later, Life & Style has exclusively learned that he ""put her through hell.""

According to a source close to the couple, Theroux's behavior during their four-year relationship was ""controlling and emotionally abusive.""

""Justin was very possessive and jealous of Jen's success and freedom,"" the source reveals. ""He would constantly question her about her whereabouts, who she was with, and what she was doing.""

Theroux's alleged behavior took a toll on Aniston, who felt ""trapped"" in the relationship, the source says.

""Jen tried to brush it off at first, thinking that Justin would eventually change his ways,"" the source continues. ""But as time went on, things only got worse. She felt like she was walking on eggshells all the time, never knowing when he would blow up at her.""

The final straw, the source says, was when Theroux accused Aniston of being ""too close"" to her ex-husband Brad Pitt, who she was married to before she met Theroux.

""Justin was convinced that Brad was still in love with Jen and that she was leading him on,"" the source reveals. ""He became even more possessive and controlling after that, and Jen couldn't take it anymore.""

The source adds that Aniston's friends and family were ""extremely worried"" about her during the relationship and that they ""tried to intervene several times.""

Aniston, who has remained silent since the split, is said to be ""happy and relieved"" to be out of the relationship.

Theroux, on the other hand, has been ""holed up"" in his apartment, ""refusing to talk to anyone,"" the source says.

""He's in a state of denial and is trying to figure out what went wrong,"" the source adds. ""But the truth is, he was the one who destroyed the relationship with his controlling and abusive behavior."""

Joe Jonas looks like he’s having a blast on the beach! The 28-year-old was spotted surrounded by a group of bikini-clad women on Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia on Feb. 22 — but none of which were Sophie Turner. Don’t worry, though! The girls were just fans of the DNCE frontman, who graciously posed for photos with them on the sunny shoreline. How sweet!  The “Cake By The Ocean” singer went Down Under to shoot the upcoming season of The Voice Australia, which he will be a celebrity coach on, alongside Delta Goodrem, Kelly Rowland, and Boy George. While his fiancée didn’t make the trip, the couple were able to spend some quality time together before Joe’s excursion to the Southern Hemisphere. Earlier this month, the pair enjoyed a romantic getaway to a private island in the Maldives, and then followed up the vacation with a huge celebration in New York City for Sophie’s 22nd birthday on Feb. 21. Joe’s brother Nick Jonas even commemorated the occasion by giving a sweet shout-out to the birthday girl. He shared a photo from Sophie and Joe’s engagement party in Nov. 2017, and captioned the pic that also included Kevin and Frankie Jonas, “Happy Birthday @sophiet You’re super cool! We all think so!” Aww, it’s like she’s already part of the family!  You can also bet that the Game Of Thrones star wouldn’t mind her fiancé posing for photos with a bunch of beauties on the beach. On her birthday, Sophie posted a video to her Instagram story jamming out to “22” by Taylor Swift (as any self-respecting 22-year-old would do on their birthday). As you may remember, Tay and Joe used to be a ~thing~ back in 2008. But clearly, that doesn’t phase the X-Men: Apocalypse star in the slightest — nor should it. Taylor has her own Joe (Alwyn) now, and the Josie star has made it clear there’s no bad blood between them. She even came to the singer’s defense when people on Twitter questioned her inclusion in TIME‘s Person of the Year issue in December. Basically Sophie is the best, and we’re sure Joe knows that!  HollywoodLifers, are you sad that Sophie isn’t in Australia with Joe?","---

Joe Jonas, the heartthrob of millions, has been spotted soaking up the sun in Australia with a group of beautiful women. However, the most surprising part of this story is that none of them were his wife, Sophie Turner.

According to sources, Joe was seen lounging on the beach with a group of gorgeous women, laughing and having a great time. The group included several models and actresses, who were all dressed in swimsuits and enjoying the sunny weather.

While Joe and Sophie have been married for over a year now, it appears that he is not letting his marriage hold him back from having a little fun with his friends. The group was seen enjoying water sports, playing beach volleyball, and even having a picnic on the beach.

Joe and Sophie have been open about their relationship and have always been supportive of each other's careers and personal choices. However, this recent outing has raised some eyebrows, especially since Sophie was not present.

A source close to the couple has revealed that Sophie is completely fine with Joe's outing and has even encouraged him to have some time off with his friends. The source also added that Sophie is currently busy with her own work commitments and could not join Joe on this trip.

Despite the speculation, it is clear that Joe and Sophie's relationship is still going strong. The couple has been spotted together on several occasions, and they always look happy and in love.

In conclusion, Joe Jonas's recent outing in Australia with a group of beautiful women may have raised some eyebrows, but it is clear that his relationship with Sophie Turner is still going strong. The couple is supportive of each other's personal choices and is happy to spend time apart when necessary."

After playing 150 concerts across 40 countries during the world tour, Bieber cancelled the final 14, saying he was “just resting, getting some relaxation”. In a message on Instagram, he has elaborated on his reasons.  “I’ve learned the more you appreciate your calling the more you want to protect your calling,” he wrote. “Me taking this time right now is me saying I want to be SUSTAINABLE... so that I can be the man I want to be, the husband I eventually want to be, and the father I want to be.”  Perhaps referring to the string of fractious incidents he has been involved with, including punching a Spanish fan, driving drunk in a Lamborghini and being banned from China, he added: “Learning and growing hasn’t always been easy but knowing I’m not alone has kept me going. I have let my insecurities get the best of me at times, I let my broken relationships dictate the way I acted toward people and the way I treated them.

Guardian Service","Justin Bieber has explained to fans why he cancelled the remainder of his Purpose world tour, saying “I want my mind heart and soul to be sustainable”.

Global pop sensation Justin Bieber has made the surprising decision to cancel the rest of his Purpose world tour, citing the need to prioritize his mental, emotional, and spiritual well-being. In a heartfelt message to his devoted fans, Bieber revealed that he wants his ""mind, heart, and soul to be sustainable"" and that he needs to take a break from the rigorous demands of touring to achieve this goal.

This announcement has come as a shock to fans who had been eagerly anticipating the remaining dates of the tour, which were set to take place in North America, Europe, and Asia. However, Bieber's decision to prioritize his own well-being is a testament to his commitment to his craft and his desire to maintain a healthy and balanced lifestyle.

According to sources close to the singer, the decision to cancel the tour was not an easy one, and Bieber spent many sleepless nights weighing the pros and cons of continuing the tour versus taking a break. However, in the end, he determined that his mental and emotional health were more important than any professional obligations.

Fans have been supportive of Bieber's decision, with many taking to social media to express their understanding and admiration for the singer's commitment to his well-being. Some have even praised him for setting a positive example for young people everywhere by prioritizing mental health and self-care.

While the cancellation of the Purpose world tour is certainly a disappointment for fans, Bieber's decision to prioritize his own well-being is a reminder that our mental and emotional health should always come first.

Five figures is a huge expense for a one-day affair. That is, unless you're ultra-rich — and especially if you're royalty rich.  Next month, the world will bear witness to the most anticipated royal wedding in years. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are set to be married on May 19 at St. George's Chapel, in Windsor, and will begin a carriage procession immediately after the ceremony. Their reception will take place later on the grounds of Windsor Castle.  Kensington Palace will cover the cost of the wedding, an expense traditionally taken on by the bride's family.  The case was the same for Kate Middleton and Prince William's 2011 royal wedding— the only item Middleton paid for was her six-figure Alexander McQueen dress. Their total wedding celebration cost $34 million (£23.7 million).  Markle and Prince Harry's wedding will reportedly cost in excess of $45.8 million (£32 million), according to Bride Book's estimation. That's over 1,000 more than the average wedding.  The venue is the biggest part of a typical wedding budget for couples in the US and the UK, taking up nearly half of the entire wedding cost. Access to St. George's Chapel — and St. George's Great Hall, where the wedding reception will take place — is free of charge for Markle and Prince Harry. Transportation is also free, thanks to the Queen's fleet of Rolls-Royces, Daimlers, and Bentleys.  The greatest cost for the royal couple? Security. Protecting Markle and Prince Harry, plus thousands of guests and onlookers, will run Kensington Palace a whopping $43 million (£30 million), estimates Bride Book. That includes the cost of snipers, undercover police, military technology, and security drones. The bulk of Kate Middleton and Prince William's wedding budget similarly went to security costs.  Otherwise, Markle and Prince Harry's total wedding spend, including food, cakes, entertainment, wardrobe, and the honeymoon, amounts to about $2.8 million.  Below, check out Bride Book's breakdown of what the royal wedding will cost.","The cost of a royal wedding is incomparably higher. The bill for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's 2018 wedding was estimated to be around $45 million (£30 million). The wedding will be a multi-day affair, with many events and receptions.

Title: Royal Wedding a Multi-Million Dollar Affair

The upcoming royal wedding between Prince Harry and Meghan Markle is expected to be a lavish and extravagant affair, with the estimated cost of the event reaching into the tens of millions of dollars. According to recent reports, the total cost of the wedding is estimated to be around $45 million (£30 million), making it one of the most expensive weddings in recent history.

The high cost of the wedding can be attributed to the many events and receptions that will take place over the course of several days. The wedding will begin with a traditional church service, followed by a reception at St. George's Hall in Windsor Castle. The reception will be held in the State Dining Room, which can accommodate up to 160 guests. The evening will continue with a private dinner and dancing at a nearby estate.

The cost of the wedding is not only due to the number of events, but also the high profile of the guests and the level of security and protocol that must be observed. The wedding will be attended by numerous members of the royal family, as well as celebrities and dignitaries from around the world. The security costs alone are estimated to be around $30 million (£20 million).

While the cost of the wedding may be high, it is a small price to pay for the joy and celebration that the union of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will bring to the nation. The wedding is a symbol of the enduring love and commitment of the couple, and will be remembered for generations to come.

In conclusion, the upcoming royal wedding is shaping up to be a multi-million dollar affair, with the estimated cost of the event reaching into the tens of millions of dollars. The high cost is due to the many events and receptions, as well as the high profile of the guests and the level of security and protocol that must be observed. However, the wedding is a joyous occasion that will be remembered for generations to come."

Gomez’s rekindled friendship with Justin Bieber, however, had nothing to do with the rapper’s decision to end his romance with the singer.  As Gossip Cop reported, Gomez and The Weeknd recently split after nearly a year of dating. The pair weren’t seen together much during the summer, though it was later revealed the singer-actress was laying low due to a kidney transplant. Regardless, they still appeared to be going strong in the early fall. Prior to the announcement of their breakup, the status of their relationship was questioned after it emerged Gomez had rekindled her friendship with Bieber. © Gossip Cop (Getty Images)  On Sunday, that speculation swirled as Bieber and Gomez were seen in public and The Weeknd stopped following her friends on social media. That being said, Bieber was allegedly not responsible for the breakup. Rather, it was the challenges of a long-distance relationship, particularly with The Weeknd touring and Gomez’s shooting schedule, that led both the former couple to reconsider their fizzling relationship.  Additionally, contributing to their split, the rapper felt “tied down” in a relationship that had lost its spark. Over time, the pair started talking less frequently on the phone, prompting The Weeknd to end his romance with Gomez, reports TMZ. Despite their breakup, we’re told that the pair are still on good terms and have talked several times since the split.  Predictably, after the rapper ended his relationship with Gomez, Gossip Cop busted the often disproven HollywoodLife for claiming in a made-up report that The Weeknd was “heartbroken” over Gomez reconnecting with Bieber. In the bogus story, the bad blog ridiculously asserted that The Weeknd and Gomez were caught in a “love triangle” with Bieber, but of course, the breakup had nothing to do with and wasn’t caused by the “Love Yourself” singer.

In a shocking turn of events, The Weeknd has reportedly instigated his breakup with Selena Gomez, multiple sources have confirmed to Gossip Cop. According to insiders, the rapper's decision to end his romance with the singer had nothing to do with her rekindled friendship with Justin Bieber, as some may have suspected.

The news of the couple's split has sent shockwaves through the entertainment industry, as The Weeknd and Gomez had been one of the most high-profile celebrity couples in recent years. The two had been dating since 2017 and had been open about their relationship on social media, with The Weeknd even featuring Gomez in his music video for ""Heartless.""

Sources close to the couple have revealed that The Weeknd's decision to end the relationship was not an easy one, and that he had been struggling with the idea of breaking up with Gomez for some time. However, ultimately, he decided that it was best for him to move on and focus on his own personal growth and career.

Gomez, on the other hand, has been focusing on her own personal and professional life, and has been spending more time with her friends and family. While she is said to be heartbroken over the breakup, she is reportedly doing well and is looking forward to moving on and exploring new opportunities.

The news of The Weeknd and Gomez's split has left fans devastated, but many are also praising the couple for their maturity and willingness to move on from the relationship in a healthy and respectful way.

In a statement to Gossip Cop, a source close to The Weeknd said, ""He and Selena had a great run, but ultimately, they decided that it was time to move on. They are both very focused on their own careers and personal growth right now, and they wish each other the best.""

The statement from Gomez's camp was equally as positive, with a source saying, ""Selena is doing well and is grateful for the time she spent with The Weeknd. She is looking forward to exploring new opportunities and focusing on her own personal and professional growth.""

Pitt is an honorary member of the Epidermolysis Bullosa Medical Research Foundation (EBMRF) that is dedicated to raising money and awareness for the rare skin disorder, epidermolysis bullosa.In January, Pitt introduced singer Chris Cornell during a Rock4EB annual charity to support EBMRF.Further, he revealed in a 2013 Esquire Magazine interview that he self-diagnosed himself with a rare disease – prosopagnosia — also known as face blindness. According to the article, ""Brad Pitt won't remember you. If you've met him, he'll have no idea who you are when he meets you again. Even if you've had what he calls ""a real conversation,"" your face will start fading from his memory as soon as you walk away.""It should be noted that being diagnosed with a condition and being self-diagnosed with a condition can be 2 very different diagnoses.Prosopagnosia refers to the inability to recognize familiar people from their face. They may also be unable to recognize other stimuli, such as objects, cars, or animals.People with prosopagnosia typically learn to use non-face cues including voice, walking style and hairstyle to recognize others. The underlying genetic cause of developmental prosopagnosia is not known but familial reports of this condition are consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance.Epidermolysis bullosa (aka 'the worst disease you've never heard of') is a group of devastating, life-threatening genetic skin disorders impacting children that is characterized by skin blisters and erosions all over the body.The most severe form, recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, is characterized by chronic skin blistering, open and painful wounds, joint contractures, esophageal strictures, pseudosyndactyly, corneal abrasions and a shortened life span. Patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa lack functional type VII collagen (C7) owing to mutations in the gene COL7A1 that encodes for C7 and is the main component of anchoring fibrils that attach the dermis to the epidermis.Epidermolysis bullosa patients suffer through intense pain throughout their lives, with no effective treatments available to reduce the severity of their symptoms.",".

Title: Rare Disease Research: Unveiling the Mystery of Prosopagnosia and Epidermolysis Bullosa

Date: May 2, 2017

As the world observes Rare Disease Day today, we shine the spotlight on two lesser-known conditions that have left scientists and medical professionals baffled for years. Prosopagnosia, also known as face blindness, and epidermolysis bullosa, a skin condition characterized by extreme fragility, have been the subject of ongoing research in the rare disease community.

Prosopagnosia, a condition that affects the ability to recognize faces, has long been a topic of interest among researchers. Despite its prevalence, the underlying causes of the disorder remain largely unknown. According to a recent study published in the journal Neuron, researchers have identified a specific genetic mutation that may be responsible for the condition. The study, conducted by a team of scientists from the University of California, Los Angeles, found that individuals with prosopagnosia are more likely to have a mutation in the gene encoding the protein Plexin-A2. This protein plays a crucial role in face perception and recognition.

Meanwhile, epidermolysis bullosa, a group of genetic skin disorders, has been the focus of another recent study. This condition is characterized by the formation of blisters and sores on the skin, mucous membranes, and organs. The study, published in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology, revealed that individuals with epidermolysis bullosa have a deficiency in the enzyme keratin 5, which is essential for the maintenance of skin integrity. Researchers believe that this deficiency may lead to the development of the condition.

While these findings are promising, much work remains to be done. The researchers involved in these studies emphasize the need for further investigation to better understand the causes of these conditions and to develop effective treatments.

""These discoveries bring us one step closer to unlocking the mysteries of prosopagnosia and epidermolysis bullosa,"" said Dr. Jane Smith, lead author of the study on prosopagnosia. ""We hope that our findings will pave the way for the development of targeted therapies and improve the quality of life for individuals affected by these conditions.""

In conclusion, Rare Disease Day serves as a reminder of the importance of ongoing research into the mysteries of rare diseases like prosopagnosia and epidermolysis bullosa. With continued support and funding, scientists and medical professionals can work towards finding effective treatments and improving the lives of those affected by these conditions.

USA TODAY President Trump in Trump Tower. (Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP) Corrections & Clarifications: A previous version of the story included a tweet from a parody account claiming to Jill Biden. NEW YORK CITY – President Trump's argument Tuesday that left wing groups were just as violent as the white supremacists who staged a demonstration in Charlottesville set off a firestorm of criticism from members of his own party – and raised questions about his personal views of racial tensions in the country. Just one day after Trump sought to tamp down on controversy by condemning white supremacists for their role in racially motivated clashes in the Virginia city, the president appeared to return to his highly criticized initial response that many sides were to blame for the weekend violence. ""What about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, alt-right?"" Trump told reporters in a chaotic impromptu press conference at Trump Tower. ""Do they have any semblance of guilt? What about the fact they came charging with clubs in their hands?"" Trump said he couldn't make a condemnation of hate groups earlier because he didn't ""know all the facts"" about an alleged white nationalist who crashed a car into a crowd of protesters, killing one person and wounded 19 others. CLOSE From Trump Tower in New York City, President Trump told reporters that both sides were to blame for the violence that occurred in Charlottesville, Virginia. USA TODAY ""I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct,"" Trump said from Trump Tower in New York, after an event that was intended to be devoted to a new infrastructure executive order. Trump has been especially quick to denounce previous terrorist attacks, including those taking place overseas. Yet he was notably reticent to pinpoint the blame for one on Saturday that involved white supremacists – a point his critics on both sides of the aisle continued to hammer. ""We must be clear. White supremacy is repulsive. This bigotry is counter to all this country stands for. There can be no moral ambiguity,” said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. added: ""There is only one side to be on when a white supremacist mob brutalizes and murders in America.” Several lawmakers were dismayed the president appeared to equate white supremacists with their opponents. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., tweeted: ""Blaming 'both sides' for #Charlottesville?! No. Back to relativism when dealing with KKK, Nazi sympathizers, white supremacists? Just no."" Another Republican, Rep. Charlie Dent from Pennsylvania, said Trump ""must stop the moral equivalency! AGAIN."" Over the weekend, Trump faced heavy criticism from both Republicans and Democrats for chiding ""many sides"" for their role in the violence in Charlottesville on Saturday, a statement many regarded as tepid toward racists. A full two days later, on Monday, Trump at the White House directly condemned the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists and announced the Justice Department would open up a civil rights investigation into the driver of the car that killed Charlottesville resident Heather Heyer. Yet on Tuesday, amid questions about whether Trump meant the words behind his most recent scripted statement, the president called his initial response ""fine"" and blamed the press for being dishonest in its coverage. ""There was no way of making a correct statement that early,"" he said at one point. ""I had to see the facts. Unlike a lot of reporters – I didn't know (prominent white supremacist) David Duke was there. I wanted to see the facts."" For his part, former KKK leader Duke tweeted a thank you to the president after his statement Tuesday – for condemning ""the leftist terrorists"" in Black Lives Matter and Antifa.","No problem! Here's the news piece based on your sentence:

In a surprise statement issued from Trump Tower in New York City, President Trump has asserted that both protesters and counter protesters are equally to blame for the violence that erupted in Charlottesville, Virginia over the weekend. Speaking to reporters, the President expressed his belief that the clashes were not the result of a single group or ideology, but rather the culmination of a complex web of factors and motivations.

""We have to look at all sides,"" President Trump said, when asked to comment on the violence that left one person dead and numerous others injured. ""I think there's blame on both sides. You had a group on one side that was protesting very quietly, and you had a group on the other side that was protesting very loudly. And then you had a group in the middle that was trying to do what's right, but they were being confronted by both sides.""

The President's statement was met with swift criticism from both sides of the political aisle, with many lawmakers and activists condemning his failure to explicitly denounce white supremacists and other extremist groups that were involved in the violence. Despite this, the President remained steadfast in his position, insisting that all parties involved must take responsibility for their actions.

The situation in Charlottesville is ongoing, with local authorities continuing to investigate the violence and make arrests. The President's statement has only added fuel to an already contentious and emotional debate, with many Americans expressing outrage and dismay at his words. As the situation continues to unfold, one thing is clear: the fallout from Charlottesville will be felt for a long time to come."

gossipcop-3308884181,1,0,"Beyoncé Rumored To Be Asking For Silent Delivery  As the countdown to Blueprint 1 and Blueprint 2’s arrival continues, the stories about Bey’s birth plans abound. First, we heard she planned to give birth at home, then they said her security has been running weekly drills to practice their approach to Cedars-Sinai and now there’s a report that Bey wants silence in the delivery room.  According to Naughty Gossip reports:  “Beyoncé likes peace and calm around her. She has zero time for drama and gossip. She likes her inner circle to be soft spoken if they have to talk at all. And you can expect the same will be true when she gives birth to the twins,” sources tell Straight Shuter. “You can only get into her private life if you are invited. She is very guarded and protects her privacy at all cost. She likes to be surrounded with peaceful colors and soft sounds. This will be of utmost importance for her when giving birth.”  This story is almost like opening up a fortune cookie or visiting your average storefront psychic. EVERYBODY knows Beyoncé is private. THAT doesn’t take an exclusive source to figure out.  Silent birth is a real thing though – something that Scientologists practice and Katie Holmes even did when she gave birth to Suri, but as much as Bey loves music we don’t really see her doing a silent birth.  Speaking of Bey’s love of music… Hit the flip for some recently posted pics of her from a Michael Jackson/Prince party.  GettyImages/Instagram","The latest gossip is that Queen Bey is asking for a silent delivery. Yes, you heard that right, Beyoncé wants a delivery without any noise!

According to a close source, Beyoncé is not only planning a silent delivery, but she also wants her hospital room to be soundproofed so that no one can hear her babies cry.

Beyoncé, who has always been a private person, is determined to keep her birth experience under wraps. She has reportedly instructed her staff to only allow a select few to be present during the delivery, and she has also requested that the hospital staff to be silent during the entire process.

While this may seem like an extreme request, it's not entirely surprising given Beyoncé's history of keeping her personal life private. After all, this is the same woman who refused to confirm her pregnancy until she was well into her second trimester.

The question is, will Beyoncé be able to pull off a silent delivery? Only time will tell, but one thing is for sure: Beyoncé is determined to keep her birth experience under wraps."

The photo shoot promises to be Caitlyn's finest hour since she first announced her transition in an interview with ABC’s Diane Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July.  Although the Kardashian-Jenner clan is said to be ‘wholly supportive’ of Jenner’s transition, sources close to the family say the prospect of a nude shoot is ‘their worst nightmare’.

The photo shoot promises to be Caitlyn's finest hour since she first announced her transition in an interview with ABC’s Diane Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July  Although the Kardashian-Jenner clan is said to be ‘wholly supportive’ of Jenner’s transition, sources close to the family say the prospect of a nude shoot is ‘their worst nightmare’  An insider tells DailyMail.com that the Kardashians learned of the 67-year-old’s plan from her model son Brody, 33.  ‘Brody told them that Caitlyn has planned and booked a full nude photo shoot and they were like, that’s unacceptable, it’s taking things too far,' the source said.  ‘They’re hoping the shoot doesn't come to pass because that would be their worst nightmare. Taking it to that level and unveiling her [new body] with a fully naked photo spread is going way too far.'  Kardashian momager Kris, who is said to have known about Jenner’s surgery in advance, has vowed to stop the shoot from going ahead, according to the insider.  ‘She knew the surgery was inevitable and it was bound to happen,’ said the source. ‘But she says she will do everything in her power to stop the shoot if she can.'  DailyMail.com has approached representatives for Jenner and the Kardashians for comment. Jenner's rep knew nothing about it.  Jenner first announced her transition in an interview with Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July.  The headline-making ‘I am Cait’ shoot was said to have taken the Kardashian clan by surprise at the time and led to tension between Jenner and Kim, 36, as a result.  Nevertheless, the family have been publicly supportive of her decision to transition, which was completed in January according leaked extracts from her memoir.  Jenner wrote of the $20,000 operation: 'The surgery was a success, and I feel not only wonderful but liberated […] I am going to live authentically for the first time in my life.  ‘I am going to have an enthusiasm for life that I have not had in 39 years since the Olympics, almost two thirds of my life.'  But the book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife and step-children.  Sources close to the family told DailyMail.com that Jenner’s ‘unpredictable’ behavior has also played a part in their current estrangement.  The insider said: ‘[The book] is definitely something that she’s wanted to do for a while and it was just a matter of time before she got it done.  ‘But the family were like, it’s probably going to reopen the drama of everything [that has happened].  ‘They were worried because she’s been so unpredictable lately and just trying to get out into the limelight.’  Jenner's book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife  A second leaked extract from the memoir has already proven embarrassing, after Jenner claimed the late Robert Kardashian knew O.J.

It is being reported by DailyMail.com that Caitlyn Jenner, 67, is planning to take it all off for a nude photo shoot. The decision comes just months after the reality TV star underwent gender reassignment surgery in January, as revealed in her new memoir, 'The Secrets of My Life.'

According to sources close to the former Olympic athlete, Jenner is looking to embrace her new identity by baring all for the upcoming photo shoot. This will be the first time that Jenner will have posed nude in public, and it is expected to generate significant attention and controversy.

Jenner's decision to go nude comes as no surprise, given her history of pushing boundaries and challenging societal norms. In her memoir, she opens up about her struggles with gender identity and her decision to transition from male to female.

The upcoming photo shoot is expected to be a powerful statement of self-acceptance and confidence, and it will undoubtedly spark a national conversation about gender, identity, and the human body.

While some may criticize Jenner's decision as being too provocative or attention-seeking, it is important to remember that her journey is one of self-discovery and empowerment. By embracing her true identity, Jenner is inspiring countless others to do the same.

The photo shoot is expected to take place in the coming weeks, and DailyMail.com will be there to capture every moment. Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story."

The former Real Housewife of New York, ran around the grounds in an A-line Carolina Herrera dress, posing on the step-and-repeat, taking photos with fans, and catching up with old friends. Trying to track her down for an interview turned into a scavenger hunt.  Scattered around the lawn were tables for vendors selling everything from wine to sex toys. There was a station for guests to get a vitamin infusion, with seats in the direct line of the sun transforming the spot into an inescapable sauna-I.V. drip hybrid. Housewives from across the country flew into town for the occasion (Vicki Gunvalson of Orange County and LeeAnne Locken of Dallas), which also served as a benefit for Thyroid Cancer Research in honor of Zarin’s late husband, Bobby, who died of the disease in January.  Upon first try to flag Zarin down for a couple of questions, she sent over her daughter, Ally Shapiro, in her stead. Shapiro reflected on last year’s luncheon, when her stepfather was still struggling with cancer, but encouraged her and her mother to party on.  “He loved drinking and partying. This was the highlight of his year,” she said. “It was this time last year that we were told he wasn’t gonna make it another week, and he pushed us and he said, ‘Go to the party. Maybe I won’t be here when you come back, but go.’”  Shapiro, who now lives in London while she works on her master’s degree, admits that she can’t watch old episodes of Real Housewives, which showed her as 14-year-old struggling to get close to her stepfather. “You want to think that it’s like a home movie, but it’s not. That’s not what our relationship was like,” she said, adding that the reruns play constantly in the U.K. “I’m walking down the street and someone’s like, ‘Oh my God, I just saw you trying on a prom dress!’”  She also said that her mother is dabbling with dating, specifically with a man she plays tennis with. “It’s fun, and I live in London so it’s good for her to have a distraction.”  Dina Lohan, dressed in a metallic green blazer and shorts set and a pair of oversized aviators, arrived fashionably late to the affair, but was immediately greeted by hoards of people trying to chat her up or get a photo. Eventually secured in the same spot for more than a few seconds, she was willing to talk about her daughter Lindsay’s upcoming project for MTV, a Vanderpump Rules–inspired reality show that follows Lindsay and the employees of her new Lohan Beach Club. Bunim/Murray Productions is producing the series, the same company that produced Lohan’s E! reality show Living Lohan a decade ago.  “These kids were like, babies, and now they’re running the show,” she said of the crew. “They lived in my house! And now they’re all corporate. . . . We’re home. It’s cyclical, you know.”  Lohan also revealed that the upcoming series is a bit of a family affair with Lindsay’s younger sister, 24-year-old Ali, providing the theme song.  A friend of Lohan’s interjected, asking if Ali, like her older sister over a decade ago, had moved out to L.A. for work.  “She’s in New York with me,” the matriarch answered. “I keep them close! I’m not going to lose someone to L.A., no. Not again!”  Finally, the woman of the hour managed to stop and take a breath. While Zarin may no longer be a Bravo housewife, she still knows how to schmooze like one. She’s been keeping up with the latest season of the show here and there, and even received a good-luck message from Luann de Lesseps, who checked into rehab earlier in the month, wishing her good luck on the event. Having brought me up to speed, Zarin closed our conversation with a plug for her new line of “pet-proof, gorgeous, and inexpensive” rugs, aptly titled Jill Zarin Rugs.

It was a scorching hot summer day in Bridgehampton on Saturday, but that didn’t deter a sea of fashionistas and socialites from flocking to Topping Rose House for Jill Zarin’s highly anticipated annual luncheon. Despite the sweltering heat, the crowd of stylish guests, clad in their finest summer attire, eagerly gathered under the shaded tent on the picturesque grounds of the historic estate.

The event, which has become a staple on the Hamptons social calendar, did not disappoint, with attendees enjoying a delectable menu of refreshing salads, succulent entrees, and decadent desserts, all expertly paired with exquisite wines and champagnes. As they sipped and savored, the guests were treated to a series of engaging speeches and toasts, including a heartfelt tribute to Jill Zarin’s late husband, Bobby, who passed away earlier this year.

The atmosphere was one of joy and celebration, with friends and family coming together to honor Jill’s enduring legacy and her tireless efforts to support local charities and community organizations. As the afternoon wore on and the sun began to set, the guests reluctantly bid their farewells and made their way home, already looking forward to next year’s luncheon.

All in all, Jill Zarin’s annual luncheon at Topping Rose House was a resounding success, with its blend of elegance, camaraderie, and philanthropy making it a truly unforgettable experience for all who attended."

The 20-year-old cosmetics guru — who is expecting her first child, a baby girl, with boyfriend Travis Scott — did not appear in any photos from the bash shared to social media by KarJenner family members. But a source tells PEOPLE she was there celebrating away from the cameras.  “Kylie looked great but didn’t really draw any attention to her baby bump,” the source says. “She still acts like she wants to keep her pregnancy private.”  Meanwhile, her sister Khloé Kardashian, — who earlier this week confirmed that she and boyfriend Tristan Thompson are expecting their first child together — accentuated her own baby bump in a skin-tight, sparkly jumpsuit with a white fur coat.  “Khloé was beaming all night,” the insider says of the 33-year-old Revenge Body host. “She kept touching and showing off her cute baby belly.”  Khloé showed off her bump on Instagram as well.  “Merry Christmas!! May you sparkle and shine this festive season, may all of your wishes and dreams come true,” Khloé captioned a gallery of shots showing her touching her belly. “I pray that we all may feel this happiness all year round.

He kept bringing her drinks and doting on her. Younes fits right into the family. He didn’t seem uncomfortable that Scott was there. They said hello, but that was it. It was very civil.”  Other guests included Kim’s husband Kanye West, celebrity hair stylists Jen Atkin and Chris Appleton, singer Christina Aguilera and Keeping Up with the Kardashians executive producer Ryan Seacrest.

Kylie Jenner, the youngest member of the Kardashian-Jenner clan, may have missed out on the family's annual Christmas card photo shoot this year, but she did make an appearance at her mother Kris Jenner's annual Christmas Eve party in Los Angeles. Sources close to the family revealed that Kylie, who has been busy with her successful cosmetics line and her newborn daughter Stormi, was not present for the group photo shoot, which has been a tradition for the family for several years.

However, Kylie did make sure to spend some quality time with her loved ones on Christmas Eve, attending Kris's party at her Los Angeles home. The party was reportedly a star-studded affair, with several A-list celebrities in attendance, including Kris's boyfriend Corey Gamble and Kylie's boyfriend Travis Scott.

Despite missing out on the Christmas card, Kylie's absence was not met with any negative reactions from her family members, who are said to be supportive of her busy schedule and her focus on her business ventures. In fact, sources close to the family revealed that Kylie has been spending more time with her loved ones in recent weeks, and is said to be enjoying her time as a new mother.

gossipcop-5865271192,1,0,"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired. T","Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.

It appears that Katie Holmes is going through a tumultuous time in her personal life, with a series of reports suggesting that she is struggling to balance her relationships with her famous ex-husband Tom Cruise and her current boyfriend Jamie Foxx. According to sources close to the situation, the actress is finding it difficult to navigate the complex web of relationships, with her daughter Suri caught in the middle.

The rumors of Holmes' relationship with Foxx have been circulating for months, with some sources suggesting that the two have been secretly dating for over a year. However, Cruise, who has been fiercely protective of his daughter and his ex-wife, has reportedly been trying to sabotage the relationship, allegedly going so far as to hire private investigators to gather information on Foxx.

The situation has become so tense that Holmes has allegedly been forced to hire her own team of security to protect herself and her daughter from Cruise's attempts to interfere in her life. According to sources, the actress is determined to protect her family and is willing to do whatever it takes to ensure their safety.

The drama has also allegedly taken a toll on Suri, who is said to be confused and upset by the situation. According to sources, the young girl has been caught in the middle of her parents' bitter custody battle, with both Cruise and Holmes fighting for control over her upbringing.

As the situation continues to unfold, it is clear that Katie Holmes is facing a difficult and emotional time. The actress, who has always been private about her personal life, is now at the center of a very public and messy divorce and custody battle. Only time will tell how this situation will play out, but for now, it seems that Holmes and her loved ones are facing a very uncertain future."

It’s clear that when it comes to who she dates, Selena apparently is all about maintaining her privacy.  According to our source, it’s only a matter of time before Selena responds to Charlie’s bombshell admission that they were briefly an item — and that Justin Bieber, 23, may have caused the two to go their separate ways. “Now, she will definitely have to respond down the line, and it’s just frustrating when people add their dirty laundry to a situation,” our source added. “She’s learned from the first time dating Justin and The Weeknd that less is more, which explains her relationship with Justin now being much more under the radar.” We reported earlier how Selena and Justin put to rest rumors that they had split by reuniting at one of his hockey games.

In a shocking turn of events, Selena Gomez has reportedly expressed her disappointment over Charlie Puth's recent revelation about his dating history. According to a source close to the pop star, Gomez believes that Puth's decision to discuss his past relationships was a mistake.

The insider revealed to HollywoodLife.com that Gomez feels that Puth's disclosure was an attempt to gain attention and publicity, and that it has caused unnecessary tension in their friendship. ""Selena feels like Charlie's comments were a cheap shot at her and their friendship,"" the source explained. ""She believes that he should have kept his personal life private and not used their relationship to get attention.""

Gomez and Puth have been close friends for several years, and their friendship has been the subject of much speculation in the media. However, Gomez has always maintained that their relationship is platonic and that she values their friendship above all else.

Despite Gomez's reported disappointment, it's unlikely that their friendship will be affected by Puth's comments. ""Selena is a strong and independent woman, and she won't let Charlie's words get to her,"" the source said. ""She will continue to prioritize her own well-being and her friendship with Charlie, regardless of what he says or does.""

In the end, it seems that Gomez's reaction to Puth's disclosure is a testament to the strength and resilience of their friendship. Despite any perceived mistakes or misunderstandings, Gomez and Puth remain close and supportive of one another."

Do you think Taylor should get back together with Jake? Tell us in the comments.","Here is the news piece based on the sentence provided:

Reports have surfaced that Taylor Swift, the renowned pop sensation, is attempting to rekindle her romance with her former beau, Jake Gyllenhaal. According to sources close to the singer, Swift has been in contact with Gyllenhaal ever since he arrived in New York City to star in the Broadway production of Sunday in the Park With George.

The news comes as a surprise to many, as Swift and Gyllenhaal's relationship ended abruptly in 2010 after a brief but intense romance. However, it appears that the ""Wildest Dreams"" singer may be looking to rekindle their romance, with sources stating that she has been reaching out to Gyllenhaal through various means, including social media and phone calls.

While neither Swift nor Gyllenhaal has publicly confirmed the reports, fans of the couple are eagerly awaiting any developments in the situation. The prospect of a reunion between the two has sent shockwaves through the entertainment industry, with many speculating about the possibility of a renewed romance between the pop star and the actor.

Only time will tell if Swift and Gyllenhaal will indeed give their relationship another chance. For now, fans will have to keep their fingers crossed and wait for any official statements from the couple."

Trouble in Paradise: Kim Kardashian West Considering Divorce from Kanye West

In a shocking turn of events, it has been reported that Kim Kardashian West is considering divorcing her husband of nearly six years, Kanye West. According to sources close to the couple, the reality TV star is said to be ""ready to move on"" from her marriage, amidst rumors of Kanye's infidelity and increasingly strained relations between the two.

The news has sent shockwaves throughout the celebrity world, as the power couple has long been considered one of the most stable and enduring in Hollywood. However, insiders reveal that tensions have been simmering beneath the surface for months, with Kim reportedly feeling ""trapped"" in the marriage and ""desperate"" for a change.

Kanye, who has been open about his struggles with mental health and addiction in the past, has allegedly been unfaithful to Kim on multiple occasions, leading to a ""final straw"" in their relationship. Sources claim that Kim has been consulting with high-powered divorce attorneys in recent weeks, signaling that she may be prepared to take legal action against her estranged husband.

The split would mark the end of a tumultuous and often headline-grabbing relationship that has captivated the public for years. Kim and Kanye, who met in 2012 and married three years later, have four children together, including North, Saint, Chicago, and Psalm.

While neither Kim nor Kanye has publicly commented on the rumors, friends and family of the couple have been quick to defend them, insisting that the reports are ""not true"" and that the pair is simply going through a ""tough time."" However, with divorce rumors swirling and no sign of a reconciliation on the horizon, it seems that the end may be near for one of Hollywood's most high-profile marriages."

As the world continues to obsess over the latest celebrity couple, Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, a new challenge has emerged that threatens to derail their fairytale romance. Sources close to the couple reveal that Kanye's long-time best friends, Jay-Z and Beyonce, have been giving Kim the cold shoulder, and it's causing tension in the relationship.

According to an insider, Jay-Z and Beyonce have been deliberately avoiding Kim at social events and have even gone so far as to freeze her out of their inner circle. The reason for their animosity towards Kim is still unclear, but it's believed to be connected to Kanye's increasingly erratic behavior and his outspoken support for Donald Trump.

The question on everyone's mind is: can Kimye's love affair survive the cold shoulder from Kanye's best friends? The answer is far from certain, as history has shown that friendships can be just as powerful as romantic relationships in shaping our lives.

For Kim, who has always been fiercely independent and strong-willed, the snub from Jay-Z and Beyonce may be a difficult pill to swallow. She has always been the center of attention in her own right, and the thought of being marginalized by Kanye's friends may be a blow to her ego.

On the other hand, Kanye has always been a man who wears his heart on his sleeve, and his loyalty to his friends is unwavering. If he feels that his friends are being unfairly targeted or judged, he may be inclined to distance himself from Kim in order to protect them.

The fate of Kimye's relationship hangs in the balance, as the couple navigates this delicate situation. Will they be able to overcome the tension caused by Jay-Z and Beyonce's cold shoulder, or will it ultimately prove to be too much for their love to overcome? Only time will tell."

In case there are still people busying themselves wondering if Aniston is happy (just a note, she really doesn’t want you to), please stop. According to the latest tabloid reports, she’s doing just fine.

One man is reportedly a bachelor who recently split from his wife and the other is an “industry creative,” whatever that ever means. Neither of them is an actor.  But there’s no reason to believe we’ll learn more anytime soon. In July of 2016, Aniston wrote a pretty searing op-ed for HuffPost in which she scolded paparazzi that are constantly obsessed with whether she’s in love or having babies.  “For the record, I am not pregnant,” she wrote then. “What I am is fed up.

According to sources close to the couple, Aniston and Theroux have been leading separate lives for several months, with Aniston focusing on her acting career and Theroux working on his upcoming projects. The tension between them was palpable at the recent Academy Awards, where they were seen sitting apart from each other.

The news of their split comes as a surprise to many, as the couple had always been private about their relationship and never spoke publicly about their troubles. However, insiders say that the pressure of maintaining a high-profile celebrity marriage took a toll on their relationship, and they ultimately decided to go their separate ways.

The feature in Architectural Digest, which showcased the couple's beautiful midcentury home, was seen as a symbol of their love and commitment to each other. However, it now appears that the couple's relationship was already on shaky ground at the time of the publication.

Friends of the couple have expressed shock and sadness at the news, saying that they had always been a happy and loving couple. ""They were one of the most adorable couples in Hollywood, and it's heartbreaking to see them go,"" said one source.

The split between Aniston and Theroux is the latest in a string of high-profile celebrity breakups, and it has left many fans wondering what went wrong. However, it is important to respect the privacy of the couple and allow them the space to move forward with their lives.

(The marriage was annulled.) In the 24 years since then, he has been sued multiple times for inappropriate sexual contact with a minor (he settled out of court every time), and he was eventually charged with creating child pornography. (A jury found him not guilty on the grounds that they could not conclusively identify the other figure in his infamous sex tape as a child.) Last summer, he was accused of creating an abusive “sex cult” of very young women, whom he allegedly isolates, brainwashes, and abuses physically and emotionally. Since the story broke, multiple women have added their own testimonies of abuse at R. Kelly’s hands. (Through a lawyer, Kelly denied all accusations, saying he would “work diligently and forcibly to pursue his accusers and clear his name.”) And in April, another woman accused Kelly of “knowingly and intentionally infecting her with an STD.” Her lawyers say they are currently preparing a federal civil lawsuit. Through a spokesperson, Kelly issued a statement to the Washington Post in which he “categorically denies all claims and allegations.” As man after man has fallen to the #MeToo reckoning, losing jobs and retiring from public life after being accused of sexual harassment and assault, there’s been a recurring whisper: What about R. Kelly? Despite decades of lawsuits and allegations, Kelly’s career has marched steadily on. Last year, he finished an arena tour with a few cancellations. This year, he’s touring with singer Charlie Wilson (some protests are planned). His music appeared in Pitch Perfect 3. At this year’s Coachella, rapper Vince Staples repeatedly referred to Kelly as a “child molester” in an interview with Complex, insisting, “He pees on people.” In our post-#MeToo, post-Time’s Up, post-Harvey Weinstein world, and given the sheer volume of allegations against Kelly, it seems reasonable to raise the question of why he continues to work as much as he does. But Staples’s interviewer only giggled nervously and protested, “We can’t ever talk about this guy. ... You’re about to get me fired from Coachella. It’s my first time here.” Later, Staples tweeted that “R. Kelly people is looking for me.” ladies and gentlemen, vince staples on r kelly pic.twitter.com/SmZdYu9PNJ — andy (@aboynamedandy) April 16, 2018 That stasis may be starting to change. Most of the claims against Kelly were reiterated in a recent BBC Three documentary, R Kelly: Sex, Girls & Videotapes. And over the past year, at least five members of Kelly’s inner circle have left him. His assistant, his accountant, his lawyer, and his rep have all said that they no longer work for him, although none of them have gone into detail about their departures and all have been supportive and complimentary toward Kelly in their statements. His longtime musical accompanist, DJ Phantom, was less circumspect about his decision to leave Kelly in December: “I didn’t know then what I know now,” he said. “He’s a shitbag.” In April, the Women of Color committee within Time’s Up threw its weight behind the #MuteRKelly campaign, calling for anyone currently profiting from Kelly and his music to drop him, including Spotify, Ticketmaster, and Kelly’s record label, RCA. Shortly thereafter, Spotify announced that it would no longer be promoting Kelly’s music, although his music would remain in their streaming catalog. It’s possible that these new developlments mean things are changing for Kelly, and that he’s about to face lasting consequences for those accusations. But if that’s the case, those consequences took more than two decades to reach him. There is a persistent vagueness to the way we talk about R.

R. Kelly's Time May Have Finally Come

After years of accusations and controversy, it appears that R. Kelly's time may have finally come. The embattled R&B singer has been accused of sexual relationships with minors going back to 1994, when he married 15-year-old pop star Aaliyah. The allegations, which have been circulating for decades, have finally gained momentum in recent months, with multiple women coming forward with their own stories of abuse and exploitation at the hands of the singer.

The latest development in the case comes from a report by BuzzFeed News, which claims that Kelly has been accused of sexual relationships with underage girls as young as 12 years old. The report also alleges that Kelly's inner circle, including his management team and friends, were aware of his behavior and actively covered it up.

The allegations against Kelly are not new, but they have gained renewed attention in recent months, particularly after the release of the documentary ""Surviving R. Kelly"" in January. The documentary featured interviews with several women who accused Kelly of sexual abuse and manipulation, and it sparked a renewed outcry against the singer.

Since then, several high-profile celebrities have spoken out against Kelly, including Lady Gaga and Celine Dion, who have both apologized for collaborating with him in the past. Additionally, several major record labels and music industry figures have distanced themselves from Kelly, and his music has been removed from several streaming platforms.

The latest report from BuzzFeed News has only added fuel to the fire, with many calling for Kelly to be held accountable for his actions. The singer has repeatedly denied all allegations of sexual misconduct, but the mounting evidence against him may be too much to ignore.

It remains to be seen what the future holds for R. Kelly, but one thing is certain: his time may have finally come.

gossipcop-7489249320,1,0,"Mark Wahlberg has come a long way from his Funky Bunch days. The successful actor has an important message for anti-Trump celebrities.  While being interviewed for Task & Purpose for his new movie “Patriots Day,” Wahlberg went after celebrities who “lined up to denounce Donald Trump is the months and weeks leading up to Election Day.”  “A lot of celebrities did, do, and shouldn’t,” he told the magazine. “You know, it just goes to show you that people aren’t listening to that anyways. They might buy your CD or watch your movie, but you don’t put food on their table. You don’t pay their bills.”  “A lot of Hollywood is living in a bubble,” Wahlberg continued. “They’re pretty out of touch with the common person, the everyday guy out there providing for their family. Me, I’m very aware of the real world. I come from the real world and I exist in the real world. And although I can navigate Hollywood and I love the business and the opportunities it’s afforded me, I also understand what it’s like not to have all that.”  Wahlberg’s point is well taken. What makes Hollywood liberals qualified to speak on politics? They should have respect for the President of the United States.  Do you agree?","Here is the news piece based on the sentence:

Mark Wahlberg, the actor known for his iconic roles in films like ""Boogie Nights"" and ""The Fighter,"" has come a long way from his Funky Bunch days. But despite his success, Wahlberg is sending an important message to his fellow celebrities who are vocal in their opposition to President Trump.

In an exclusive interview with our news outlet, Wahlberg emphasized the importance of unity and respect for the office of the President, even if one disagrees with the current administration's policies.

""As celebrities, we have a platform to make a difference, but we also have a responsibility to use that platform wisely,"" Wahlberg said. ""I may not agree with the President on everything, but I respect the office and the democratic process. I hope that my fellow celebrities will take a step back and think about the impact their words and actions have on the country.""

Wahlberg's message comes at a time when tensions are high in the entertainment industry, with many celebrities using their platforms to speak out against the President and his policies. While Wahlberg acknowledges the right of celebrities to express their opinions, he urges them to consider the potential consequences of their words and actions.

""We have to be mindful of the impact we have on our fans and the country as a whole,"" Wahlberg said. ""We can make a difference by using our platform to bring people together, rather than driving them further apart.""

Wahlberg's message is a call to action for his fellow celebrities to use their platform for good, rather than fueling the divisions that exist in our society. As the country continues to grapple with the challenges of the Trump presidency, Wahlberg's message of unity and respect is a reminder that we all have a role to play in shaping the future of our nation."

Here’s how the Biebs is coping with his time apart from Sel.  Justin Bieber, 24, is going through a tough time as his relationship with Selena Gomez, 25, is on pause. She’s currently on vacation with friends in Sydney, Australia, where she appears to be carefree in this new video. However, a source reveals that the same can’t be said for Bieber. “Justin has Selena on the brain constantly. He is trying to drown it out by hanging with friends and doing stuff on his own time but he keeps thinking about her,” a source EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com. “He always wants to be around her, talk to her and be with her. She is like a drug for him, he just needs more and more and more.”  As the Biebs continues to struggle with their time apart, he’s got a few things up his sleeve for when she returns to LA. “He can’t wait until she is back because he wants to really wine and dine her upon her return and really kick start the relationship back up again,” the insider reveals. It’s unclear when Sel is scheduled to return to the West Coast. But, as seen on her Instagram, she is having the time of her life. She posted a video which showed her laughing on a boat, accompanied by a subliminal message, that she “chose” to take care of herself, “not to prove anything to anyone.” Was she trying to give us insight into her most recent split with Bieber?  Jelena fans went into panic mode after seeing Sel in the arms of another man on a boat on March 19. She was photographed hugging and goofing off in photos with Sydney native, Johnny Rays. While all signs point to a friendship between the two, the photos didn’t appear that way to some fans who claimed they looked too close for comfort.  While Sel has been vacationing Down Under, Bieber has been staying active. He’s been photographed playing hockey and soccer with friends. However, his emotions may be getting the best of him as he took a gnarly fall during a soccer game on March 19, and seemingly broke down on the sidelines of a hockey game on March 17.  As you may recall, Jelena reunited in October 2017, after her split with The Weeknd, 28. They seemed inseparable, having spent New Year’s together in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. However, their romance took a rocky turn around Bieber’s birthday on March 1, according to reports.","Justin Bieber is reportedly struggling to cope with his recent split from Selena Gomez, as she appears to be moving on just fine with her Australian vacation.

The source tells HollywoodLife.com exclusively that Bieber is ""hurting"" and ""can't seem to shake off the pain"" of their breakup.

Meanwhile, Gomez has been enjoying her time down under, posting smiling photos and videos on social media that show her soaking up the sun and having a great time. The contrast between her happy demeanor and Bieber's reported struggles is not going unnoticed by fans, who are taking to social media to offer their support and words of encouragement to the heartbroken singer.

While it's unclear if Bieber and Gomez will ever reconcile, it's clear that the breakup has left him reeling. Our source notes that Bieber is ""taking it one day at a time"" and ""focusing on his music and his fans"" as he navigates this difficult time."

gossipcop-28284230,1,0,"Not so fast! Madonna was hit with a series of “uncomfortable questions” by a judge before she was granted permission to adopt her 4-year-old twin girls from Malawi, the presiding judge said in court documents obtained by The Associated Press on Wednesday, February 8.  “The petitioner is a professional performer and I guarded myself against the danger of her merely reciting a well-rehearsed speech by asking her some rather uncomfortable questions to which she gave very candid answers,” Judge Fiona Mwale said in her ruling, explaining her reasons for approving the adoption.  After pressing Madonna, 58, to explain her intentions in adding two more little ones to her brood of four, Judge Mwale said she was satisfied that the girls would be in good hands with the Material Girl.  “There is no doubt that the petitioner can offer the infants not only the best education money can buy, but also guidance with a high likelihood of ensuring that the two infants grow to be self-sufficient adults,” Judge Mwale said, adding that she is satisfied that Madonna “is motivated by her desire to offer a home, love, protection and guidance to the infants.”  In the court documents, Judge Mwale addressed prior controversies surrounding Madonna’s adoptions in Malawi. “In determining her motives, I questioned the petitioner at length about the impact of her decision which could be construed as robbing Malawi of its most precious resource, its children,” the judge wrote.  As previously reported, Madonna filed for adoption in High Court in Malawi on January 25 but tried to keep the process under wraps until a final decision was made. (The Queen of Pop issued a statement denying her adoption to Us Weekly that same day, claiming that she was in Malawi “to check on the children’s hospital in Blantyre.”) According to the AP, she has already raised $7.5 million for a pediatric surgery ward at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, which is set to open early next year.  Madonna previously adopted son David and daughter Mercy James, both 11, from Malawi in 2008 and 2009, respectively. She is also mom to daughter Lourdes, 20, whom she shares with ex Carlos Leon, and son Rocco, 16, whom she shares with ex-husband Guy Ritchie.  Madonna’s twin girls will retain their birth names as a part of an effort to preserve their identity as Malawian nationals, the court documents said, and their father was at the January 25 court hearing with Madonna. (The twins’ mother died within a week of childbirth due to health complications.)  On Wednesday, February 8, Madonna took to social media to share the happy news. “I can officially confirm I have completed the process of adopting twin sisters from Malawi and am overjoyed that they are now part of our family,” she captioned an image of herself walking between the two little girls. “I am deeply grateful to all those in Malawi who helped make this possible, and I ask the media please to respect our privacy during this transitional time. 🙏🏻 Thank you also to my friends, family and my very large team for all your support and Love!”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!

The judge said he had to ask some tough questions to ensure the pop star was fit to be a mother to the girls.

According to the court documents, the judge asked Madonna about her plans for the girls' upbringing, including their education, religion, and whether she would raise them in the United States or Malawi. The judge also inquired about Madonna's own upbringing and how she would ensure the girls would be raised with the same values and beliefs as her own children.

The judge also asked about Madonna's career and how it would affect the girls' lives, as well as her plans for their future. The judge said he wanted to ensure that the girls would be raised in a stable and loving home.

Despite the tough questions, the judge ultimately granted Madonna's adoption request, saying she had proven herself to be a fit and loving mother. The judge's decision was met with cheers from Madonna's supporters in the courtroom.

In a statement, Madonna thanked the judge for his thorough review of her application and vowed to provide a loving and stable home for her new daughters. She also praised the Malawian court system for its fairness and professionalism.

The adoption of the twin girls, whose names are Estere and Stelle, brings the total number of children Madonna has adopted from Malawi to four. She has two other children, David Banda and Mercy James, who were also adopted from the country."

Recently, I have come across a disturbing report about Ellen DeGeneres and her wife Portia de Rossi. According to aceshowbiz.com, Portia has been struggling with their marital problems and has resorted to self-harming behaviors.

Sources close to the couple have revealed that Portia has been cutting her wrists as a way to cope with the stress and tension that has been building in their relationship. This is a deeply troubling development, and it is important that we take a closer look at the factors that may have contributed to this situation.

First and foremost, it is important to acknowledge that Portia's struggles are not a reflection on her own personal failings. Self-harm is a common symptom of deeper issues, such as depression, anxiety, and trauma. It is not uncommon for individuals to turn to self-harm as a way to cope with overwhelming emotions and feelings of helplessness.

Furthermore, it is important to recognize that Ellen and Portia's relationship has been under scrutiny for some time now. The couple has been married for over a decade, and while they have always presented a united front to the public, there have been rumors of tension and infidelity. It is possible that these underlying issues have contributed to Portia's struggles.

As a society, we need to take a closer look at the impact that celebrity culture can have on individuals and relationships. The pressure to maintain a perfect image can be overwhelming, and it can lead to unhealthy behaviors such as self-harm and substance abuse. We need to support our celebrities and hold them accountable for their well-being, rather than perpetuating a culture of silence and stigma.

In conclusion, the news that Portia de Rossi has been struggling with self-harm is a sobering reminder of the challenges that even the most seemingly perfect celebrities can face. We need to take a closer look at the factors that may have contributed to this situation, and we need to support Portia and Ellen as they work through these issues.

Title: ""Hollywood Actor Admits to Being 'Wasted' During Filming""

Date: March 25, 2023

Los Angeles, CA - In a shocking revelation, a well-known Hollywood actor has admitted to being ""wasted"" throughout the entirety of his recent film project. Speaking with The Times in an exclusive interview, the actor confessed that he was under the influence of alcohol and drugs during the entire filming process.

""I just got wasted the whole time,"" the actor revealed, ""You feel insane, but I think the studio cut my days because I started speaking total gibberish. I was like a broken record.""

The actor, who wishes to remain anonymous, starred in a highly anticipated summer blockbuster that has been receiving mixed reviews from critics. While the film has performed well at the box office, many have noted that the actor's performance was subpar and lacked the usual depth and nuance that he is known for.

Now, it seems that the reason for this may be due to the actor's state of intoxication during filming. According to sources close to the production, the actor was frequently late to set and often slurred his lines, causing delays and frustration for the rest of the cast and crew.

When asked about the allegations, the actor confirmed that he had been struggling with addiction during the filming process, but maintained that he was still able to deliver a good performance despite his state.

""I don't think my addiction affected my performance,"" he said, ""I'm still proud of the work I did, and I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to be a part of such a great project.""

However, industry insiders are skeptical of the actor's claims, and many are speculating that his addiction may have played a role in the film's less-than-stellar reception.

""It's unfortunate that this talented actor has fallen victim to addiction,"" said one industry insider, ""Hopefully, he can seek the help he needs and get back to doing what he does best - making great movies.""

The actor's admission has sparked a wider conversation about the prevalence of addiction in the entertainment industry, and the need for more support and resources for those struggling with substance abuse.

In a statement, a spokesperson for the studio behind the film said, ""We take any allegations of substance abuse very seriously, and we will be conducting a thorough investigation into the matter. We are committed to providing a safe and healthy work environment for all of our employees and cast members.""

For now, the fate of the actor's career and the future of the film remain uncertain. One thing is clear, however - the entertainment industry must do more to support those struggling with addiction, and to ensure that the sets of our movies and television shows are safe and healthy for everyone involved."

Ricky got me good! I was so happy that I couldn’t quit smiling. My cheeks hurt!”  The 31-year-old fertility nurse met sales manager Angel on the dating app Bumble (“Ladies pick — finally it was my choice,” jokes Bischoff) last September; the couple moved in together in May.  “On our first date, we just clicked,” she says. “It was easy and that’s the way it should be.”  Still, Bischoff admits it was “nerve-wracking” to jump back into the dating scene after her painful split from Soules in 2015, nearly seven months after they were engaged. “I was still a little bit broken and trying to pick up the pieces. But from day one there was open communication with Ricky about what I had gone through. I think one of the reasons I fell in love so quickly is that I could say everything and know I was not being judged.”  Bischoff hasn’t spoken to Soules recently but says she wishes him well. “I hope that he meets someone, if he hasn’t already, just as great for him and Ricky is for me.”  Now, Bischoff still watches The Bachelor, but says she’s moved on from her own reality show past. “That journey was a big part of my life,” she says. “But since I’ve met Ricky, I really haven’t looked back.”  Busy with wedding plans (the couple are looking at a date next fall), Bischoff says she nonetheless has positive associations with the show. “It’s sad that it ended the way it had to end, but I was still looking for that perfect someone. I didn’t let my past close off my heart. Everything works out for a reason.”","Answer:

Whitney Bischoff, the former Bachelor star who captured the hearts of millions with her journey on the reality dating show, chose to forgo the glitz and glamour of a televised proposal in favor of a more intimate and personal moment with her fiancé Ricky Angel.

Something as simple as a picture of Aniston with her hand on her stomach is proof enough for some tabloids that the actress is expecting a baby. Now, a new report claims that the Friends star has hired a surrogate, could there be any truth to the story?  In the new issue of Star, the tabloid features the headline, “Jen To Justin: I’ll Raise Our Baby Alone!” followed by a story that asserts Aniston wants to become a mom, and she will do it with or without her husband. The publication claims to have a source that reveals Aniston’s marriage is “on the rocks,” and she is planning to be a single mom.  ?…❤️✌️ A post shared by @justintheroux on Aug 5, 2017 at 4:23pm PDT  “Privately, she has told friends that she’s secretly gone ahead and hired a surrogate mother to carry her child to birth. And she’s vowed to raise the baby alone,” tells the insider.  But then the source says the actress is hoping to choose the right woman soon, completely contradicting the earlier quote, which is a huge red flag that something isn’t right with this claim.  But many think the tabloid story is completely false and contradictory quotes prove the story is garbage, questioning why the insider is sharing such private and secret information with a tabloid.  This is the same magazine that published a story earlier this year claiming Aniston herself was pregnant, but then didn’t mention that at all in its latest baby claims.  Aniston told Glamour magazine back in August that not only are the pregnancy tabloid stories guilty of body shaming, but they are also an invasion into a private matter between her and her husband. She said it is no one’s business whether or not she has a baby.  Jennifer Aniston went on to say that the subject of having a baby is a sensitive topic for her, and no one has the right to judge other people’s choices.

Ever since Jennifer Aniston married Justin Theroux, pregnancy rumors have followed the couple like a shadow. The latest speculation suggests that the actress is expecting a baby, with some tabloids claiming that a recent picture of Aniston with her hand on her stomach is proof enough of her pregnancy.

Despite the constant rumors, neither Aniston nor Theroux has confirmed or denied the speculation. However, sources close to the couple have denied the pregnancy rumors, stating that Aniston is not expecting a baby.

The pregnancy rumors began shortly after Aniston and Theroux tied the knot in a private ceremony in August 2015. Since then, the couple has been the subject of constant media attention, with many tabloids and gossip websites reporting on their every move.

While the pregnancy rumors have yet to be confirmed, it's clear that the couple is enjoying their married life together. Aniston and Theroux have been spotted on several public outings, including a recent trip to Hawaii, where they were seen soaking up the sun and enjoying each other's company.

For now, fans will have to wait and see if Aniston and Theroux will welcome a baby into their lives. But one thing is certain: the couple's love for each other is stronger than ever, and they are living their lives to the fullest."
gossipcop-5840642713,1,1,"Sky high prices are reportedly keeping fans from buying tickets to Taylor Swift’s upcoming Reputation tour, per a story by the New York Post. Though her 1989 world tour boasted numerous sold out performances (it eventually became the highest grossing tour of 2015), it appears her considerably more expensive snake persona is a tougher sell.  Last month, her “longtime” tour promoter told Billboard, “By the time all the tickets are sold next week, I’ll be celebrating Taylor’s birthday with a cocktail in my hand and sold-out concerts all over the world.” But her birthday has come and gone, and not one date has sold out.  Reputation was the biggest-selling album of 2017 and the tour is shaping up to be far from ill-attended, so the Post’s headline, “Taylor Swift’s Reputation tour shaping up to be a disaster,” is a little much. It does, however, highlight the problems with unpredictable pricing, scalpers, and Ticketmaster in general.  The company’s “Verified Fan” program, which they would like you to believe is all about rewarding music lovers, appears to be nothing but a cash grab that takes advantage of Swift-obsessed teens with easy access to their parents’ credit card numbers. People willing to drop $50 on merch, the Post reports, could “improve [their] position in line to purchase tickets.” And, once accessible, the tickets are often too expensive for many fans.  “I paid $150 for my ticket with amazing seats for the 1989 tour,” one fan wrote. “Now for the same seats I have to pay about $500.”  Advertisement  In related news, tickets to Katy Perry’s Friday show in New Orleans are currently starting at $23.","Taylor Swift's Reputation tour is one of the most highly anticipated music events of the year, but high ticket prices may be keeping some fans from attending. According to a report by the New York Post, prices for tickets to the tour have skyrocketed, with some seats selling for over $1,000. This has led to concerns that many of Swift's devoted followers may be priced out of the opportunity to see her perform live.

The report notes that tickets for Swift's previous tours have typically ranged in price from $50 to $200, but this time around, prices have jumped significantly. Some fans have taken to social media to express their disappointment and frustration at the high prices, with one fan tweeting, ""I've been a Taylor Swift fan for years, but I can't afford to go to her concert.""

The high ticket prices have also led to speculation about the reason behind the increase. Some have pointed to the fact that Swift has not gone on tour in three years, and that demand for tickets is likely to be high. Others have noted that the tour is being produced by Live Nation, a company that has been criticized for its ticketing practices in the past.

Regardless of the reason, it's clear that the high ticket prices are causing some fans to reconsider their plans to attend the tour. As one fan put it, ""I love Taylor Swift, but I can't justify spending that much money on tickets."" The situation has left many fans feeling frustrated and disappointed, and it remains to be seen how the high prices will affect ticket sales for the tour."

(Buchanan County Sheriff via AP) Iowa farmer Chris Soules, a former star on ABC’s “The Bachelor” who charmed reality TV viewers with his small-town life, was arrested this week after police said he fled a crash that killed a fellow farmer. Soules, 35, was charged with leaving the scene of a fatal crash, a class D felony, and could face up to five years in prison if he is convicted. The case has garnered the attention of Soules’s “Bachelor” fans as well as residents of Arlington, Iowa, where he lives, who had come to appreciate the reality TV star’s work as an unofficial Iowa ambassador and farm industry advocate. “This story is going to spread like wildfire around here and probably all over because of who he is,” Mary Jo Brown, Arlington’s city clerk, told the Des Moines Register. “Sometimes fame isn’t your friend.” Soules, who also appeared in “Dancing with the Stars” and “Worst Chefs in America,” called 911 at 8:20 p.m. Monday evening to report that he had rear-ended a tractor on a rural road north of the tiny town of Aurora, about six miles away from his home. The tractor veered into a ditch after being struck by his 2008 Chevrolet Silverado, Soules said. The tractor driver — later identified as 66-year-old Kenneth Mosher, a Vietnam War veteran — was unconscious and not breathing, Soules told the 911 operator, according to audio obtained by local media. The man had a pulse, but there was blood around his mouth, Soules said. Soules identified himself on the call, which lasted nearly six minutes, and sounded frantic. Between heavy breathing, he answered the dispatcher’s questions and took instructions. Soules told the 911 operator he did not know how to perform CPR and could be heard asking unidentified people at the scene if they could perform the lifesaving measure. The call ended abruptly after the operator told Soules law enforcement and medical first responders were on the way. “Can I, can I call you back really quick?” Soules asked the dispatcher. “Yeah, you can call me back,” she says. “Thank you,” Soules responds. Soules left the crash site after emergency responders arrived, but before deputies with the Buchanan County Sheriff’s Office were on the scene, according to authorities. Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Scott Bright told the Des Moines Register that Soules fled the scene on foot and later got into a truck. In police audio obtained by local media, a deputy told a dispatcher that Soules “took off” in a red truck. Authorities are trying to identify who picked up Soules in the truck, Buchanan County Sheriff Bill Wolfgram told the Associated Press. That person could face charges, he said. Alcohol was found at the scene and investigators are trying to determine whose it was and whether it or speed were factors in the crash. Soules was arrested about five hours after the incident and booked into the Buchanan County Jail, the Associated Press reported. He posted a $10,000 bond Tuesday morning and was released on the condition that he surrender his passport and wear an electronic monitor. During his first appearance in court, the Buchanan County assistant attorney told the judge that Soules refused to cooperate with law enforcement after they located him at his home. He “would not come out,” the attorney said, until officials obtained a search warrant, which “took hours.” Chris Soules making his initial court appearance in Buchanan County @KWWL pic.twitter.com/72bvEg0wVR — Elizabeth Amanieh (@EAmaniehKWWL) April 25, 2017 Wolfgram told the Associated Press that investigators were “running into some roadblocks when it comes to getting information” but acknowledged Soules was acting within his constitutional rights.

Reality TV Star Chris Soules Arrested After Fatal Car Crash

Buchanan County, Iowa - Former ""Bachelor"" star Chris Soules was arrested on Tuesday after he allegedly fled the scene of a fatal car crash that killed a fellow farmer. According to police, Soules was driving a pickup truck when he struck a tractor on a rural road, causing the death of the tractor's driver.

Soules, 35, was taken into custody after a witness reportedly saw him leave the scene of the crash. He was later booked into the Buchanan County Jail on charges of leaving the scene of an accident resulting in death, a serious misdemeanor.

The identity of the victim has not been released, but local authorities say the man was a fellow farmer who lived in the area. The investigation into the crash is ongoing, and police are asking anyone with information to come forward.

Soules rose to fame on the ABC reality show ""The Bachelor"" in 2015, where he charmed viewers with his small-town life and down-to-earth personality. Since the show ended, he has continued to work as a farmer and has appeared on several other reality TV shows.

""They have been sleeping in separate bedrooms for a while now,"" a source told RadarOnline.com. ""It's not a permanent situation, but it's not a temporary one either. They are taking some time apart to figure things out.""

It's unclear what exactly is causing the tension between Kim and Kanye, but it's clear that they are going through a difficult time. Despite their efforts to work through their issues, it seems that they are still struggling to find a resolution.

Her frantic traveling all over the place was an attempt at keeping Pitt away from her and and any other person who might think they were a friend. She can't stand anyone but her having anything to do with Pitt . Including his own family. I knew it would backfire one day. Brad what took so long????? She suffers from an extreme mental illness. She doesn't have the kids in school for the same reason.  I do believe she thought it would last. Seeing how sexy and pretty she thinks she is. A man should and would do anything she tells them to.  I am under the impression her treatment of her surrogate Holly had a sort of wake up call to Pitt as to how utterly evil she is. You can bet she dismissed her like a piece of shite. A woman who carried twins for her. Started making Brad see her game of using and abusing.

Her spells have lost the power to confuse.In Touch said she has a terrible jealous streak and can't stand Brad even looking at a woman SHE DEEMS ATTRACTIVE IN ANY WAY. WE ALL KNOW HOW MUCH FUN THAT CAN BE.    The National Enquirer  Says Brad is so happy to have a separation from her.Brad's closest friends are woman and that drives Angelina nuts she hates sharing him  He was mad she took the salt role because she had promised him she would stay at home and be a mom.  I mean you can see her doing whatever she damn well wanted to. And he went along with it. But they have twin babies and my guess is she spends very little time bonding with them. What woman would not want to be able to stay with her new little babies. Not this woman. Sick behavior for sure. And the only thing keeping Brad from making it final is the kids.

Oscar Night Disaster: Hollywood Insider Reveals Shocking Details

Los Angeles, CA - In an exclusive interview with a Hollywood insider, we have learned that this year's Academy Awards show took a disastrous turn for one of its attendees. According to the source, Jen, a prominent figure in the entertainment industry, experienced a series of unfortunate events following her appearance at the prestigious award ceremony.

""Things started going downhill after Jen was at the Academy Awards show,"" the insider revealed. ""She was involved in a heated argument with one of the presenters, and things only got worse from there.""

The source went on to describe how Jen's behavior became increasingly erratic, causing a scene that left several attendees in shock. ""She was yelling at people, causing a ruckus, and even got into a physical altercation with one of the security guards,"" the insider claimed.

When asked about the specific details of the altercation, the source declined to comment, stating that the information was ""too sensitive"" to discuss. However, the insider did reveal that the incident was so severe that it prompted a formal investigation by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

The fallout from the incident has reportedly been severe, with several high-profile industry figures distancing themselves from Jen. ""Her reputation has been irreparably damaged,"" the insider stated. ""She's lost several lucrative endorsement deals and her career is likely over.""

The Academy has yet to release an official statement regarding the incident, but sources close to the organization have confirmed that they are taking the matter very seriously.

This shocking revelation has left the entertainment industry reeling, and fans of Jen are left wondering what the future holds for the embattled star. One thing is certain, however: the glamour and glitz of the Academy Awards show has been tarnished by this disturbing incident."

There comes a time in every couple's relationship when the question of moving in together becomes impossible to ignore. And when those two lovebirds have been stepping out for 15 months — even though they live 3,500 miles apart; he in the UK, she in Canada — it's not so much a case of 'if' as of 'when' they will settle down. So it comes as no surprise that Prince Harry, 33, and his actress girlfriend Meghan Markle, 36, are said to be house-hunting. £7.25million - North Aston Manor, Oxfordshire: This eight bedroom property, overlooking the stunning Cherwell Valley, has seven reception rooms, a spa, swimming pool and 18.2 acres with equestrian facilities. It's nine miles from Soho Farmhouse and swanky shopping centre Bicester Village, should Meghan fancy snapping up some designer bargains Prince Harry and actress girlfriend Meghan Markle were pictured together at the Invictus Games in Toronto last month Royal sources have exclusively told the Daily Mail that the royal couple are looking in Oxfordshire and are particularly interested in high-end properties tucked away in the rolling Cotswold hills. A good friend of Harry's says the Prince, whose father's residence, Highgrove House, is in the south Cotswolds, has a long-standing affection for the area, while Meghan is said to be entranced by its rustic charm. 'He is searching for a new home in the area,' the friend reveals. 'Before Meghan, he was vaguely looking in Norfolk, but didn't find what he wanted. Now, with her input, he's renewed his search.' £2million - The Old Rectory, Lower Brailes, Oxfordshire: A stunning wood-panelled property dating from the 14th century, this boasts eight bedrooms, a sun-drenched terrace and its own private lake, complete with duck house. There’s a three-bedroom coach house for guests and it’s set at the end of a no-through road. Certainly, the lush green countryside encompassing swathes of Warwickshire, Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire is a huge draw for London-dwellers eager to snap up rural boltholes. Just an hour or so from the capital, it's home (or at least a weekend retreat) to A-listers, politicians and media executives: the Camerons, Beckhams, Kate Moss, Lily Allen and Stella McCartney all have million-pound properties in the area. 'It's like a magnet,' says Sophie Gannon, of Savills Estate Agents in Banbury, Oxfordshire. 'If you get one person, you get them all.' However, Harry isn't following the crowd but listening to his heart. The Cotswolds, and specifically Highgrove, which was bought by his father's private estate in 1980, is where the Prince spent much of his childhood. It was Charles and Diana's weekend home, with 15-acre grounds and, later on, a teenage haven in the cellars of the main house, which Harry nicknamed 'Club H'. £2.95million - Fanthill, Banbury, Oxfordshire: Accessed through electric gates, up a winding driveway, this eight-bedroom house sits among 20 acres of land, so ticks all Harry’s boxes when it comes to privacy. There’s a heated outdoor pool, miniature golf course and a carp lake, where the young lovebirds could row off the private pier A local who knows the family says: 'It's not surprising that Harry would like to live where he feels at home. 'He's lived in the Cotswolds all his life and often returns to visit his father. After his mother died, it became a place of sanctuary. 'When the boys entered their teens, Charles bought several homes in the area, thinking they might want one in the future.' Ten years ago, Charles bought up properties adjacent to his sprawling estate, paying £2 million apiece for nearby manor houses and farm buildings. But sources say rather than living off his father's generosity, Harry wants to invest in a place of his own. £4.25million - Cross Hill House, Adderbury, Oxfordshire: This 10-bedroom house, surrounded by landscaped","---

Forget Wills and Kate's dusty old Norfolk. The lovebirds want to hang out with the groovy set in the Cotswolds - and the local estate agents' eyes are lighting up.

In a shocking turn of events, Prince William and Kate Middleton have reportedly set their sights on the trendy Cotswolds region as their next destination for royal residency. According to sources close to the couple, they are eager to ditch their traditional Norfolk home and join the ""groovy set"" in the picturesque Cotswolds, known for its upscale boutiques, gourmet restaurants, and hip bars.

The news has sent local estate agents into a frenzy, with many speculating that the Prince and Princess are likely to purchase a stylish and modern property in the area. ""We have already received numerous inquiries from potential buyers looking for properties that fit the couple's alleged preferences,"" said one local estate agent, who wished to remain anonymous. ""The Cotswolds is a very desirable location, and the prospect of the Royals joining our community has certainly generated a lot of excitement.""

The move would mark a significant departure from the traditional royal lifestyle that William and Kate have embraced so far. The Cotswolds, with its bohemian vibe and liberal attitudes, is a far cry from the more formal and conservative environment of Norfolk. However, the couple's desire for a more relaxed and modern lifestyle is not surprising, given their reputation for being more down-to-earth and accessible than previous generations of Royals.

The Cotswolds is also home to a number of celebrities and high-profile figures, and the Prince and Princess are likely to find themselves in good company. ""We have a thriving arts and culture scene here, and the Royals would be welcome additions to our community,"" said one local resident, who wished to remain anonymous. ""We are known for our open-mindedness and inclusiveness, and we would be thrilled to have the Royals join us.""

While no official announcement has been made, sources close to the couple suggest that they are serious about the move and have already begun looking at properties in the area. The Cotswolds, here they come!"
gossipcop-2365987922,1,0,"Jenny and her silk pillowcases.  It’s no secret that Jennifer Lopez-at 48-has a body that won’t quit and skin that needs to be studied so we can all age like the goddess she is.  Dramatic? Not even close.  And while a lot of it may be down to great genes, Lopez has revealed in a new interview some of her beauty secrets and yep, they’re as diva as you might expect.  Lopez credits her glow to positive affirmations, revealing she says one in particular to herself every day to keep her radiant, youthful look intact.  So what is this magic phrase?  “I am youthful and timeless at every age,” Lopez says every single day—but it’s not enough to just say the mantra daily, because Lopez also has a handful of pillows with these words and more mantras embroidered into them all over her home. “I tell myself that every day, a few times a day. It sounds like clichéd bullshit, but it’s not: Age is all in your mind. Look at Jane Fonda.”  Lopez continues, “The affirmations are everywhere. I forget that they’re all here. They’re just part of the house now.”  Before you scoff at Lopez’s positivity there is a school of thought that believes negative thoughts can age you. Australian-born Dr Blackburn, a Nobel Prize winner, co-authored The Telomere Effect: A Revolutionary Approach to Living Younger, Healthier, Longer, with anti-aging psychologist Dr Elissa Epel, which investigated the link between telomeres, which protect our chromosomes, and the effect stress, sleep and diet can have on telomeres and how that directly corresponds with our health.  The book asserts there is a correlation between depression and anxiety and shorter telomeres and that “when pessimists develop an aging-related illness, like cancer or heart disease, the illness tends to progress faster.”  And really there's only so far a little highlight can go, step one is all about a positive attitude. Step two is to find yourself a great pillowcase and settle on your new mantra.  So what’s the lesson here? Your inner glow is only a glass half full attitude away.","And while we’ve already given plenty of praise to her skincare routine (she swears by an $80 moisturizer), it’s time to turn our attention to her bedtime routine.

Specifically, to the silk pillowcases she swears by. Jenny has long been a fan of silk pillowcases, and she’s not alone: Silk pillowcases are a popular choice among celebrities and skin experts alike. But what makes them so special? For starters, silk is hypoallergenic and breathable, which means it won’t irritate your skin or cause breakouts. Plus, it’s soft and smooth, which makes it perfect for sensitive skin. But here’s the real kicker: silk pillowcases can actually help prevent wrinkles and fine lines. How? By allowing your skin to slide smoothly over the pillowcase, silk reduces friction and tugging on your skin while you sleep, which can cause those unwanted creases.

Of course, we’re not the only ones who think silk pillowcases are a game-changer. Jennifer Aniston, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Kate Middleton are all fans, too. And it’s not hard to see why: Not only do silk pillowcases feel luxurious, but they’re also surprisingly affordable (you can find them for under $30). So if you’re looking to get your hands on a set of your own, you’re in luck: There are plenty of options available online. But act fast-we have a feeling these pillowcases won’t be available for long."

Each time Channing and Jenna head to mediation to discuss the terms of their divorce, “they can’t seem to agree on anything,” says a source. “Their meetings have been contentious.” One big issue: their five-year-old daughter, Everly. “They can’t agree on custody,” a friend tells In Touch exclusively.      Unicorns do exist. A post shared by Channing Tatum (@channingtatum) on May 4, 2018 at 6:40pm PDT      “They’re both working hard to do what’s in the best interest of their daughter, but it’s just taking way longer than they both expected because they can’t agree on the small details.” Another sticking point: Channing’s estimated $60 million fortune. Though Jenna, 37, has had a successful movie and TV career with shows like Supergirl, Channing, 38, has starred in several blockbusters, such as Magic Mike and 21 Jump Street, and was the family’s main breadwinner. “Jenna has told friends that she gave Channing the best years of her life,” says the source, “and now she’s trying to negotiate a very secure future for herself.”  There is a lot at stake financially. During the course of their marriage, the pair acquired several assets, including a $6 million Beverly Hills home and pricey cars including a Tesla and a vintage Chevrolet truck. Finding common ground about dividing their stuff “is not easy,” says the friend. “They both want it to be over with.”          Jenna never thought it would come to this. “She isn’t pleased about how it’s all played out so far,” says the source. “She’s bitter. There are days when she’s blaming him for not working harder to save their marriage.” And while she’s told pals that she hopes they can stay friends, adds the source, deep down “she knows that’s never going to happen.”  Channing shouldn’t underestimate Jenna, says the source: “She’s looking out for herself, and at the end of the day she knows that he’s got to pay. She’s not going to walk away quietly.”  For more on this, pick up the latest issue of In Touch — and for more exclusive content sign up for our newsletter.

From “cool pants” to clover emojis, there’s a lot of backstory that needs explaining in order to completely understand everything that went down among Kanye West and Wiz Khalifa and Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna. To keep you informed, Us Weekly has broken it down with a comprehensive timeline of events. Kanye West Dates Amber Rose In 2008, the Grammy-winning rapper started a relationship with unknown model Rose after spotting her in Ludacris’ “What Them Girls Like” music video. The pair had a public two-year romance. Amber Rose Breaks Up With Kanye West In mid-2010, Rose called things off with West. A year after the split, Rose appeared on The Wendy Williams Show, noting, “[Kanye] said that he was an a-hole and he was mean to me and he didn’t treat me the way he was supposed to. I accepted his apology because I feel like he’s remorseful for how he treated me.” Blac Chyna and Tyga Have a Son, Get Engaged Meanwhile, an up-and-coming rapper named Tyga welcomed a baby boy named King Cairo Stevenson with his then-girlfriend, model Blac Chyna, in October 2012. “Most amazing feeling ever. #Blessed #2Kings,” Tyga captioned a Twitter photo cradling his little boy. That December, the couple confirmed they were engaged in an Instagram post featuring Chyna’s giant diamond ring. Kanye West Starts Dating Kim Kardashian Fresh off his split from Rose, West set his sights on his longtime friend and crush Kim Kardashian in early 2012. The pair were spotted out together and Kardashian’s famous family even started pressing the reality star for details on her new romance (remember when he let her borrow his car?!). Kanye West Raps About Wiz Khalifa, Amber Rose As West’s romance with Kardashian blossomed, so did that of his ex Rose and her new rapper fiancé, Wiz Khalifa. In April 2012, West released the song “Cold” in which he rapped, “Only n—a I got respect for is Wiz / And I’ll admit, I had fell in love with Kim around the same time she had fell in love with him.” Amber Rose Marries Wiz Khalifa After Welcoming Son Sebastian In February 2013, Rose and Khalifa had their first child, son Sebastian, announcing the news on Twitter. In July 2013, the couple secretly wed; the next month, they had a big ceremony in which Rose wore a stunning Pnina Tornai for Kleinfeld gown. She didn’t share photos from the private event until their one-year anniversary. North West Is Born Following a difficult pregnancy, Kim gave birth to her daughter, North West, in June 2013.

Rob Kardashian Skips the Wedding, Remains Under the Radar Things got awkward when Kim’s younger brother, Rob Kardashian, left Kim’s wedding festivities early. His exit followed months of erratic behavior: avoiding appearances on the family’s reality series, Keeping Up With the Kardashians, significant weight gain and depression. He’s stayed out of the public eye ever since. “He sent me a long email the morning of [saying] that he was going to leave,” Kim later said on Watch What Happens Live. “There was no fight.” Blac Chyna and Tyga Split In August 2014, the parents called it quits. “They are trying to keep it amicable,” ","The sentence is from the song ""Break My Heart"" by Hilary Duff, and the feuds mentioned are the well-publicized ones between the Kardashian-Jenner and West families, and Chyna, who was involved in a high-profile relationship with Rob Kardashian.

gossipcop-9639077061,1,0,"Ivanka Trump is becoming one of the most powerful first children in American History – despite not having an official job in the Trump administration. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) Ivanka Trump’s products weren’t always the hottest items online. In January, for instance, the first daughter’s fashion line ranked No. 550 based on the number of orders from Lyst, the biggest fashion e-commerce website in the world, according to Forbes. That changed dramatically the following month. Sales of Trump’s products skyrocketed in early February, making her Lyst’s 11th most popular brand. The biggest spike, according to Lyst, came on Feb. 9, when sales jumped by 219 percent from the day before. Yes, Feb. 9 — the same day that White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted Trump’s clothing and jewelry line on “Fox & Friends.” “Go buy Ivanka’s stuff is what I would tell you,” Conway said. “I’m going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody.” And viewers did, apparently. Sales of Ivanka Trump’s branded products skyrocketed on Feb. 9, the same day White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted the line on Fox News. (Lyst) Abigail Klem, president of the Ivanka Trump brand, said in a statement that “the beginning of February” shows “the best performing weeks in the history of the brand.” “For several different retailers, Ivanka Trump was a top performer online, and in some of the categories it was the best performance ever,” Klem said. Sarah Tanner, Lyst’s spokeswoman, said increases in sales are usually tied to current events. For instance, interest in pantsuits went up by 460 percent last year because of Hillary Clinton’s affinity for the style, she said. Sales of the first daughter’s products went up by 86 percent in November when her father won the presidential election, according to the company. Conway has come under fire for touting Ivanka Trump's clothing line during a televised interview. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) [A Trump wine boycott backfires spectacularly] But the brand was “largely featured” in the news in February, Tanner said. Conway gave her on-air endorsement of Ivanka Trump’s brand after President Trump had complained on Twitter that his daughter had “been treated so unfairly” by the department store Nordstrom, which dropped her clothing line over slow sales. “It would not be a surprise to us if it resulted in the increase in sales,” Tanner said of Conway’s Fox interview. “I think that’s one of the reasons the brand was largely in the news and could have attributed to this increase.” Conway did not respond to an email requesting comment.

In a remarkable turn of events, Ivanka Trump, daughter of the 45th President of the United States, Donald Trump, is emerging as one of the most powerful first children in American history – without holding an official job in the Trump administration.

Since her father's inauguration in January 2017, Ivanka Trump has been a key advisor to the President, playing a crucial role in shaping policy and representing the administration on various issues. From women's empowerment to workforce development, Ivanka has been a vocal advocate for issues that matter to women and working families.

Her influence in the White House has been well-documented, with many sources confirming her role as a ""shadow advisor"" to the President. Despite not holding an official position, Ivanka has been involved in high-level meetings with world leaders, including a recent gathering with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.

Ivanka's growing power and influence in the administration has not gone unnoticed. Critics have raised concerns about the potential for conflicts of interest, given her family's business ties and her own role as an advisor. However, supporters argue that her experience in the private sector and her passion for women's issues make her a valuable asset to the administration.

As Ivanka Trump continues to shape policy and represent the administration, it is clear that she is becoming one of the most powerful first children in American history – a testament to her determination and influence in the Trump White House."

Hollywood Responds to Trump's Decision to Pull Out of Paris Climate Accord

In a shocking move that has sent shockwaves across the globe, President Donald Trump announced on Thursday that he plans to pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord. The decision, which was met with widespread criticism and dismay, has prompted a swift response from Hollywood, with many celebrities and industry leaders speaking out against the president's decision.

""This is a devastating blow to our planet and our future,"" said actress and environmental activist, Emma Stone. ""I am heartbroken and outraged that our leader would put the interests of big oil and gas ahead of the well-being of our planet and its inhabitants.""

Stone was one of several celebrities who took to social media to express their disappointment and concern over the president's decision. Other notable celebrities, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Ruffalo, and Chris Hemsworth, also spoke out against the decision, calling it a ""betrayal"" of our planet and its people.

The film industry, which has long been at the forefront of environmental activism, was quick to condemn the president's decision. The Producers Guild of America, which represents many of the top film and television producers in the industry, released a statement expressing their ""deep disappointment"" in the president's decision.

""The Paris Agreement is a critical tool in the fight against climate change, and the United States' withdrawal from the accord is a major setback for our planet's future,"" said the guild's president, Gary Lucchesi. ""We urge the president to reconsider this decision and to work with the international community to address the pressing issue of climate change.""

The film industry's response to the president's decision is not surprising, given the industry's long-standing commitment to environmental activism. Many films and television shows have tackled the issue of climate change, and the industry has taken steps to reduce its own carbon footprint.

However, the president's decision has also sparked a broader debate about the role of the film industry in shaping public opinion and influencing policy. While some argue that the industry has a responsibility to use its platform to raise awareness about important issues like climate change, others argue that the industry should focus on entertaining and not try to influence politics.

Regardless of where one stands on the issue, it is clear that the president's decision to pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord has sparked a heated debate and a strong response from Hollywood and the film industry. As the world grapples with the implications of this decision, it is clear that the industry will continue to use its platform to raise awareness about the issue and push for action to address the pressing problem of climate change."

The news has sent shockwaves through Hollywood, with sources close to the couple revealing that they have been having trouble reconciling their differences and finding a way forward.

This is not the first time that the couple has faced challenges in their relationship. They were previously engaged in 2016 before calling off the wedding just a few months before the scheduled date. Since then, they have had several ups and downs, including a brief split in 2019. Despite their efforts to work through their issues, it seems that the couple has reached a point where they have decided to go their separate ways once again.

The decision to call off the engagement is a difficult one, and it is likely to have significant implications for both parties involved. The couple has been together for several years, and their relationship has been the subject of intense media scrutiny throughout that time. The breakdown of their engagement will no doubt be a topic of great interest to their fans and the public at large.

In a statement released earlier today, a representative for the couple confirmed that they have decided to go their separate ways. The statement read: ""After much consideration and thought, we have decided to go our separate ways. We appreciate the support and understanding of our fans and the public, and we ask for privacy at this time.""

The news of the couple's breakup has sent shockwaves through Hollywood, with many of their colleagues and friends expressing their sadness and disappointment at the news. The couple's split is a reminder that even the most seemingly solid relationships can be fragile and susceptible to the challenges and pressures of the outside world. As the couple moves forward, it is likely that they will face a difficult and emotional road ahead."

According to the rep, Johansson and Flay, who is known for his hit cooking shows and restaurants, simply enjoyed a friendly meal together and are not dating. The dinner was reportedly a casual affair, with the two stars laughing and chatting over a meal that included some of Flay's signature dishes.

While the rumor mill has been working overtime to suggest otherwise, it seems that Johansson and Flay are just friends and there is no romance brewing between them. The actress has been linked to several high-profile men in recent months, including her ""Avengers"" co-star Chris Evans, but it seems that she is not currently involved in any romantic relationships.

For his part, Flay has been married three times and has two daughters with his second wife, Stephanie March. He and March divorced in 2015 after 10 years of marriage.

New York, NY - In a surprise move, Broadway star Jennifer Holliday has withdrawn her participation as a performer at next week's presidential inaugural, citing a lack of understanding about the political implications of her involvement. In a statement released today, Holliday said that she did not realize that her performance would be interpreted as a statement of support for President-elect Donald Trump.

""I have always prided myself on being a performer who transcends politics and brings people together,"" Holliday said. ""However, I have come to realize that my participation in the inaugural would be misinterpreted as a show of support for the President-elect, and I do not wish to be a part of anything that could be divisive.""

Holliday, who is best known for her Tony-nominated performance in the musical ""Dreamgirls,"" was scheduled to perform at the inaugural ceremony next week. However, she has now withdrawn from the event, saying that she cannot in good conscience participate in an event that may be perceived as endorsing Trump.

The decision has sparked a heated debate, with some praising Holliday for her stance and others criticizing her for withdrawing from the event at the last minute. However, Holliday remains resolute in her decision, saying that she cannot ignore the potential consequences of her actions.

""I understand that my decision may be unpopular with some, but I cannot in good conscience contribute to an event that may be perceived as endorsing a candidate or administration that I do not support,"" Holliday said. ""I hope that my decision will be respected, and that we can all come together to celebrate the diversity and unity of our great nation.""

The withdrawal of Holliday from the inaugural ceremony is the latest in a series of high-profile defections from the event, which has been marked by controversy and protests. Other performers, including Elton John and Celine Dion, have also declined to participate in the event.

In a statement, the President-elect's inaugural committee expressed disappointment at Holliday's decision, saying that she was a ""talented performer"" who would have been a great addition to the event. However, the committee did not indicate any plans to replace Holliday with another performer.

The inaugural ceremony, which will take place on January 20, is expected to be a contentious event, with many protesters and activists planning to demonstrate against the President-elect's policies and actions. The event has already been marred by controversy, with several high-profile performers and speakers withdrawing from the event in recent days."

However the First Lady fears the active campaign to poison the president is “a high level operation” and “not the work of a solitary loon.”  Melania is popular in the White House—as she is with the rest of the country—and she has befriended senior intelligence agency staff who remain loyal to president. They have educated her about Ronald Regan’s poisoning by the Deep State after his assassination attempt in 1981. They have also warned her that George W. Bush was reduced to a “brain damaged” state after years of steady poisoning.  But the advantage Trump may hold over his GOP predecessors in the Oval Office is that he has a wife who is wise to the ruse and is insisting he watch his food and drink intake closely for signs of adulteration.  Donald Trump’s food choices say a lot about the man. The president’s Howard Hughes-level pickiness when it comes to food is partly motivated by a desire to avoid being poisoned, according to Melania. He doesn’t trust those around him – and rightfully so.  As President Trump knows all too well, there are enemies of the state dug in deep at the White House.  Reporters from TIME recently got a glimpse behind-the-scenes at the White House, where they reported on what goes down at the president’s dinner table. Of particular interest was a meal enjoyed by the reporters, Trump, and Vice President Pence.  Pence’s meal was not unusual—he ate what everyone else did. But the POTUS received a meal fully customized to his own preferences, and closely observed by Melania who insisted on watching the chef prepare the meal with ingredients she provided herself.","First Lady Melania Trump has made a shocking claim that there is a secret poisoner in the White House who is slowly poisoning her husband, President Donald Trump, with ""heavy sedatives"" smuggled into his drinks. According to reports, Mrs. Trump believes that the poisoning is an attempt to slow down her husband, control him, and discredit his presidency.

The First Lady's allegations have sent shockwaves throughout the White House and the nation, with many people expressing concern and outrage over the alleged plot. The President's health and well-being have been a subject of speculation for months, with some critics accusing him of being in cognitive decline.

However, the White House has dismissed Mrs. Trump's claims as ""baseless and ridiculous,"" saying that the President is in good health and that there is no evidence to support the First Lady's allegations. The President's physician, Dr. Ronny Jackson, has also released a statement saying that the President is in excellent physical and mental health.

Despite the denials, many people are taking Mrs. Trump's claims seriously, with some calling for an investigation into the matter. The alleged poisoning plot has raised questions about the safety of the President and the security of the White House, and some are expressing concern about the potential consequences of such an act.

The situation is still developing, and it remains to be seen how the allegations will be addressed and what the outcome will be. In the meantime, the nation is holding its breath, hoping that the President and the First Lady will be able to resolve the issue and ensure the safety of the President and the security of the White House."

The action star has steadily starred in film after film, yet has been at the center of several dating rumors.  As the International Business Times reports, “The actor was mistakenly linked to an Australian journalist and then was associated to his Mission: Impossible 6 co-star and Crown actress Vanessa Kirby.”  All rumors until now have been stamped out as false.  However, the latest claims include those stating that members of the Church of Scientology have once again been playing matchmaker for the Top Gun star and that Cruise has reportedly been secretly dating over the past little while. Interestingly enough, Tom has reportedly been using a disguise to enjoy dates with the ladies, much like Katie Holmes did in the initial stages of her romance with Jamie Foxx.  A source told the publication about Cruise’s tactics to keep his love life out of the spotlight.  “Tom’s back on the dating scene, but nobody knows it’s him. His face is way too recognizable for him to stroll into the bars, so he has his makeup artist create a silicone mask. Seems like Tom took his Mission: Impossible role to heart. It’s just what Ethan Hunt would do in the movies.”  It’s also been claimed that the disguise, which includes makeup, takes a full five hours to apply. If this rumor all sounds a little far-fetched, that’s because it is completely untrue, according to Gossip Cop. Tom Cruise does not go through some elaborate process to secretly step out on dates. In fact, there has not been any confirmation that Tom Cruise has dated anyone since Katie Holmes.  Alberto E. Rodriguez / Getty Images  Katie Holmes, however, continues to attempt to keep her romance with Jamie Foxx a secret, despite the fact that the pair has been spotted on numerous occasions over the past year on beach getaways and romantic locales like Paris.

""If they chose to pursue a relationship while they were still married, that is their business and no one else's.""

The allegations have also raised questions about the status of Affleck's and Shookus' respective divorces. Sources close to the situation say that both Affleck and Shookus have already filed for divorce, but the proceedings have not yet been finalized.

The scandal has already had far-reaching consequences, with Affleck's upcoming film, ""The Batman,"" facing uncertainty as a result of the allegations. The film's production company, Warner Bros., has yet to comment on the situation, but insiders say that the scandal could potentially impact the film's release date and marketing campaign.

For now, the fate of Affleck and Shookus' relationship remains uncertain, as does the fallout from the allegations. One thing is clear, however: this scandal has sent shockwaves through Hollywood and will undoubtedly be a topic of discussion for weeks to come."

A new report claims now that they’re both single, ‘the door is open’ for them to take things to the next level.  Is there a new celebrity romance brewing? A new report from OK! is claiming that things might start heating up between Robert Pattinson, 32, and Sienna Miller, 36. The two actors “have been close for years,” an insider tells the magazine, adding that “they’ve always had a great connection, but one of them was always with someone else, so it stayed platonic.” However, both of them aren’t currently seeing anyone now. “Now that they’re both single, the door is open for them to give this a real shot,” the source continued.  As for the pair’s friends, they reportedly think that these two would work really well together. “All of their mutual friends think Rob and Sienna would be a good match,” the insider said. Rob and Sienna have always seemed pretty close. While promoting their film, The Lost City Of Z at the Berlin International Film Festival in Feb. 2017, the pair looked comfortable together while posing for photos and grabbing dinner together.  This would definitely be an interesting match though considering Sienna is the one who set the Twilight star up with his ex-fiancée FKA twigs. A source told E!

According to sources, the intimate gathering was attended by a select group of A-list celebrities, including Meryl Streep, George Clooney, and Julia Roberts, all of whom were dressed to the nines for the exclusive soiree.

The dinner party marked the first public outing for Hiddleston and Elba since they were rumored to have begun dating earlier this year. The two actors have yet to confirm the speculation, but their cozy appearance at Wintour's home has only fueled the rumor mill.

As for Wintour, the fashion icon has long been known for her impeccable taste and her ability to bring together some of the biggest names in entertainment and fashion.

With the summer blockbuster season fast approaching, it's clear that the stars are already starting to align for what promises to be a thrilling and action-packed season at the movies.

gossipcop-7885025406,1,0,"More than a month has passed since Matt Lauer was fired from the Today show, and his former longtime colleague, Katie Couric, is now opening up about the former NBC anchor’s shocking dismissal.  “The whole thing has been very painful for me,” Couric, 61, tells PEOPLE. “The accounts I’ve read and heard have been disturbing, distressing and disorienting and it’s completely unacceptable that any woman at the Today show experienced this kind of treatment.  “I had no idea this was going on during my tenure or after I left,” she continued. “I think I speak for many of my former colleagues when I say this was not the Matt we knew. Matt was a kind and generous colleague who treated me with respect. In fact, a joke I once made on late-night television was just that, because it was completely contrary to our brother-sister relationship. It’s still very upsetting. I really admire the way Savannah [Guthrie] and Hoda [Kotb] and the entire Today show staff have handled a very difficult situation.”  The late-night show joke that Couric refers to is when she said on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen in 2012 that Lauer “pinches me on the ass a lot.” A clip of the comment made the rounds online in the wake of Lauer’s firing.  Couric spent 15 years co-hosting NBC’s Today show with Lauer, 60, but left in May 2006 to anchor the CBS Evening News.  NBC/Getty  Lauer was fired at the end of November by NBC News after the network received a “detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior,” with reason to believe “this may not have been an isolated incident.” Women have also anonymously accused him of sexual harassment and assault in reports published by Variety and The New York Times.  Following his firing, which was announced live on Today by Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb, Lauer addressed the original allegations in a statement.  “There are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions,” he said, in part. “To the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry. As I am writing this, I realize the depth of the damage and disappointment I have left behind at home and at NBC.”  Although her PEOPLE interview is the first time Couric has spoken in detail about Lauer’s exit, she briefly broke her silence about the scandal on social media in December.  In a short response to an Instagram user, who called Couric out for not publicly addressing the scandal, the veteran journalist said, “It’s incredibly upsetting and I will say something when I’m ready to. Thanks for your interest.”  RELATED VIDEO: Women of Hollywood Attend Golden Globes Together in Support of the Time’s Up Movement  The claims against Lauer came as hundreds of women and men — including Rose McGowan, Ashley Judd, Terry Crews and Anthony Rapp — have publicly came forward about alleged sexual misconduct at the hands of powerful men in Hollywood, including Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey.  The movement inspired the new Time’s Up initiative and legal defense fund that was created to help victims of sexual misconduct pursue legal action against their perpetrators. Time’s Up was a major focus at this year’s Golden Globes, where almost all the famous attendees wore black to raise awareness about the cause.  “I think it was really moving to see so many women support each other and demand change, not only for themselves, but for mistreated and marginalized women in all kinds of industries,” Couric tells PEOPLE about Time’s Up. “Clearly we are witnessing a sea change and a long overdue course correction.”  She also said that one of the new of the episodes of her upcoming six-part documentary Nat Geo series will focus on harassment women have experienced in their workplaces.  “One of my Nat Geo episodes explores the various obstacles that are holding women back in Hollywood, Silicon Valley and beyond,” she says. “I just interviewed Elisabeth Moss about this. Harassment is just one part of the equation.”  RELATED VIDEO: Hoda Kotb and ","More than a month has passed since Matt Lauer was fired from the Today show, and his former longtime colleague, Katie Couric, is now opening up about the former NBC anchor’s shocking dismissal.

In an exclusive interview with The New York Times, Couric, who worked alongside Lauer for more than a decade, revealed that she was ""shocked and saddened"" by his termination.

""I had no idea this was coming,"" Couric said, her voice trembling as she recounted the events leading up to Lauer's dismissal. ""I was as surprised as anyone.""

According to Couric, Lauer's behavior had changed in the months leading up to his firing, but she did not specify what those changes were.

""I don't think anyone saw this coming,"" Couric said. ""I don't think Matt did either.""

Lauer was fired from the Today show on November 29 after NBC received a detailed complaint about his inappropriate behavior with a colleague. An investigation was launched, and Lauer was subsequently fired.

Couric, who has been a vocal advocate for women's rights and sexual harassment awareness, said that she believes the allegations against Lauer are ""serious and disturbing.""

""I think it's important for all of us to take a step back and think about the culture we're living in,"" Couric said. ""We need to create a workplace where everyone feels safe and respected.""

Couric's comments come as NBC is facing increased scrutiny over its handling of the Lauer allegations. Some have criticized the network for not taking action sooner, while others have praised NBC for taking swift and decisive action.

In a statement, an NBC spokesperson said, ""We take all allegations of inappropriate behavior seriously and will continue to do so. We are committed to creating a safe and respectful workplace for all of our employees.""

Lauer has not publicly commented on the allegations against him. His lawyer, Nancy Erika Smith, has called the allegations ""unfounded"" and ""inaccurate.""

The scandal has sent shockwaves through the media industry, with many calling for greater accountability and transparency in the workplace.

As the investigation into Lauer's behavior continues, one thing is clear: the world of morning television will never be the same."

The Russian told BBC World Service Sport he did not think McEnroe was ""trying to talk women's tennis down"" but said ""the reality"" was that ""men are stronger in general"".  ""I would hope that I would win against Serena,"" he added.  ""It would be a similar argument to: who would run faster, the fastest woman or the fastest man? Tennis is becoming more and more a physical sport, so it's going to be hard for a woman to beat the men.  ""It's not black and white, there are lots of factors to take into account. Physically I might not be in the best shape of my life but as an overall package I'm much better than my ranking would suggest. She is pregnant, and I'm not.  ""I've never heard John say anything absolutely stupid - he knows his stuff. What he said about her being an incredible player is correct - explosive, powerful and she puts in a lot of work. But I would hope that I would win.""  Battle of the sexes  A crowd of 30,000 watched Billie Jean King take on Bobby Riggs in Houston in 1973  Tennis matches between men and women have occurred before, mostly notably back in 1973 when Billie Jean King took on fellow American Bobby Riggs.  Riggs, the world number one in the 1940s, retired in 1951 and at the age of 55 believed he could beat any of the top female players.  King originally declined to play Riggs and Australian Margaret Court - at the time the top female player in the world - stepped in. Riggs won 6-2 6-1.  But later that year, the top ranked women's player King - 26 years younger than Riggs at 29 - took him on in an exhibition match at the Houston Astrodome and won 6-4 6-3 6-3.  A third 'Battle of the Sexes' match took in 1992 between American former world number one Jimmy Connors, aged 40 at the time, and Czech and American Martina Navratilova, who was 35.  The match took place under special rules to make it more competitive - Connors was allowed only one serve per point, and Navratilova was allowed to hit into half the doubles court. Connors won 7-5 6-2.","The 23-time Grand Slam champion has fired back at the seven-time major winner after he said that she would be ranked outside the top 700 players if she played on the men's circuit. ""I would hope that I would win against Serena,"" McEnroe told BBC Sport. ""I think she's a great player, but if she had to compete against the top men, she'd be like 700th in the world."" However, Williams is not impressed with McEnroe's statement, saying that she is a better player than he thinks. ""I would hope that I would win against John, as well,"" Williams said. ""I don't think he's a great player. He's a good player, but he's not on my level."" Williams has won 23 Grand Slam titles, including four in a row at Wimbledon from 2015 to 2018. She is widely regarded as one of the greatest female tennis players of all time, and her victory over Simona Halep at Wimbledon last year was her 24th Grand Slam title. McEnroe, on the other hand, has won seven Grand Slam titles, including four at Wimbledon. Despite his success, McEnroe has been criticized for his controversial statements in the past, and his latest remarks about Williams have sparked outrage among tennis fans. ""It's not the first time John has made controversial statements, and it's not going to be the last,"" Williams said. ""I just hope that he can learn to respect women's tennis and understand that we are just as talented as the men."" Williams's comments come as she prepares to defend her US Open title later this month. She is currently ranked number one in the world and is the favorite to win the tournament. McEnroe, meanwhile, is not competing in the US Open, but he will be in attendance to watch his daughter, Petra, compete in the women's singles."

Brothers, James Stanford Poore, 32, and Cedric Dwayne Poore, 39, were arrested and booked on four complaints each of first degree murder, Chief Chuck Jordan said.  On Monday, January 7, 2013, twin sisters Rebeika Powell and Kayetie Powell-Melchor, 23; Misty Nunley, 33, and Julie Jackson, 55 were found shot in the head, with their hands tied behind their backs inside a south Tulsa apartment, police say. A 3-year-old boy was also found inside the apartment, unharmed.  Chief Jordan said the murders were not gang-related. According to arrest reports, witnesses told investigators that the brothers left an apartment in the same building at Fairmont Terrace Apartments, near 61st and Peoria, saying they were going to pull a ""lick"" at the victims' apartment.  Witnesses told police the brothers returned about 20 minutes later with a bag full of drugs, cash, and jewelry. According to the report, James Poore told the witnesses that he shot one of the victims because she could identify him and that Cedric shot the other three. The witnesses told investigators the brothers split the money and that Cedric Poore took the jewelry to pawn.    When he was interviewed Wednesday, James Poore confirmed to investigators that he knew one of the victims and that he was in the apartment where the witnesses placed him. Before invoking his right to remain silent, he told investigators he knew one of the victims had used and sold illegal drugs and that Cedric drove a black van to the apartment the day of the murders.    The arrest report shows Cedric Poore denied being in the apartment the day of the murders and refused to speak to investigators any more.  Chief Jordan said the brothers both stayed at Fairmont Terrace Apartments. The property manager there told News On 6 that neither of them are on a lease.  Cedric Poore has been in Tulsa County jail on a traffic violation since January 14, and James Poore was arrested Wednesday morning. Department of Corrections records show both James and Cedric have been previously convicted and incarcerated for robbery with a firearm.  Chief Jordan said more arrests may still be made.

Emotional Storylines on Keeping Up With The Kardashians Defy Preconceptions

For the past decade, Keeping Up With The Kardashians has been a staple of popular culture, known for its over-the-top glamour, catty banter, and relentless self-promotion. But look beyond the surface-level drama and you'll find some genuinely emotional storylines that defy preconceptions about the show and its stars.

In recent episodes, viewers have witnessed Kourtney Kardashian struggle with the decision to have a third child via surrogacy, Kim Kardashian West face the aftermath of her traumatic Paris robbery, and Khloe Kardashian navigate the challenges of co-parenting with her ex-husband Lamar Odom. These storylines are not just tabloid fodder, but deeply personal and emotional journeys that reveal the vulnerable side of the Kardashian clan.

Despite the show's reputation for superficiality, the Kardashians have always been open about their personal struggles and triumphs. From Kim's high-profile marriage and divorce from Kris Humphries, to Khloe's public battle with her weight and body image, the family has never shied away from sharing their most intimate moments with the world.

But it's not just the Kardashian sisters who are driving the emotional storylines this season. In a recent episode, Kris Jenner, the family matriarch and self-proclaimed ""momager,"" revealed her own struggles with aging and the pressure to maintain her youthful image. The scene was a poignant reminder that even the most glamorous and powerful people in the world face their own insecurities and fears.

The show's ability to balance lighthearted humor and serious emotional depth is a testament to the Kardashians' resilience and adaptability. Despite the constant scrutiny and criticism, they continue to open up their lives to the world, sharing their joys and sorrows with a devoted fan base.

So, if you're one of the many viewers who has written off Keeping Up With The Kardashians as shallow and vapid, think again. There's more to the show than meets the eye, and the emotional storylines this season are not to be missed."

Donald Trump will be sworn in as the 45th president of the United States on Friday, but not everyone will be tuning in. Despite the historical significance of the moment, many Americans have expressed their intent to boycott the inauguration, citing concerns over the president-elect's divisive rhetoric and controversial policies.

According to a recent survey, more than half of all Americans plan to avoid watching the inauguration, with many stating that they do not support Trump's presidency and do not want to legitimize it. This boycott is not limited to liberals and Democrats, as some conservatives and Republicans have also expressed their intention to skip the event.

The reasons for the boycott are varied, but many critics point to Trump's inflammatory language and actions as the main reasons for their decision. During his campaign, Trump was criticized for his comments on immigrants, women, and minority groups, and his policies have been met with opposition from both sides of the aisle.

Despite the boycott, the inauguration is expected to draw a large crowd, with many Americans eager to witness the historic moment and see the country's democratic process in action. However, the boycott highlights the deep divisions within the country and the challenges that Trump will face as he takes office.

As the country prepares to welcome its new leader, the inauguration will be a testament to the strength and resilience of American democracy, even in the face of controversy and division. However, for those who choose to boycott the event, it is a powerful statement of their dissent and a call for change."

You can wait for your own fans to descend upon this poor individual and shred him from tweet to tweet.  Or, you can be splendidly disarming.  This last path was the one taken by Kardashian.

So she brought him onto her side with something so blessedly charming that it not only made her seem entirely self-aware -- rather than merely self-absorbed -- but also must have enticed a chuckle from Kevin James himself.  Indeed, it incited James to respond with quite considered contrition.  @KimKardashian Listen: altho my tweet came across ""seemingly"" disrespectful, it was just a thought/tweet worthy reaction.. lol...

We'd all love to have that skill.  On truly good days, we find it.

The country superstar opened up about his romance with the No Doubt frontwoman in a new interview with Billboard magazine.  As previously reported, Shelton told Stefani that he was splitting from Lambert during a meeting with their Voice coworkers. The “Misery” singer, who was new to the team at the time, got emotional.  “I won’t forget that day. I looked over at Gwen — who I didn’t really know — and she had these huge tears in her eyes. I thought, ‘Wow, she feels super bad for me!’” Shelton recalled. “She didn’t tell me much, because we didn’t know each other at the time, but she said, ‘I’m going through something very similar to what you’re going through. I understand. And I hate it.’”  Stefani was dealing with her own breakup at the time with Gavin Rossdale. (As Us Weekly exclusively revealed, the Bush rocker was cheating on her with their children’s nanny, Mindy Mann.) They announced they were ending their 13-year marriage in August 2015, one month after Shelton and Lambert announced they were divorcing after four years.  The “Came Here to Forget” singer and Stefani leaned on each other for support during the difficult time. The closer they got, the more Shelton saw Stefani in a new light.  “That’s kind of how our friendship and bond started, that day. It went from that, to checking in on each other once a week through email — ‘This s–t happened to me, what happened to you?’ — to maybe three times a week, then every day, to ‘Hey, here’s my phone number if you ever want to text,’” Shelton told Billboard. “Next thing I know, I wake up and she’s all I care about, and I’m ­wondering if she feels the same about me.”  “Gwen saved my life,” he added. “Who else on earth could understand going through a high-profile divorce from another musician? You can’t even imagine the similarities in our divorces.”  The two teamed up professionally too. Shelton included their collaborative track, “Go Ahead and Break My Heart,” on his 12th studio album, If I’m Honest.  “When we recorded the vocals for some of these songs, I was only six months removed from when all the crap went down,” Shelton said of his split from Lambert. “When you have a broken heart — at least, when I do — you got to get it out of your system. You want people to sympathize with you.

Country music superstar Blake Shelton has opened up about the painful aftermath of his divorce from Miranda Lambert, revealing that it was his current girlfriend, Gwen Stefani, who helped him find his footing again.

In an exclusive interview with a leading entertainment magazine, Shelton shared that the breakdown of his marriage to Lambert, which was announced in July 2015, left him feeling ""broken and lost.""

""I was in a dark place, and I didn't know how to get out of it,"" Shelton admitted. ""But then Gwen came along, and she was like a ray of sunshine in my life. She helped me see that there was more to life than just pain and heartache.""

Shelton credited Stefani, a singer and actress who he started dating in 2015, with giving him the strength and support he needed to heal and move on from his divorce.

""Gwen was always there for me, no matter what,"" Shelton said. ""She listened to me when I needed someone to talk to, and she helped me find my sense of humor again. She was my sweet escape from all the negativity and hurt.""

The couple, who have been dating for over three years, have been spotted together at various events and outings, and their relationship has been the subject of much speculation and media attention.

However, Shelton insisted that their relationship is not just a fleeting romance, but a genuine and meaningful connection that has helped him find happiness and fulfillment once again.

""Gwen is more than just a girlfriend to me,"" Shelton said. ""She's my best friend, my confidante, and my partner in every sense of the word. She's the reason I'm smiling again, and I'll always be grateful to her for that.""

Shelton's comments come amidst speculation that he and Stefani may be planning to tie the knot in the near future. While the couple has not yet confirmed any wedding plans, their love and commitment to each other is clear for all to see.

Her career began in the world of fashion before moving into journalism, largely at the behest of her parents. In the year 1970, Wintour was hired on as an editorial assistant for the new Harper's & Queen fashion magazine. Even at this early stage of her career, Wintour divulged to coworkers that she had the desire to edit Vogue, a desire that would grow to be fulfilled nearly 20 years later. Wintour introduced sweeping changes to Vogue from her first issue forward. Many of these changes could be seen right on the cover. Wintour favored more naturalistic photography of lesser-known models outside, as opposed to the tight headshots the magazine had previously favored. Additionally, Wintour's first Vogue cover was also the first to feature a model wearing jeans, with the added bonus of wearing a bejeweled T-shirt valued at around $10,000. Under Wintour, Vogue has continued to be one of the pillars of fashion journalism.","Title: Anna Wintour's Net Worth Reaches $35 Million, Cementing Her Position as a Fashion Industry Powerhouse

The professional dancer, who has been a staple on the show for over a decade, left audiences and his partner Vanessa Lachey reeling when he failed to show up for a performance.

The pair had been working together since the beginning of the season, and their chemistry on the dance floor had been one of the highlights of the show.

Twitter has been abuzz with reactions to the news, with many fans expressing their disappointment and shock at Chmerkovskiy's sudden exit. Some have even called for his return to the show, while others have defended his decision to leave.

Amidst new rumors that Blake is having trouble in his relationship with Gwen Stefani, 47, an insider tells InTouch that Miranda wants to confront her ex to finally get closure. “It needs to be done,” the source tells the mag. “There’s still a lot of unfinished business between [Miranda] and Blake. She needs to look straight into Blake’s eyes, ask certain questions, and get answers.”  There are no plans set for this meeting to actually take place just yet, but the mag claims that if it does happen, Miranda plans to go in with a “clear head,” although that might not be so easy. “This could get heated,” the insider admits. “As soon as the emotions come up, [Miranda] may lose it.” This doesn’t mean the 33-year-old wants to get back together with her ex, though — actually, it’s just the opposite. She’s very happy with her man, Anderson East, 29, but feels a face-to-face with Blake is what she needs to fully be ready to commit to another relationship, according to the source.  “She feels that [she and Blake] have both grown so much since their divorce that meeting up is essential for them to have healthy relationships in the future,” InTouch’s insider says. “Who knows, maybe this meeting with Blake will have them walk away as friends.

The National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) has leveled a scathing accusation against NBC, charging the network with ""whitewashing"" after the recent announcement that Tamron Hall is leaving the network. In a statement released today, NABJ president Sarah Glover expressed outrage over the fact that Hall, who is black, will be replaced by a white anchor, saying that ""the dismissal of Tamron Hall is just the latest example of the erasure of black voices and perspectives from the media landscape.""

Hall, who has been a fixture on NBC for over a decade, announced last week that she would be leaving the network to host her own daily show on ABC. But according to NABJ, NBC's decision to replace her with a white anchor ""undermines the progress that has been made towards greater diversity and inclusion in the media.""

The organization is calling on NBC to take immediate action to address the issue, including hiring more black journalists and providing opportunities for advancement within the network. ""The loss of Tamron Hall is a loss for the entire media industry, and it's a reminder that there is still much work to be done to ensure that black voices are represented and valued in the media,"" Glover said.

NBC has not yet responded to NABJ's accusations, but the network has faced criticism in the past for its lack of diversity. In 2016, the network was criticized for its all-white lineup of hosts at the Golden Globes, and in 2018, it was accused of ""whitening"" the cast of its popular show ""The Voice.""

The controversy comes at a time when diversity and inclusion are top of mind for many in the media industry. In recent years, there has been a growing push for more representation and opportunities for underrepresented groups in the media, and several major media outlets have made public commitments to increasing diversity and inclusion.

But despite these efforts, the NABJ's accusations against NBC suggest that there is still much work to be done to ensure that black voices and perspectives are represented and valued in the media. As the industry continues to grapple with issues of diversity and inclusion, the NABJ's statement serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of representation and the need for greater action to address the issue."
gossipcop-5658990975,1,0,"Daniel Craig is returning as James Bond once again, even as he reportedly fights to save his marriage to Rachel Weisz at the same time. Craig has already announced his intent to return as 007 in the franchise’s 25th film, and according to the National Enquirer, he’s still struggling to salvage what’s left of his marriage.  The Enquirer’s source claimed at the beginning of 2017, “Rachel and Daniel haven’t been happy for a while, and nearly called it quits last year.” The report claims that the married couple was in two separate filming locations at the beginning of the year, but continued to stay apart even after wrapping their respective films. The Enquirer then claims that they finally reunited in July after not being seen together in ‘554 days’.  According to the sources, the minute the outlet attempted to lock down an exclusive on the couple’s rocky marriage, both Rachel Weisz and Daniel Craig were seen arriving at New York’s Public Theater the next day, prompting the source to add, “The whole thing just seemed like too much of a coincidence. I don’t buy it for a minute.”  When you consider Daniel Craig’s own words, especially in the context of allegedly turning down a $150 million payday to star in two more James Bond films, he had stated, “Being on your own would be sad, sick, and weird. I don’t trust myself. I need that balance.” If these reports are to be believed, then Daniel Craig previously turned down starring in more Bond films to spend time with his family, but now – all of a sudden – he’s back to working on James Bond?  Either the report was never accurate to begin with, or he’s giving up on his marriage to Rachel Weisz. One would hope that the two have worked out whatever was troubling them in the first place, but given their own relationship and marriage histories – and how they’ve both jumped ship on long-term relationships at the drop of a hat – one wouldn’t be faulted for assuming that they are on their way to getting a divorce.  What do you guys think? Are Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz having marriage troubles, and is Daniel’s decision to take on the role of 007 again an indication that he’s giving up on his marriage? Or just a chance to have more career stability and/or cash in on a major paycheck? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.

gossipcop-4774142356,1,1,"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired. T","Poor Katie Holmes!

The situation has allegedly become so tense that Holmes has sought legal advice to protect herself and her daughter, and has even considered taking Suri to live with her in New York City. However, sources close to the family have denied these reports, saying that Holmes and Cruise are simply working together to provide the best possible upbringing for their daughter.

Meanwhile, Holmes’ relationship with boyfriend Jamie Foxx has also been the subject of intense media scrutiny. Despite reports of a rocky romance, sources claim that the two are still going strong and are even planning a secret vacation together.

Childhood pal Ninaki Priddy opened up about Prince Harry's fiancée, claiming her desire to be famous outweighed her commitment to her marriage to film producer Trevor Engelson.  Meghan married her ex back in 2011 on a Jamaican beach. They split two years later after she landed her role in Suits, which filmed in Toronto. Previously it was thought the pair grew apart after Meghan spent months filming in Canada and her beau was based in LA.  Ninaki says otherwise.  (Image: Getty Images North America)  (Image: REX/Shutterstock)  ""The way she handled it, Trevor definitely had the rug pulled out from under him. He was hurt,"" she said, explaining that while Trevor was heartbroken, Meghan was less affected,"" she told Mail Online.  Prior to their split, Ninaki - who was maid of honour at the wedding - said the pair doted on each other and Trevor would have done anything for the actress.  ""Then, after the wedding, it was like a light switched off. There’s Meghan before fame and Meghan after fame. After three seasons of Suits, she called me to say the marriage was over.  The pair first met aged two at Hollywood’s private Little Red School House before they went to the Immaculate Heart girls’ high school in Los Angeles at the age of 11.  Following a close friendship that she describes as 'sisterly', Ninaki says the pair eventually fell out over how Meghan and ex-husband - who the ex Suits star met when she was just 23 - split.  She explains she went to visit Trevor who was heartbroken over their split, while Meghan seemed less affected.

""I think it’s a very fanciful dream to believe that you just walk into a Prince Charming.  ""I know the Royal Family was something she found fascinating. She had one of Princess Diana’s books [Diana: Her True Story] on her bookshelf, and even when she was with Trevor she told me she wanted to go and stay in London for at least a month.""

In an interview with US Weekly, Jessica said: ""Meghan was struggling with her career. She wanted to be an actress, but it wasn't happening for her.

The video would soon catch the eye of Premier League soccer player David Beckham, who immediately picked out the brunette Spice Girl in her black PVC catsuit and matching gloves.  He declared: “That’s the girl for me and I'm going to get her! She's my idea of perfection. I knew that if she wanted me, we would be together forever.”  They later met at a Manchester United soccer players’ lounge, where it was love at first sight—although Victoria later admitted she was a little tipsy at the time.  The couple married in 1999 and had four children; sons Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz, and Harper. The pair have also forged a successful brand over their almost 20-year marriage, with Victoria starting a successful fashion label after attempting a less-than-stellar solo music career.

gossipcop-1551062653,1,0,"  George Clooney and his wife, Amal, attend the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. (Alberto Pizzoli/AFP via Getty Images)  Once the ultimate bachelor — and two-time People’s Sexiest Man Alive cover model — George Clooney entered entirely new territory this week.  The Oscar-winning actor and his human-rights-lawyer wife of two years, Amal, announced Tuesday that they are the proud new parents of twins, Ella and Alexander.  Clooney has donned many hats in his life — actor, director, producer and activist, but fatherhood had always seemed far away. Was it the early-onset-salt-and-pepper hair? The coterie of models who found themselves on his arm for fleeting moments over the years? The insistence by tabloids and fellow co-stars that it was time for him to settle down? Maybe. Or perhaps it was the simple fact that Clooney himself said again and again that he would not reproduce. In several interviews. Many, many times. For many, many years.  A first-time father at 56, Clooney was often asked throughout his career whether the single life was his ultimate future. But after proposing marriage to Amal in April 2014 and marrying her that September (as well as sharing wedding photos with People magazine in the United States and Hello magazine in Britain), it seemed as if anything was possible for the man who once said, “I don’t see myself ever having kids.”  But it was a long road to get there. “I don’t have that gene that people have to replicate,” he told People in 2006.  When Esquire asked him why he wasn’t married with kids, he replied, “I haven’t had aspirations in that way, ever.” And as for people who thought it was weird that a man in his 50s was single and childless? “What do you do? Should I go, ‘I got to get me some kids right now!’ and rush out and impregnate someone?”  Clooney seemed to express frustration when asked how he could ever relate to the fathers he occasionally portrays onscreen. His answer: “Well, I’m also not running for president, but I played that role in ‘Ides of March.’ I wasn’t an actual lawyer when I did ‘Michael Clayton,’ and I don’t fire people for a living like I did in ‘Up in the Air.’ ”  “I keep saying I’ll never get married again or have children but people just don’t want to believe me,” Clooney told Britain’s Daily Express just three months before popping the question to his now-wife.  Of course, celebrities are people, too, and it shouldn’t surprise anyone that a man might change his mind around the midcentury mark. And Clooney is certainly not alone in choosing to wait till later in life to welcome a child into the family: Comedian Steve Martin became a father at age 67 in 2012; Elton John was 63 when he had a baby via a surrogate in 2010; and Chris Noth was 53 when he welcomed his only child in 2008.  Perhaps it’s the fact that Clooney always seemed so delightfully and devilishly Clooney-ish that made his bachelordom seem like the only constant in our ever-changing popular culture. But we can rest easy knowing that despite some hesitation about having a family over the years, his sense of humor has remained steady throughout.  “Ella, Alexander and Amal are all healthy, happy and doing fine,” the statement announcing the birth of the twins read. “George is sedated and should recover in a few days.”","With his wife, Amal, by his side, the actor-director-producer attended the 2016 Cannes Film Festival, where he premiered his new film, Money Monster."

Breaking News: ABC Cancels Roseanne After Racist Tweet

In a shocking turn of events, ABC has canceled the popular sitcom Roseanne after its star, Roseanne Barr, sent a racist tweet comparing Valerie Jarrett, former advisor to President Barack Obama, to an ape. The cancellation comes just hours after Barr posted the offensive tweet, which has sparked widespread outrage and condemnation from celebrities, politicians, and civil rights organizations.

The tweet, which was posted early Tuesday morning, read: ""Muslim Brotherhood & Planet of the Apes had a baby = VJ."" The tweet was quickly met with backlash, with many calling for the show to be canceled. ABC has since released a statement, saying: ""Roseanne's Twitter statement is abhorrent, repugnant, and inconsistent with our values."" The network has decided to cancel the show, effective immediately.

This is not the first time that Barr has made controversial statements on social media. In the past, she has been criticized for her support of President Trump and her outspoken views on politics. However, this latest tweet has crossed a line, and ABC has made the decision to distance itself from the show and its star.

The cancellation of Roseanne is a significant blow to the show's cast and crew, who had been gearing up for a second season. The show was a ratings success and had been praised for its portrayal of working-class life in America. However, the network has made it clear that it will not tolerate racist behavior, and the cancellation of the show is a testament to that commitment.

The news has sent shockwaves through the entertainment industry, with many celebrities and industry leaders speaking out against Barr's tweet. ""Roseanne's tweet is a reminder that words have power, and that racism has no place in our society,"" said actress and activist, Viola Davis. ""I applaud ABC for taking a stand against hate speech.""

The cancellation of Roseanne is a significant moment in the ongoing debate about racism and free speech in America. It is a reminder that words have consequences, and that the entertainment industry has a responsibility to promote inclusivity and respect for all people."

With lyrics about empowerment and ridding one's self of negativity, Swift is once again being lauded as a feminist for a younger generation.  ""It's interesting how feminism has come up in conversation so much more in the last year,"" Swift said. ""I was never really taught the definition of feminism when I was a little girl and I wish I had been.""

REP. DEVIN NUNES: The big felony in all of this that nobody talks about from the very beginning was the leak of highly classified information when they leaked the phone call of the Russian ambassador talking to General Mike Flynn right before the inauguration. That was a felony, nothing’s ever been done about it.    BARTIROMO: Is your office investigating this sir?    SESSIONS: That is a violation of the law, to leak classified documents and it is being investigated. I will say this, the last two years before I became Attorney General there were each year there were three open investigations of classified leaks now we have 27 we’re going after this aggressively. I am directing it personally, some of the matters involve this matter and some of it is a matter I am not recused on and we’re pursuing it aggressively.","Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Sunday vowed to aggressively investigate the leak of a phone call between former national security advisor General Mike Flynn and the Russian ambassador, asserting that the disclosure of classified information is a ""criminal act.""

In an interview with FOX News Channel's Sunday Morning Futures, hosted by Maria Bartiromo, Sessions stated, ""We are aggressively investigating the leak of this transcript to the public, and we will continue to do so until we reach the bottom of this. It is a criminal act to disclose classified information, and we will not tolerate it.""

Sessions' comments come as the Department of Justice (DOJ) is facing intense scrutiny over the handling of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The Attorney General has faced criticism from both Republicans and Democrats over his recusal from the probe, as well as his alleged involvement in the firing of former FBI Director James Comey.

However, Sessions maintained that the DOJ is ""doing its job"" in investigating the Flynn-Russian ambassador call leak, and emphasized that the department will ""follow the facts wherever they may lead.""

""We will not let political considerations or personal biases interfere with our duty to uphold the law and protect the American people,"" Sessions said. ""We will continue to work tirelessly to uncover the truth and ensure that those responsible for the leak are held accountable.""

The investigation into the Flynn-Russian ambassador call leak is just one of several probes currently being conducted by the DOJ into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The department is also investigating potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials, as well as allegations of obstruction of justice by the President.

Sessions' comments on Sunday suggest that the DOJ is taking the leak of the Flynn-Russian ambassador call very seriously, and is committed to pursuing those responsible for the disclosure of classified information. The Attorney General's vow to ""aggressively"" investigate the leak is likely to be seen as a response to criticism from Republicans and Democrats alike, who have called for the DOJ to take a more aggressive stance in addressing the issue."

Wiig, who is mostly known for her comedy chops, would be the adversary to Gal Gadot’s Diana Prince. This time the superhero has skipped ahead in time from World War II to fight crime in the 1980s. Cheetah, who was originally depicted as the alter ego of a socialite, will probably fit right in with Reagan’s America. Though, then again, since this is the Cold War she could suddenly become a Soviet. Patty Jenkins is also returning as the film’s director.","Wonder Woman 2, directed by Patty Jenkins, will be released next year, starring Gal Gadot as the titular superhero. The movie is expected to explore the character's global popularity and her mission as a hero. 

Wiig is best known for her roles in Bridesmaids and Ghostbusters, and has recently appeared in Downsizing. She has also received critical acclaim for her performances in The Martian and Mother!.

Cheetah is one of Wonder Woman's most iconic foes, and has been featured in various comic book series and animated TV shows. She has the ability to transform into a cheetah-like creature and possesses enhanced speed and agility.

If Wiig is cast as Cheetah, it would mark her first major villainous role in a blockbuster movie. She is expected to bring her signature comedic timing and depth to the role, which could make the character a more complex and compelling villain.

After years of overexposure thanks to his star-making turn in Twilight, Robert Pattinson values his privacy.

Here is your piece of news:

In a rare interview with GQ, actor Robert Pattinson has opened up about his desire for privacy in the wake of his meteoric rise to fame following the Twilight franchise. The 35-year-old star, who has been in the public eye for over a decade, revealed that he has become increasingly protective of his personal life, citing the intense media scrutiny he faced during his early years of fame as the reason for his desire for seclusion.

""I just wanted to be able to walk down the street and not be recognized,"" Pattinson told GQ in the September issue, which features the actor on the cover. ""I think there's a certain level of privacy that I've been denied for the past 10 years, and I'm trying to reclaim that.""

Pattinson's turn as the brooding vampire Edward Cullen in Twilight catapulted him to international fame, but the constant media attention took a toll on his personal life. He has been the subject of numerous tabloid headlines and paparazzi stalking, leading him to become increasingly reclusive and protective of his private life.

Despite his desire for privacy, Pattinson has continued to excel in his career, starring in critically acclaimed films such as Water for Elephants and Good Time. His upcoming projects include the highly anticipated The King's Man and Christopher Nolan's Tenet.

Pattinson's interview with GQ is a rare glimpse into his private life and offers insight into the challenges of fame in the digital age.

gossipcop-7658353025,1,0,"“A Star Is Born” is that thing we always yearn for but so rarely get to see: a transcendent Hollywood movie. It’s the fourth remake of a story that dates back to 1932, but this one has a look and vibe all its own — rapturous and swooning, but also delicate and intimate and luminous. It’s set in the present day, but in spirit it’s a sophisticated retro ’70s drama built around the uncanny flow of feeling that develops between the movie’s two stars: Bradley Cooper, who plays Jackson Maine, a hard-drinking, bad-ol’-boy redneck rock ‘n’ roller who is still hanging on as a popular attraction but has lost the lust for what he’s doing, and Lady Gaga, in her fetching and accomplished movie-star debut, as Ally, an ingenuous, fresh-faced singer-songwriter who becomes his lover and stage partner before rocketing on her own into the new pop stratosphere. She takes off as he slowly crashes — that’s the soapy tragic “Star Is Born” concept. But what the movie does is to take this fabled melodramatic romantic seesaw and turn it into something indelibly heartfelt and revealing. Cooper directed the movie himself, working from a script he co-wrote with Eric Roth and Will Fetters, and to say that he does a good job would be to understate his accomplishment. As a filmmaker, Bradley Cooper gets right onto the high wire, staging scenes that take their time and play out with a shaggy intimacy that’s shorn of the usual “beats.” The new “Star Is Born” is a total emotional knockout, but it’s also a movie that gets you to believe, at every step, in the complicated rapture of the story it’s telling. More Reviews Venice Film review: 'Isis, Tomorrow. The Lost Souls of Mosul' Telluride Film Review: 'They'll Love Me When I'm Dead' The 1976 version, starring Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson, had some terrific cornball love songs, but they didn’t belong anywhere near the stadium-rock stage, and neither did Streisand, which is part of why the movie came off as borderline ludicrous. It seemed stranded, with a kind of campy sincere ineptitude, between three worlds: Old Hollywood, New Hollywood, and Barbra Streisand rock-princess fantasy. But from the electrifying opening moments of the new version, in which Jackson, boozy and raw, with his sunburned squint and hard-bitten shit-kicker sexiness, takes the stage of a gigantic stadium and launches into a grinding slow rocker that sounds like “Victim of Love”-era Eagles as done by the Allman Brothers, the movie is thrillingly authentic. That’s no minor accomplishment. Hollywood almost never succeeds in nailing the rock world, but “A Star Is Born,” though a love story through and through, is the most lived-in rock ‘n’ roll movie since “Almost Famous.” And that absolute looks right, sounds right, feels right verisimilitude sets the stage for everything that follows. Jackson, who looks to be in his mid-40s, has been around long enough that he now occupies a grey zone between legend and nostalgia. He can still fill an arena full of screaming fans, and his old hits have become classic-rock chestnuts, but his sound and persona have long slipped out of the zeitgeist. His whole outlaw look — the beard and rancher’s hat, the Kristofferson-meets-Skynyrd soused macho twinkle — mark him as a charismatic relic, and the grand irony is this: What that look, and sound, are all about is an era when rock ‘n’ roll strutted its “authenticity,” but now that he’s out of date, Jackson’s authenticity looks more than ever like a showbiz conceit, frozen in amber. It’s a part he’s playing, an image he’s working — and secretly struggling — to keep alive. He’s got a signature ballad that goes “Maybe it’s time to let the old ways die,” and when he wrote it (long ago), he probably didn’t know that he was talking about himself. In the first of many telling jump cuts, the film leaps from his on-stage glory to Jackson slinking into the back of his car, weary and alone, grabbing the bottle of gin he’s got stashed there. He takes a guzzle, and Coop","A Star Is Born: A Transcendent Hollywood Movie

Hollywood, CA - In a season filled with blockbuster franchises and sequels, ""A Star Is Born"" stands out as a beacon of hope for those yearning for a more authentic and emotionally resonant cinematic experience. This transcendent film, starring Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, is a rare gem that delivers on its promise of a powerful and uplifting story.

From the opening frames, it is clear that ""A Star Is Born"" is something special. The cinematography is breathtaking, capturing the beauty of the American West in a way that is both intimate and grandiose. The performances from the leads are nothing short of phenomenal, with Lady Gaga delivering a career-defining turn as Ally, a talented but struggling singer who finds fame and love with Jackson Maine (Bradley Cooper), a seasoned musician with a troubled past.

The chemistry between the leads is palpable, and their performances are elevated by the film's original music, which is catchy and memorable. The story, which follows the rise of Ally from a small club performer to a global superstar, is both inspiring and heartbreaking, and the film's themes of love, loss, and redemption are timeless and universal.

What sets ""A Star Is Born"" apart from other Hollywood movies is its authenticity and vulnerability. The film is not afraid to tackle difficult subjects, such as addiction and mental health, and does so with sensitivity and empathy. The result is a movie that is both entertaining and emotionally resonant, a true masterpiece that will leave audiences moved and inspired.

In a year filled with so many mediocre and forgettable movies, ""A Star Is Born"" stands out as a shining example of what Hollywood can do when it takes risks and tells authentic stories. This is a movie that will be remembered for years to come, and is a must-see for anyone who loves cinema."

And now, he’s “in touch with emotions and his true self like never before,” the source says.  Brad Pitt finally opens up about his bitter divorce with Angelina Jolie  And it seems like this self-awareness comes with some great realisations. “He has come to realise that leaving Jen for Angelina was one of the biggest mistakes of his life,” the source adds. “And while he’s not in love with Jen, he realises how much he does love her.

It is hard to imagine a My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy — one of the greatest rap albums of all time — without an “Imma let you finish” at the 2009 VMAs.  His new album, ye, doesn’t merit any similar mercy.  On first listen, it doesn’t sound like any part of ye was recorded pre-MAGA hat picture, which blows a Kanye-head sized hole through the argument that the previous month’s behavior was a publicity stunt to promote the album. If anything, the album seems like an meek afterthought to the Twitter tirade and dive into right-wing politics. Most of it deals with the repercussions of the storm which came before it, and for the first time in his career, the artist’s personality is overwhelming the art.  The opening track ‘I Thought About Killing You’, if played in a vacuum, sounds like the work of a troubled mind. If a poem like this came from a loved one, it would surely merit discussion about a trip to the therapist. Kanye goes on to deliver cringe-worthy rhymes on issues ranging from Russell Simmons rape allegations to his petrification on realizing that his daughter might one day look like his wife. He teases a few tidbits of The Old Kanye, chopping up beats from Slick Rick and The Edwin Hawkins Singers samples on ‘No Mistakes’, to keep his fans just interested enough. It’s telling that the one standout track, ‘Ghost Town’ is the track on which Kanye lurks in the background, devoting more time on production than on spoken word, and letting John Legend and Kid Cudi take over.  If one were to ignore everything that came before ye, it would still feel like Kanye didn’t even try this time. The usual meticulousness and perfectionism has apparently been supplanted by a Kanye shrug. The music is haphazard and hollow, mirroring the guy making it.

Title: Kanye West's Reckless Behavior Turns Costly

In the past, Kanye West's capriciousness has been repeatedly forgiven and, at times, belatedly rewarded with accolades. However, his self-indulgent stunts have become a liability, threatening to derail his once-illustrious career. The recent controversy surrounding West's interruption of Taylor Swift's VMA acceptance speech has left many questioning whether the rapper has finally gone too far.

West's history of outlandish antics, from his infamous ""Imma let you finish"" moment at the 2009 VMAs to his more recent rants on Twitter, has long been met with a mix of amusement and forgiveness. But as his behavior becomes increasingly erratic and disruptive, it is no longer possible to ignore the negative impact it is having on his career.

The fallout from the VMA incident has been swift and severe. West has been widely criticized by the music industry and the public at large, with many calling for him to be banned from future awards shows. His endorsement deals are reportedly in jeopardy, and his once-thriving music sales have taken a hit.

Insiders close to West say that he is struggling to come to terms with the backlash, and that his recent Twitter rants are a sign of his increasing desperation. ""Kanye has always been a bit of a wild card, but this is getting out of hand,"" one source said. ""He needs to take a step back and reassess his priorities before it's too late.""

As the dust settles on the VMA controversy, it is clear that Kanye West's reckless behavior has turned costly. The question now is whether he can recover from this latest debacle and continue to produce the innovative, boundary-pushing music that has made him a household name. Only time will tell."

While we may have seen Johnson in some pretty intimate positions on-screen, there’s definitely a lot we don’t know about the Fifty Shades star. Like, for instance, the superfluity of familiar names in her family tree. Seeing that her popular movie, Fifty Shades Darker came out on the day of love—Valentine's Day—it's only fitting to dedicate a piece to the actress who brought us the sexy and quaint, Anastasia Steele. Johnson, after all, has become somewhat something of a Valentine’s Day staple, herself. Here are 15 facts about Dakota Johnson or, as some might call her, ""that girl from Fifty Shades of Grey."" We guarantee that she will no longer by ""that girl"" by the end of the list! 15 Her Family Tree Is Full Of Famous Faces You know how we said there are a few familiar names in her family tree? Well, we weren’t lying. Her parents are fellow actors, Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson. Unfortunately, her parents divorced in 1994 so Dakota had to split her time between the two. ""It was the only way that I could be with them,"" she said in an interview for Cosmopolitan. ""And since they were divorced, I would spend two weeks with one and two weeks with the other, traveling with a tutor."" But wait, it gets better. Her maternal grandmother (can you guess..) is Hitchcock actress Tippi Hedren. Yes, that’s right, so clearly creative talent lies in that family. We’ve never heard of a family tree with so many famous names! Thanksgiving is probably a whirlwind. Now, Dakota Johnson is another famous name in that tree. 14 She’s An Animal Rights Activist advertising Just like her grandmother Tippi Hedren, Dakota Johnson is also an animal rights activist. Like grandmother, like granddaughter shall we say? As animal lovers ourselves, we’re pleased to hear that she’s following in her grandmother’s footsteps—both in acting and in animal rights. In 2014, Johnson saved 12 horses from being slaughtered by paying for them. What a sweet thing to do! We bet her grandmother was really proud. It’s always so great to hear about celebrities doing positive things - so naturally, we’re happy to hear of Dakota’s compassionate side. We admit we have a soft spot for animal lovers, but who doesn't? We always love hearing about people doing good deeds for animals and it’s always nice to hear celebrities using their celebrity title for the better. 13 She Grew Up Shooting Guns And Riding Horses In Colorado She may play the innocent and naive Anastasia Steele in the Fifty Shades movies, but growing up Johnson was anything but naive. She grew up in Colorado at her dad’s house, where she learned to build a fire, ride a horse, ride motorbikes, and even shoot a gun. And this was all before she was just 10 years old! Sounds like a badass kid to us! But when she wasn’t at her father’s house, she was at her mom’s house in L.A. which she also loved. It's hard to imagine a 10 year old these days shooting guns, riding motorbikes, or building fires without being grounded. But it sounds like she had a pretty inspiring and freeing childhood which makes us fall for the actress all the more. 12 She Never Dates advertising By the header, we mean she never has casual relationships. She only has long-term relationships. Good for her, is all we can say! You hear of so many celebrities who are constantly dating other celebrities. You can barely keep up with who they’re dating these days. It seems to be one guy or girl after another. So it’s great to hear of Dakota’s conservative views on relationships. Apparently she’s only ever been in long-term, serious relationships; she doesn’t just date. That probably explains why she’s been in a relationship with model Matthew Hitt since 2014. Yes, it’s been a kind of an on-and-off relationship but they’ve been in it for the long haul so far. So, to sum up, we like her whole dating attitude.

Please write a piece of news based on that sentence.

Dakota Johnson, the actress known for her steamy role in Fifty Shades of Grey, has been keeping her personal life under wraps. Despite her rise to fame, there is still much we don't know about the star.

While Johnson has graced the big screen in several films, including Black Mass and A Bigger Splash, she has remained tight-lipped about her personal life. The actress has been spotted with a few high-profile beaus, but has never publicly confirmed any relationships.

Sources close to the actress have revealed that Johnson is notoriously private and prefers to keep her personal life separate from her career. This is likely a strategic move, as the actress has been the target of intense media scrutiny since her breakout role in Fifty Shades of Grey.

Despite her privacy, Johnson has been making headlines for her upcoming projects. She is set to star in the highly anticipated film, The Peanut Butter Falcon, alongside Shia LaBeouf and Zack Gottsagen. The film, which follows the story of a young man with Down syndrome who becomes a professional wrestler, promises to be a powerful and inspiring tale.

In addition to her acting career, Johnson has also been making waves in the fashion world. She has been named the face of the new Gucci fragrance, and has graced the covers of numerous fashion magazines.

gossipcop-9811720113,1,1,"I, at least, struggle to understand her career. Her performance as a junkie in “The Town” features the “Bride Wars” of Boston accents. Her performance in “The Age of Adaline” — as a woman “cursed” to stay 30 forever — was like watching a mermaid ride a bike. She tries. But her acting hasn’t yet caught up to her algorithm-generated beauty. Alas, there may be no algorithmic solution for that.  So I was less than psyched at the prospect of seeing her shiver on a buoy, stitch her own wounds, talk to animals or play a Nancy. And, as refreshing as it is watching her stand on a surfboard, it’s refreshment that provides some perspective. While some actors make sense on movie screens, there are others who might make better sense on a can of something — beer, beans, air. I can hear you, Hudson skeptics. And all I can say is that the heart wants what the heart wants. I’d actually buy whatever Ms. Hudson was on the can of.  There might be no appreciable industrial difference between what a Kate Hudson can do versus your Blake Livelys. I don’t think they’re interchangeable, but sometimes the movies beg to differ, and the market corrects itself. Don’t fall in love with Mark Harmon, because here comes Kevin Costner. And sell your Brad Rowe stock, because he’s just going to be replaced by Brad Pitt. (In the late 1990s, that pretty much happened.) But there are continuums, too. Channing Tatum, for instance, is a more elastic, hip-hop-era Brendan Fraser upgrade.  Lots of parts that have gone to Ms. Lively feel as if Ms. Hudson could have played them. But something happened, and suddenly it was someone else’s turn to be “it.” (It’s always someone else’s turn.) And part of what annoys me about the lack of Kate Hudson in my life and the surfeit of Ms. Lively is the same thing that makes me angry when a perfectly good piece of software gets a superfluous update, or a zealous waiter takes my plate at a restaurant: I wasn’t done with that.","Title: Hollywood's Latest Enigma: Actress's Career Leaves Critics Baffled

Hollywood's latest enigma is actress [Actress's Name], whose career has left critics and audiences alike baffled.

Bieber has now left Brazil and is in Argentina on the South America leg of his world tour.  He has been asked to leave the Hotel Faena in Buenoa Aires because his fans were destroying property and barricade walls put up for his arrival.

gossipcop-6722352082,1,0,"Carlotta is a fictional character from Gaston Leroux's 1909 novel The Phantom of the Opera.  In the novel, she is a minor character hailing from Spain. The first time that she is mentioned in the novel is during the chapter ""The New Marguerite"", where it is revealed that she could not perform at the ceremony for the former managers. Later in the novel, she is threatened by Erik that if she performs at the Opera House ""a great misfortune will strike"". She shrugs the warning off and performs anyway. When she does, however, croaking noises come out of her mouth and the chandelier comes crashing down. Ashamed, she hides from the public view for a few weeks, before making a return to the opera house.  Carlotta is portrayed by Virginia Pearson in the original 1925 silent film with Lon Chaney. In 1929, new sound scenes were filmed and Mary Fabian was recast as Carlotta, due to the fact that she could sing. Virginia Pearson still appeared in new scenes, now playing Carlotta's mother. These changes are also the same in the 1929 silent, foreign cut of the film (which is most commonly viewed).  In the 1943 film version, she is Mme. Biancarolli who has been drugged by the Phantom and murdered along with her maid when she tries to force him to take off his prop mask.  In Andrew Lloyd Webber's production, Carlotta (last name Giudicelli) is from Italy and is one of the major singing parts. The opera company's prima donna, she despises Christine Daaé and sees the younger woman as a threat to her job and Phantom´s courtesan, when Christine achieves prominence due to the Phantom's dirty tricks. Carlotta and tenor Ubaldo Piangi are lovers; she often turns to him for consolation when things go wrong, and she breaks down crying when his murdered body is discovered onstage. The film reveals that she likes poodles.  In the Lloyd Webber-Joel Schumacher 2004 film version, she was played by Minnie Driver.[1] Due to Driver's lack of experience in opera, her singing voice was dubbed by opera singer Margaret Preece, although she lent her actual voice to the song ""Learn to Be Lonely"" during the end credits.  In Nicholas Meyer's novel The Canary Trainer, the characters of Carlotta and La Sorelli are combined into one, despite being mentioned as separate characters in the original novel. In Kim Newman's short story ""Angels of Music"" from the Tales of the Shadowmen anthology series, Carlotta is implied to be the ancestor of Bianca Castafiore from The Adventures of Tintin comic series.","Title: A New Perspective on The Phantom of the Opera: Uncovering the Hidden Story of Carlotta

In the beloved classic The Phantom of the Opera, Gaston Leroux's 1909 novel, the character of Carlotta is often overlooked as a minor and relatively one-dimensional figure. However, a closer examination of her backstory and motivations reveals a complex and compelling tale that sheds new light on the entire opera.

Carlotta, a young Spanish soprano, is introduced as a rival to the protagonist Christine Daaé, vying for the lead role in the opera. However, her character is often portrayed as cold and snobbish, with little depth or development. But what if there was more to Carlotta than meets the eye?

New research uncovers a hidden story of Carlotta's past, revealing a traumatic childhood and a fierce determination to succeed in the cutthroat world of opera. This fresh perspective not only humanizes Carlotta but also adds a layer of depth to the entire narrative.

According to the research, Carlotta was born into a family of struggling artists and was forced to perform at a young age to support her family. This led to a traumatic experience that left her with a deep-seated fear of failure and a driving need to prove herself.

As the novel progresses, Carlotta's actions and motivations become more understandable, and her conflict with Christine takes on a new dimension. The two women are not just rivals, but also represent two different paths in life: one driven by talent and ambition, the other by fear and survival.

This new perspective on Carlotta challenges readers to reconsider their assumptions about the characters and the story as a whole. The Phantom of the Opera is not just a tale of romance and horror, but also a commentary on the human condition, and Carlotta's story is an integral part of that commentary.

In conclusion, the hidden story of Carlotta adds a new layer of depth and complexity to The Phantom of the Opera, revealing a multidimensional character that challenges readers to reconsider their assumptions about the novel and its themes. This fresh perspective is a testament to the enduring power of Leroux's classic and the timeless appeal of its characters."
gossipcop-178000221,1,0,"Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge wasn’t always a royal, but even before her marriage to Prince William, Kate Middleton had an impressive net worth.  Middleton had a comfortable upbringing before she became the first commoner to join the royal family after she married William in 2011. But Middleton’s net worth ballooned once she became a duchess.  Here’s everything we know about Middleton’s net worth:  What is Kate Middleton’s net worth?  The 36 year-old mother of three — who gave birth to a second baby boy in April — is worth at least £5 million, or $7 million, according to global wealth-tracking firm Wealth-X, though some estimates put her net worth as high as £7.3 million, or $10 million. Middleton’s wealth is mostly in cash because she doesn’t have a personal portfolio of property or artwork.  That being said, Middleton’s net worth is a lot less than her prince — Wealth-X estimates Prince William’s net worth is at least $30 million, though some reports put his fortune closer to $40 million. According to Wealth-X, $19 million of Prince William’s wealth is in cash. The wealth tracking firm also noted that William has an expensive helicopter fit for a royal — an Augusta A109S Grand helicopter which is valued at $11 million.  Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, Prince George of Cambridge and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge arrive for a children's party for Military families during the Royal Tour of Canada on September 29, 2016 in Victoria, Canada. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  What do we know about Kate Middleton’s money?  Most of Middleton’s net worth stems from Party Pieces, an online party supplies business started by her parents. The company is estimated to be worth around £30 million, or $50 million, thanks in no small part to the exposure it gets from being associated with the royals, according to royal expert Marlene Koenig.  Prior to her life as a full-time duchess, Middleton worked for the family business and was a part-time accessories buyer for a retailer called Jigsaw.  Growing up, Kate and her two siblings, Pippa and James Middleton, attended expensive privates schools from a young age, with years of tuition for just one child estimated to be at least £250,000, or $350,000. Kate met Prince William while in college in Scotland at the prestigious University of St. Andrew’s. She graduated in 2005 with a degree in Art History.  How did Kate Middleton’s net worth change after marrying Prince William?  Joining the royal family meant that Middleton was marrying into an incredible $88 billion fortune amassed over generations.  Before Will and Kate became the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and moved into a 20-room apartment in Kensington Palace, Kate lived in an apartment purchased by her parents in the Chelsea neighborhood of London believed to be worth £1 million, or $1.4 million.  Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge smile following their marriage at Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011 in London, England. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  But once Kate officially became a royal she didn’t need to spend much of her own money anymore. Most of her living costs are covered by the private estate Prince Charles manages, the Duchy of Cornwall. The revenue from the Duchy of Cornwall pays for the most of Prince Charles and his family’s royal expenses: things like official travel, wardrobe, housing and staff costs. When Meghan Markle marries Prince Harry on May 19, she too, will get to keep most of her own money — her net worth is believed to be about $5 million — as the Duchy of Cornwall will also absorb the majority of her living costs associated with royal responsibilities.  What is the ‘Kate effect’?  As the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate sets fashion trends all over the world. While she herself does not retain any income from the flurry of economic activity set off by the designer clothes she wears for public appearances, she has triggered what is known as “the Kate Effect,” ","Kate Middleton, now the Duchess of Cambridge, wasn't always a royal. Even before her marriage to Prince William, Kate had an impressive net worth that set her apart from other commoners. According to recent reports, Kate's net worth was estimated to be around $10 million, a staggering amount for someone who wasn't born into royalty.

Kate's successful career in fashion and her family's wealthy background contributed to her impressive net worth. She worked as a buying manager for a high-end clothing store before she married Prince William, and her family's business, a successful party supply company, also added to her financial portfolio.

The news comes as no surprise, given Kate's reputation as a stylish and savvy businesswoman. Her fashion choices are often scrutinized by the media, and her ability to mix high street brands with designer pieces has made her a style icon for many young women.

Kate's net worth is likely to increase even more now that she is a member of the royal family. Her marriage to Prince William has brought her a wealth of privileges and opportunities, including access to the royal family's vast resources and assets.

Overall, Kate Middleton's impressive net worth is a testament to her hard work and business acumen. She has proven that she is not just a pretty face, but a smart and capable woman who is destined for great things."

It's not an appropriate question to ask a trans person.""  But nothing else was off-limits, as Sawyer caught up with Jenner nearly two years after the TV journalist had done their last emotional interview. Then, the ex-athlete stunned the world by revealing how he had lived a lie. Inside, ex-decathlon champ Jenner had always identified as a woman.  Since then, Jenner said she has been ""happy, peaceful…all of that confusion has left me….I did the right thing"" -- and doesn't miss ""Bruce"" a bit.  Sporting red nails and stylishly feminine clothing, Jenner recalled how—when he was still known as Bruce--he had put an instruction in his will: ""When I'm buried, I want to be dressed as her 'cause that's the way I'm going to heaven.""  As many know from her former reality show, ""I Am Cait,"" Jenner is a Republican and she confided to Sawyer, ""Yes, I did vote for Trump.""  Jenner was initially impressed with Trump for reaching out to transgender people at the Republican National Convention and noted, ""He wanted me to come play golf with him.""  But Jenner got upset when President Trump's administration revoked the federal guidelines that allowed public school students to use bathrooms corresponding to their gender identity--believing it's an issue best left to state and local authorities to decide.  ""It was extremely disappointing…you mess with my community, you don't give us equality and a fair shot, I'm coming after you,"" Jenner sighed about President Trump's decision.  Although Jenner has had her jawline, forehead, and breasts worked on, she insists she's always been a woman because what's important is ""what's between your ears.""  Jenner said she's fine with her ex-wife, Kris Jenner, and stays in touch with all her kids while they pursue their own lives.  ""Nobody calls that much. I reach out to them,"" commented the former ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians"" star.  Jenner told Sawyer that she has ""never been on a date"" in the two years since she came out as transgender, and doesn't really see dating in her future.  Instead, Jenner is most focused on helping the transgender community through charities and building awareness about discrimination and other issues.  ""I want to fight this fight,"" she vowed.

It will be Carlson's first time in his new 8 p.m. EST slot.","Caitlyn Jenner has undergone the final surgery in her gender reassignment procedures, she revealed to Diane Sawyer in a special segment of ""20/20"" that aired on Friday night. According to Jenner, the surgery was a ""final step"" in her transition from male to female, and she is now feeling more confident and comfortable in her body than ever before.

Jenner, who previously went by the name Bruce Jenner before her transition, has been open about her struggles with gender identity and her decision to undergo hormone therapy and gender confirmation surgery. In the ""20/20"" special, she spoke candidly about the challenges she has faced and the support she has received from her family and the LGBTQ community.

The surgery, which was performed by a team of experienced surgeons, was a ""success"" and Jenner is now recovering and looking forward to moving on with her life, a source close to the family told ABC News.

Jenner's transition has been closely followed by the media and the public, and her story has served as an inspiration to many in the LGBTQ community. Her courage and determination to live her life as her authentic self has been praised by many, and her decision to share her journey with the world has helped to raise awareness and understanding of transgender issues.

In a statement released after the segment aired, Jenner thanked her family, friends, and the medical team who have supported her throughout her transition. She also expressed her hope that her story will continue to inspire others and promote acceptance and understanding of all gender identities."

The singer is looking out for her girl, Khloe Kardashian, and wants her to know she’s risking ‘serious heartbreak’ trusting Tristan Thompson with his ex. Read on for all the EXCLUSIVE details.  Iggy Azalea, 26, knows a lot about heartbreak when it comes to dealing with men. Especially, those who are still connected to their exes. That said, The New Classic artist is trying to get word to Khloe Kardashian, 32, that Tristan Thompson, 25, may break her heart if she’s not careful.  “Iggy’s not trying to be salty or hate on Tristan but she’s hit up French [Montana], and told her he needs to put Khloe up on game and warn her that she’s putting herself at risk for serious heartbreak with him,” a source close to Iggy told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “Iggy explained to French that these basketball players are no joke and don’t care whose heart they break in their quest to bang every girl that breathes.”  “Iggy still feels some type of way after Nick [Young] cheated on her and then on top of that got his baby mama pregnant – again,” the source continued. “She’s sticking to the girl code and would hate for Khloe to experience the same type of pain she did. She’s hoping French gets to her before it’s too late.”  As HollywoodLife.com previously reported, it’s really hard for KoKo to ignore the rumors that TT and his baby mama, Jordy Craig, are still hooking up. In fact, we’re told Khloe’s hired some private eyes to keep tabs on her dude. “She loves Tristan wholeheartedly and he’s been nothing but a stand-up, loving man,” another source told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “But she can’t help but worry sometimes. Khloe spends as much time in Cleveland as possible and has spies in every city his team plays in.”  HollywoodLifers, do you think Khloe will listen to Iggy?","Title: Iggy Azalea Warns Khloe Kardashian of Tristan Thompson's Ex

As the world continues to celebrate International Women's Day, Australian rapper Iggy Azalea is taking a stand for her fellow woman, Khloe Kardashian. The singer, who has been open about her own experiences with heartbreak, is sounding the alarm about Tristan Thompson's ex, Jordan Craig, and the potential for ""serious heartbreak"" that Khloe may face if she continues to trust the basketball player with his ex.

According to sources close to the situation, Iggy has been in contact with Khloe and has expressed her concerns about Tristan's past actions. The ""Fancy"" rapper is said to be deeply worried about the impact that Jordan's presence in Tristan's life may have on Khloe, especially given the history of infidelity that has already been well-documented.

""Iggy is coming from a place of love and concern for Khloe,"" a source told us. ""She's been through a lot herself, and she knows how painful heartbreak can be. She's urging Khloe to be cautious and to protect her own heart, especially when it comes to Tristan and Jordan.""

Iggy's warning comes as no surprise, given her own experiences with Tristan's friend and former teammate, Nick Young. The two were engaged before Nick's infidelity scandal came to light, and Iggy has been open about the pain and betrayal she felt as a result.

While Khloe has thus far remained silent on the situation, it's clear that Iggy is looking out for her girl and is determined to make sure she's aware of the potential risks involved in trusting Tristan with his ex. Only time will tell if Khloe will heed Iggy's warning, but one thing is certain: the Australian rapper is not afraid to speak her mind and stand up for what she believes in."

We’ve got the pics of their steamy Mexican getaway  Rihanna has kept her one year romance with Saudi billionaire Hassan Jameel super private. So when rumors surfaced in June that they had broken up fans were waiting to see proof they were still a couple. They got it on July 9 when pics surfaced of the 30-year-old singer and the businessman on a sexy Mexican getaway. The two appeared to be locked in a animated conversation as bikini clad RiRi is seen pointing her right index finger in the air with her mouth open, looking like she had something important to say. In another pic Hassan is seen looking back at her with his hand on his chest as if they’re involved in a somewhat heated conversation. CLICK HERE to see all the pics.  On June 1 MediaTakeOut claimed RiRi had dumped Hassan. The site reported that “Rihanna just got tired of him. She gets tired of men sometimes,” an alleged insider told them. They said that the handsome billionaire wasn’t doing too well after the split. “Of course Rihanna broke his heart. That’s what she does — break men’s hearts.” Since Rihanna has never commented on her romance with Hassan and goes to great lengths to keep their relationship away from the public eye, MTO’s report spread like wildfire.  Obviously something is still on between Rihanna and Hassan, as they are having a hot summer together. They were first photographed a year ago making out in a pool in Spain. They’ve only been pictured a handful of times since, keeping their love undercover. The “Work” singer’s previous relationship was with Drake, 31, and it played out in public. He even professed his years of love to her in front of the world while presenting her with the Video Vanguard award at the 2016 VMAs. After having the public know all about their dating business, Ri has wisely kept her romance with Hassan as far out of the public eye as possible.  Rihanna revealed recently that Drake gushing about her on live TV made her cringe. In a May 2018 interview with Vogue, she said “Waiting through that speech was probably the most uncomfortable part. I don’t like too many compliments; I don’t like to be put on blast.” As for where she stands with Drizzy, she told the mag that they haven’t spoken and that “We don’t have a friendship now, but we’re not enemies either. It is what it is.” However she did come the close to discussing her relationship with Hassan, telling the publication that she dating and she is happy. “I used to feel guilty about taking personal time,” she revealed, “but I also think I never met someone who was worth it before,” she said about her romance with Hassan.","But now we can exclusively reveal the couple is still going strong, and has been enjoying a romantic vacation in Mexico.

Over the past few weeks, rumors have been swirling that the pair had called it quits, but sources close to the singer tell us that is simply not the case. In fact, Rihanna and Hassan were spotted packing on the PDA during a beach day in Tulum, Mexico on Thursday.

And if you need any more proof that this power couple is still going strong, just check out the pics we've obtained of their steamy vacation. In one shot, Rihanna can be seen wrapped in Hassan's arms, as they gaze lovingly into each other's eyes. In another, the pair are seen sharing a passionate kiss on the beach.

The couple has been notoriously private about their relationship, but it looks like they're not afraid to show some PDA on vacation. We're told that they've been spending quality time together in Mexico, and that their romance is stronger than ever.

So, put those breakup rumors to rest: Rihanna and Hassan Jameel are still going strong, and they're not afraid to show it."

Abrams sought to put concerns about potential CGI resurrections to rest, saying that the new movie will use “unseen footage we shot together in Episode VII” and assuring fans that “we were never going to recast, or use a CG character.” While this is, undoubtedly, comforting, it would also appear to offer particular clues about the role Fisher — or, more specifically, her character, Leia Organa — will play in the movie.  Firstly: Purely for practical purposes, Leia’s presence in the movie will be small. If nothing else, there can’t be that much extraneous, unseen footage from 2015's Star Wars: The Force Awakens; she was barely in that movie, so unless large swaths of scenes were shot but never even hinted at by anyone involved in the production, there’s limited material to draw from in the first place, and surely not everything available will be used.  Considering the context of the footage, it also limits the potential use for Episode IX. Leia appeared in few scenes and locations in The Force Awakens. Leia was on Takodana, rescuing Han, Chewbacca, Rey and Finn, and then at the Resistance base on D’Qar, where she takes part in planning, and later monitoring, the attack on Starkiller Base. Aside from brief interludes with Han and, later, Rey, she’s very much in “harried leader” mode throughout the movie. Does this mean that this is the Leia we’ll see in Episode IX, even after losing her ex-husband, and then her brother, in the previous two movies?  (It’s possible that the Fisher footage will end up being just a minor flashback, used to punctuate a contemporary moment; memories during her funeral, as some on social media have already suggested. If so, then the above problem is side-stepped, to a degree.)  Abrams’ comments leave space for some level of postproduction trickery to be applied to the Fisher footage. Presumably, Fisher will be intercut with new footage of actors shot specifically for Episode IX. Will digital trickery be used to make sure that Fisher shares a location with the other cast members? If so, will that be all that’s altered? What about costuming choices? For that matter, what about the potential for posthumous dubbing or soundalikes used for dialogue where Leia is off-camera or not in close-up? Abrams said that the movie would never use a CG character, but what about a performance augmented or altered by CG?  Of course, if any such edits or alterations are made, they’ll have to be done with subtlety and sensitivity. This is key to the entire enterprise of including footage of Fisher posthumously. For as much as fans want to be able to say goodbye to the actress, and also to Leia, they want to do so in a manner that feels appropriate and respectful to both. While Abrams and Lucasfilm — and Fisher’s family, especially daughter Billie Lourd, named in Abrams’ statement — want to provide both closure and tribute to Leia and Fisher alike with this move, they’re courting backlash if this isn’t done perfectly.  That the footage will come from The Force Awakens feels particularly fitting, then; that, after all, was a project that already came with expectations and looming accusations from fandom expecting the worst. It’s also perhaps a reminder that those involved with this move love the mythology — and loved Fisher as a person — as much as anyone else, if not more so, and will be approaching it with the utmost care.  Everyone will, inevitably, remain worried until the final product appears onscreen, but perhaps we can rest just slightly in the meantime.","I want you to create a news piece based on the provided sentence.

The talk show host on Sunday posted a photo on Instagram of him and his wife boarding a private jet.  “Vacation time is here, let’s go girl,” he captioned the Sunday, July 8 image.  The photo, which was similar to one Marjorie posted on her Instagram Story, got praise from fans.  “God bless….. stay focus[ed] don’t [lose] the vision🙏💍.”  “Enjoy yourselves, you guys deserve this vacation. Come back well rested and a stronger bond and marriage. Yahoo for the Harveys.”  Days earlier, RadarOnline reported that Marjorie walked out on Steve because he had been getting close with Kris Jenner during closed-door business meetings and ongoing phone calls and text messages.  “There was a huge blowout fight and Marjorie walked out threatening divorce,” a source told the gossip site of the reported split. “There’s no way she was going to put up with Steve hanging around a man-eater like Kris — especially since he’s proven time and again he can’t be trusted.”  Although Jenner was reportedly just stringing Steve along to get tips on TV success, one of his former talk show employes said Marjorie knows her man, who is twice divorced and cheated on both wives with the next.  “Steve has a wandering eye and he loves women!” the ex-worker told Radar anonymously. “He’s cheated during his previous marriages, and Marjorie knows he could do it again. She knows her man’s weakness — knows everything about him! That’s why she watches him so closely.”  The rumor was the talk of Twitter.  “Am I late?? Did everyone know Steve Harvey is being accused of cheating on Marjorie with Kris Jenner?! I didn’t know this 😂.”  “Steve Harvey left his wife to marry Marjorie, his side b—- of 20 years, and now she’s leaving him and running his pockets. Hilarious. Karma’s a bad b—-.”  “Boyyy if this Steve Harvey rumor is true… he gon be sick for a minute. He loves him some Marjorie.”","Steve took to his Instagram to share a photo of himself and his wife on vacation with the caption “Vacation time is here, let’s go girl.” The post immediately shut down the rumors that had been circulating online and set the record straight that the couple is still very much together. In the photo, Steve and Marjorie can be seen smiling and embracing each other while enjoying their time off together. It appears that the rumors of a possible divorce were nothing more than unfounded gossip. A representative for Steve Harvey also released an official statement confirming that the couple is happy and in no way is their marriage in jeopardy.

Denzel Washington's Recent Remarks Spark Rare Moment of Sanity in Hollywood

In a refreshing departure from the usual bombast and grandstanding that characterizes much of Hollywood's social commentary, award-winning actor Denzel Washington recently made some thoughtful and measured remarks that have left many in the entertainment industry and beyond taking notice.

Speaking at a gathering of industry professionals, Washington, known for his powerful performances in films like ""Training Day"" and ""Malcolm X,"" addressed the pressing need for greater understanding and unity among people of different backgrounds and beliefs.

""We're all human beings, folks,"" he declared. ""We all have the same needs, the same desires, the same hopes and fears. We all bleed the same color blood. So why can't we just get along?""

Washington's remarks were met with a standing ovation from the crowd, many of whom were visibly moved by his words.

""It's so rare to hear someone in Hollywood speak with such sensitivity and intelligence about the issues that really matter,"" said one attendee, who wished to remain anonymous. ""Denzel's words were a breath of fresh air in a industry that often seems more concerned with promoting divisive rhetoric than promoting meaningful dialogue and understanding.""

Washington's comments come at a time when tensions are high in the United States and around the world, with many people feeling increasingly polarized and disconnected from one another.

As one industry insider put it, ""Denzel's remarks serve as a powerful reminder that, no matter our differences, we are all human beings worthy of respect and dignity. It's time for us to start acting like it.""

With his thoughtful and inclusive approach to social commentary, Denzel Washington has once again proven himself to be a beacon of sanity and compassion in the often chaotic and self-serving world of Hollywood."
gossipcop-8854037683,1,0,"Titanic II is set to launch in less than two years — not in movie theaters, but on the open sea.  A replica of the world’s most famous “unsinkable” ship — which struck an iceberg and sank on its maiden voyage on April 15, 1912, killing 1,503 people — is under construction, with a maiden voyage planned for 2018.  Australian tycoon and politician Clive Palmer — not J. Bruce Ismay — is at the helm of the ambitious project to faithfully recreate the luxury ship, which will be about 13 feet wider to meet current regulations.  More importantly, it will carry enough lifeboats for every passenger and its hull will be welded, not riveted, just in case it comes across a rogue iceberg, the Belfast Telegraph reports.  “The new Titanic will of course have modern evacuation procedures, satellite controls, digital navigation and radar systems and all those things you’d expect on a 21st-century ship,” James McDonald, global marketing director of Palmer’s company, Blue Star Line, told the paper.  The new nine-deck ship will be 885 feet long, about two more than her doomed predecessor, 174 feet high and have a maximum speed of 24 knots. She will accommodate 2,400 passengers — 177 more than the RMS Titanic.  It also will feature the same categories of passengers — from the first-class movers and shakers to the hoi polloi in third class, where poor Leonardo DiCaprio was berthed in the classic movie.  Unlike the Belfast-built original, the Titanic II is under construction by the CSC Jinling Shipyard in Jiangsu, China.  Its maiden voyage will not be from Southampton to New York, but rather from Jiangsu, China, to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, the paper reported.  Some of the dead passengers’ relatives have criticized the plans for a new Titanic, but Blue Star has reportedly been flooded with requests for tickets — with some offering up to about $900,000 for a spot on the first trip.","Titanic II is set to launch in less than two years — not in movie theaters, but on the open sea.

In a shocking turn of events, a modern-day replica of the infamous RMS Titanic is set to set sail in less than two years, braving the same treacherous waters that claimed the lives of over 1,500 passengers and crew members more than a century ago.

The Titanic II, a luxury cruise liner owned by Blue Star Line, is scheduled to embark on its maiden voyage from England to New York in the spring of 2024, following a meticulous restoration of the original ship's design and specifications.

While the thought of revisiting the site of one of history's deadliest maritime disasters may be unsettling to some, the Titanic II's builders and operators are confident in the ship's safety and modern technology.

""We have taken every precaution to ensure the safety of our passengers and crew,"" said a spokesperson for Blue Star Line. ""From state-of-the-art navigation systems to enhanced life-saving equipment, the Titanic II is a testament to human ingenuity and resilience.""

The Titanic II will feature many of the original ship's iconic features, including its grand staircases, opulent dining rooms, and gleaming wood paneling. However, modern amenities such as air conditioning, flat-screen TVs, and wireless internet will also be included to provide a comfortable and luxurious experience for passengers.

Despite the risks involved, the Titanic II is expected to attract thousands of eager passengers and history buffs who are eager to experience a piece of living history.

Tickets for the maiden voyage are already selling out fast, with prices starting at $10,000 per person for a luxury cabin.

The Titanic II's launch is set to be a major event, with celebrities and dignitaries expected to attend. The ship's builders and operators are also planning a series of commemorative events and exhibitions to honor the memory of the original Titanic's passengers and crew.

As the world prepares for the Titanic II's maiden voyage, one thing is certain: the spirit of the original Titanic will live on in this modern-day replica, providing a unique and unforgettable experience for all who set sail on its decks."

After deciding that she just can’t let go of this hunk, Mariah reportedly decided to make it happen – an engagement, that is! “Word is Mariah took matters into her own hands,” a source tells OK! magazine, “It was an unusual proposal but it did the trick.

That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired.
