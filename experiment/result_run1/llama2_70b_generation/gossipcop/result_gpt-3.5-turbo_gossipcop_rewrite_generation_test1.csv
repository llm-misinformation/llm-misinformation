Dancing With the Stars will return for its 22nd season with Len Goodman back where he belongs, Bindi Irwin as the reigning champ, and a baby boy or girl for Allison Holker. There's much to look forward to, but not before we close out this season one last time with everything that happened after the finale! (In case you missed it, you can read our recap of the best and worst moments here .) Almost an hour after Tom Bergeron declared Bindi Irwin and Derek Hough the winners of season 21, Bindi was still in disbelief, shouting from the top of her lungs, ""I think I'm going to scream for 20 minutes!"" Her exuberance and genuine nature endeared her to literally every one on set, but no one more so than Derek. ""It's just so special with Bindi,"" he told reporters backstage. ""She's a champion of life."" Bindi shared the same sentiment, telling those in the ballroom that she gained another brother in Derek. In case you needed further proof that the two are friends for life, consider this: Derek's hopping on a plane to Australia in a couple weeks ""to tackle crocodiles and get my official khakis!"" The Houghster may have nabbed his sixth Mirrorball trophy, but it was his partnership with Bindi that undoubtedly made it his favorite season. ""There's not a thing I would change about this season,"" he told Glamour post-show. ""There's not a week I would change, a dance I would change, and that was a very calming, very peaceful feeling. The show is a completely different show than the first time I won, and to win at this level and the standard that this show has been raised to, it's been incredible."" While Bindi and Derek make the press rounds in New York City, it's no secret that she's itching to get back to her hometown down under. ""I can't wait to get back to all the animals, continue all the conservation work, and carry on in my dad's footsteps."" Season 21 runner-ups Sharna Burgess and Nick Carter were understandably disappointed not to win the big prize, but they both praised Bindi and Derek for their phenomenal journey this season. ""Bindi was the whole package,"" praised the red-haired stunner. ""She and Derek had a beautiful partnership."" Still, ""it's bittersweet in may ways. Did I really want this to be my first Mirrorball? Absolutely. I would be lying if I said I didn't. But Bindi was undeniable this entire season. She grew so much, and she's just such a beautiful person you can't help but be captivated by her. Both [she and Nick] are winners, and I truly believe that."" Echoed Nick: ""It was just such a pleasure to be here. I didn't expect to get anything, so anytime something great happened in the competition, it was a pleasant surprise to me."" So what's up next for Nick? Well, aside from getting ready for Baby Boy Carter , his solo album ( All American ) drops today, and he has a movie coming out next year that he wrote and directed. As for third-place contestant, Alek Skarlatos , he'll be heading on the DWTS Tour this winter, but his immediate plans are much simpler: ""I can't wait to get on the plane tonight to eat. A lot."" But what about his dating life? Any updates on that? ""It's been pretty crazy, honestly. [I haven't had time] for many dates lately."" Added Lindsay: ""I'll be his wing woman on tour!"" During all the hectic action backstage, Allison Holker was a ball of energy, especially for someone six month's pregnant. ""I feel incredible!"" gushed the pro. ""Dancing around with a baby that's the size of a football in your belly is never an easy task, but it's been amazing. Although I never expected to see myself in a sparkly costume on the Dancing With the Stars stage six months pregnant!"" Allison (and husband tWitch) will find out the baby's gender on December 10, ""which is our anniversary too."" In case you're wondering, she'll reveal whether it's a boy or a girl on social media shortly thereafter! In the meantime, Allison's prepping for her first Thanksgiving in charge of the turkey as long as the ne","Irwin was incredible."" For a full recap of the season 21 finale, click here."

The son of an Army major, Strahan grew up in Germany and did not play competitive high school football until his senior year when his parents sent him to live with his aunt and uncle in Texas.  The former defensive end played well enough to earn a scholarship to Texas Southern University. By his senior year of college, he had set a record for sacks, which got the attention of the NFL.  In 1993, the New York Giants drafted Strahan as the 40th overall draft pick. Over the next 14 seasons, he became the league’s all-time quarterback sack leader, played in the Pro Bowl and helped the Giants defeat the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLII.  Upon retiring in 2008, Strahan concentrated on his off-field talents. In 2012, he became Kelly Ripa’s “Live! With Kelly” co-host, replacing longtime host Regis Philbin. Four years later, he left the show and joined ABC’s “Good Morning America”; it took more than a year for “Live” to announce Ryan Seacrest as its new co-host.  Strahan also serves as a Fox NFL Sunday analyst during the football season.  As of May 2017, Strahan’s net worth was $65 million, with a salary of $17 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.

gossipcop-7392274516,1,0,"They both looked so happy, and so relaxed. They were beaming as they said their vows, and luckily, no one came forward to provide any reason that they might not be married. (This is always an exciting moment in a ceremony.) It was an extraordinary mix of tradition and modernity, of centuries of history and up-to-the moment flourishes. Oprah was here, and so was Meghan’s mother, an African-American social worker who wore a conventional mother-of-the-bride outfit and also a nose stud. It somehow looked charming and just right. The entire royal family was here, along with a complement of English aristocrats and important personages. The music was stately and beautiful. The setting was awe-inspiring. There was a flotilla of clergymen, an extraordinary mélange including the archbishop of Canterbury and — in a striking inclusion in this most ancient of places — the head of the Episcopal Church, the Most Rev. Michael Curry. Chosen to give the address to the congregations, Bishop Curry, who is African-American, quoted Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. His voice rising and falling with emotion, he made a big, generous, impassioned case for love as the most important thing there is, in religion and in life. His address came after a reading by Lady Jane Fellowes, Harry’s aunt (her sister was Diana, Princess of Wales) that was both full of joy and a signal, it seemed, that the sadness in Harry’s life since his mother’s death had finally lifted. It was a passage from the Song of Solomon: “Arise my love, my fair one, and come away; for now the winter is past, the rain is over and gone.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story The dress was a success: sculptural simplicity. Photo Our fashion critic, Vanessa Friedman, is also watching, and she has a quick take for us on Meghan Markle’s dress. It was absolutely simple: pure and sculptural, in double bonded silk cady with a wide boatneck, long sleeves and sweeping train. It was Meghan Markle’s wedding dress. It was by Clare Waight Keller, a British woman and the first female designer of Givenchy. And it was everything people had hoped. This was not a Cinderella choice, not one that spoke of fantasy or old-fashioned fairy tales. Instead, it placed the woman proudly front and center and underscored Ms. Markle’s own independence. At the same time, it celebrated female strength, promoted a local designer and reached a hand across to Europe (where Ms. Waight Keller has a day job). The five-meter veil was of silk tulle, with a trim of hand-embroidered flowers in silk threads and organza, and contained embroidery representing the flora of all 53 Commonwealth nations. Video And it was entirely a surprise. In all the rumors that had swirled around The Dress, from Ralph & Russo to Stella McCartney, Ms. Waight Keller’s name had never come up. In the end, Ms. Markle outthought us all. As this starts, long may it continue. And the After-Party Dress The newly minted Duke and Duchess of Sussex departed Windsor for their evening reception at Frogmore House in a very James Bond fashion. The duchess wore a second dress by designer Stella McCartney. You can read our fashion critic Vanessa Friedman’s reaction here. Advertisement Continue reading the main story A good time was had by all (even before the cocktails). Photo Unlike a lot of weddings — and certainly unlike Kate and William’s wedding, just seven years ago — the guests inside hung out in the aisles, air-kissing and gossiping. It’s a great royal-and-celebrity cocktail party! (Sadly without cocktails.) Kate and William’s wedding was solemn, stately, stuffy, full of dignitaries, politicians, and the sort of boring personages known here as the great and the good. But this looked totally fun for the guests — even more fun than, say, the Academy Awards — because no one was competing for anything and no one was forced to talk about their outfits to television reporters. Part of the change in tone is down to the passage of time and to how much Britain, or perhaps","Idris Elba, in a smart three-piece suit, strolled in. The singer James Blunt, a friend of Harry’s, was there, as was the model and actress Cara Delevingne. And then there was Elton John, in a smart pink three-piece suit, a longtime friend of the royal family, and a man who has seen a lot of history. (He played at Diana’s funeral.)

The atmosphere at the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was one of pure joy and celebration. The couple exuded happiness and relaxation as they said their vows and sealed their love for each other. The blend of tradition and modernity was evident throughout the ceremony, from the music to the attire of the guests. The Episcopal Church's head, Bishop Michael Curry, delivered a powerful address that emphasized the importance of love in religion and life. The dress worn by Meghan Markle was a stunning success, a simple yet sculptural design that celebrated female strength and independence. The wedding was a beautiful reflection of the couple's love for each other, and it marked a new era for the royal family.

The guests at the wedding, including Oprah Winfrey, the Beckhams, and the Clooneys, added to the excitement and celebratory atmosphere. The list of invitees was kept secret until the moment they entered St. George's Chapel, adding to the anticipation and suspense. The wedding was a unique blend of royal tradition and modern flair, with a focus on love, happiness, and inclusivity. It was a joyous celebration that will be remembered for years to come."
gossipcop-470066082,1,0,"Demi Lovato has sparked rumors of a new romance with Lauren Abedini, a Los Angeles-based DJ who goes by the stage name Kittens. According to Page Six, Lovato was spotted holding hands with Abedini in Disneyland over the weekend, causing fans and media outlets to speculate whether they could be dating. This is only the latest speculation surrounding Lovato’s love life, as the pop singer has never officially confirmed her sexuality– despite alluding to her being bisexual in her song lyrics. Here’s what you need to know about Demi Lovato’s sexuality: 1.

She’s Had Relationships With Several Male Celebrities Lovato, like most notable celebrities, have dated other people in the industry. According to Pop Sugar, she dated The Cab frontman Alex DeLeon from 2008-09, and later based the breakup song “Catch Me” on him. Lovato also had brief flings with Trace Cyrus (Miley’s older brother) in 2009 and Joe Jonas, her self-proclaimed “BFF,” in 2010. Her most notable relationship to date, however, has been with Valderrama, whom she dated from from 2010 to 2016. In an interview with Latina magazine, Lovato discussed what attracted her to the That 70’s Show actor: When I dated white guys, it wasn’t as passionate as my relationship with Wilmer. Maybe that’s just Wilmer. But I do believe that Latin people are just more expressive, more passionate with their emotions. He’s very manly, and he can be stubborn like Latino men can, but he’s protective and he cares so much and loves so hard. I’ve been blessed enough to have him in my life, and not just as my man, but also my best friend. Since her breakup from Valderrama, Lovato’s been seen with MMA fighter Guilherme “Bomba” Vasconcelos and Abedini. 3. Ruby Rose Claims that She & Lovato ‘Hooked Up’ in 2013 In 2013, model and actress Ruby Rose turned heads when she tweeted that she had a lesbian tryst with Lovato. “I’m like the one person demi has slept with that didn’t sell on naked photos of her so eff off,” Rose tweeted out. She went on to say “Think ill take a few days off social media whilst @ddlovato’s friends attack me for being a ‘scorned ex-lover’ get over it! I liked the hair.” Furthermore, a source for Life & Style said that Rose and Lovato dated for two years while the singer took a break from her relationship with Valderrama. A post shared by Ruby Rose (@rubyrose) on Aug 13, 2017 at 1:32pm PDT Lovato addressed these claims in a 2015 interview with Complex magazine. “Rumours are rumours, a","to take a bite” were interpreted by many to mean that she was bisexual. In an interview with Hits 97.3, Lovato responded to the rumours with the following statement: “I’m not confirming, and I’m definitely not denying. All of my songs are based off of personal experiences. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with experimentation at all.” She went on to say that “I think that’s a good thing. It’s a part of life.” Lovato has yet to speak publicly about her relationship with Abedini, and it’s clear that she values her privacy. The pop star is certainly entitled to share or withhold information about her personal life as she sees fit."
gossipcop-5319163677,1,0,"Come December, it's become near tradition over the past few years for everyone to complain about how the previous 12 months have been the worst ever. This year, however really, really feels like it. This year has been a barrage of bizarre and bummer headlines that at times it's felt like some dystopian nightmare.  It's been so bad that the Kardashian-West clan have just decided to end 2016 early. Yes, Kim and Kanye have decided to cancel all public and professional commitments for the end of the year and plan to maintain their social media blackouts as well. To be exact, a flack told Page Six that Kim and Kanye “plan on taking the rest of 2016 off and spending time as a family.""  Which, frankly, we wish we all could do, don't we?  Is it possible for President Obama's last major act to be an executive decree for us to just all get a chance to chill out and recuperate for the remaining 26 days left in this bummer of a year? Sure, there's no political safeguarding against any potential additional music legends from dying or preventing any further tragedies and disasters from happening or ensuring that some new odd Zika-like disease pops up, but there's got to be something? How about the ""Netflix and Chill Act?"" Just an order that all Americans get to spend the next month relaxing and catching up on any television series they may have missed this year.  Of course, when it comes to Kim and Kanye it's understandable that they've decided to literally cancel the rest of their 2016. Kim was still in the midst of recuperating from being robbed at gunpoint in Paris when her husband Kanye was hospitalized following a very public breakdown.  They've had to endure these private tragedies while also dealing with immense public interest and rumors running rampant in the tabloid press.  E!, the home of the Kardashian's reality TV empire, reports that a family source says ""Kim is doing okay despite reports.""  ""She has many things on her plate so being overwhelmed is expected,"" the source continued. ""She wants to get Kanye back on his feet. She is not leaving him. She loves him.""  Kanye was released from an L.A.-area hospital last week after spending more than a week receiving treatment for exhaustion. Kim West was reportedly by his side throughout the entire ordeal and now wants to make sure Kanye continues to receive therapy and treatment now that he's out of the hospital.  Despite your personal opinion on the pair, it certainly does seem like the family deserves the rest. In addition to their dual ordeal, they also have two young children to care for after all (in fact, today is Saint West's first birthday). Maybe it's best we all let them lay low and chill for the next month or so.  Unfortunately, we all don't have the luxury as much as we wish we could. Then again, it's not looking like 2017 is shaping up to be any better. Hopefully, a rested and healthier Kim and Kanye can get back into form and provide us with the not-quite-as-tragic-as-this distractions we'll probably desperately need in the new year.  Update: Kanye, for one, has now reappeared in public, albeit in a very low-key way. He was spotted with newly blond hair at designer Rick Owens' furniture show in Los Angeles .","Kim, meanwhile, has been sharing a steady stream of adorable videos and photos of the couple's two children, North and Saint, on her Snapchat.  It's clear that the family is trying to move on from this tumultuous year, and we wish them all the best."

The groom, Prince Harry, is a member of the British royal family; the bride, Meghan Markle, is an American and former actress.[note 1] On the morning of the wedding, Prince Harry's grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, conferred upon him the titles of Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel. On her marriage, Markle became Duchess of Sussex.[1] The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, officiated at the wedding using the standard Anglican church service for Holy Matrimony published in Common Worship, the liturgical text of the Church of England.[2][3] Announcement of engagement [ edit ] Prince Harry is the second son of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Diana, Princess of Wales. He and Meghan Markle, an American actress best known for her role in the Canadian-American legal-drama television series Suits, have been in a relationship since 2016, having first met in July 2016.[4] The relationship was officially acknowledged on 8 November 2016, when a statement was released from the royal family's communications secretary addressing the ""wave of abuse and harassment"" directed toward Markle.[5] Harry and Meghan attending church on Christmas Day, 2017 On 27 November 2017, Clarence House announced that Prince Harry would marry Markle in the spring of 2018.[6] They were engaged earlier the same month in London, with the Prince giving Markle a bespoke engagement ring made by Cleave and Company, the court jewellers and medalists to the Queen, consisting of a large central diamond from Botswana, with two smaller diamonds from his mother's jewellery collection.[7] At the same time, it was announced that they would live at Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace following their marriage.[8] The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh expressed their delight at the news, while congratulations came in from various political leaders, including the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, and the Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn. After the announcement, the couple gave an exclusive interview to Mishal Husain of BBC News.[8] During the public announcement of the engagement at Kensington Palace's Sunken Gardens, Markle wore a bottle knee-length emerald green dress with bow detailing at the cinched waist by Italian label P.A.R.O.S.H and a white trench coat by Canadian brand Line the Label.[9][10] Hours after the announcement, the website of Line the Label crashed down due to the number of people who were trying to order the coat.[7][11] Markle is the second American[note 2] and the first person of mixed race heritage to marry into the British royal family.[12] The engagement announcement prompted much comment about the possible social significance of Markle becoming a proudly mixed-race royal.[13][14][15][16][17] Under the terms of the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, the first six persons in the line of succession require the Sovereign's consent in order to marry.

It was reported that Markle chose not to wear a tiara, instead wearing a diamond bandeau created by Queen Mary and lent to her by the Queen.[46] Guests [ edit ] Invitations were sent out to 600 guests in late March.[47] In addition to the royal family, politicians, and other public figures, 2,640 people were invited to watch the arrivals of the guests at Windsor Castle, and 1,200 people from the charities and military organisations that Prince Harry supports were invited to watch from within the castle grounds.[48] Celebrities, including the Beckhams, the Clooneys, and the Obamas, were also invited to the wedding.[49] As Prince Harry's mother, Princess Diana, was a popular figure, her siblings, including Earl Spencer and Lady Sarah McCorquodale, were invited to the wedding.[50] Excluded from the guest list were Prince Harry's aunts, Princess Anne, and Princess Alexandra, as well as his first cousin, twice removed, Margaret Rhodes, who was a bridesmaid at Queen Elizabeth II's wedding in 1947.[51] Wedding party [ edit ] Prince Harry's best man was his brother, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, while Markle chose her close friend, Jessica Mulroney, as her maid of honor.[52] Prince George and Princess Charlotte of Cambridge served as page boy and bridesmaid, respectively, as did Harry's goddaughters, Florence van Cutsem, and Zalie Warren.[53] Music [ edit ] The wedding music was under the direction of James Vivian, Director of Music at St George's Chapel, and included a variety of classical and contemporary works. The cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason, winner of the 2016 BBC Young Musician contest, performed during the signing of the register.[54] The gospel choir Karen Gibson and the Kingdom Choir performed ""Stand by Me"", which was described as a ""spine-tingling"" moment.[55] Hymns sung during the service included ""Love Divine All Loves Excelling"" and ""Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer"".[56] Pre-wedding activities [ edit ] On the eve of the wedding, Prince Harry and Markle held a private reception, attended by close friends and family, at the Frogmore House, Windsor Great Park.[57] The wedding eve traditionally involves the bride and groom's families getting to know each other better and celebrating with food and drinks.[58] Post-wedding activities [ edit ] After the wedding, the couple rode through Windsor in a carriage procession, before attending a reception at St George's Hall, followed by an evening reception at Frogmore House.[59] The couple's first public engagement as husband and wife was at Prince Charles's 70th birthday party, held at Buckingham Palace on 22 May 2018.[60] Philanthropy [ edit ] The couple asked that, in lieu of gifts, donations be made to seven charities: the Children's HIV Association, the Cintréal en association avec les Invictus Games Foundation, the Direct Relief, the Heads Together, the Hope and Homes for Children, the Humanitas, and the WellChild.[61] This choice of charities reflected the couple's ""passion for youth empowerment, education, humanitarian work and conservation.""[62] The wedding cake, made by Claire Ptak, was a lemon elderflower cake, decorated with Swiss meringue buttercream and 150 fresh flowers, including peonies and white roses, which were donated by the royal estates.[63] The cake was cut at the evening reception, with a small portion being sent to the staff of St. George's Chapel and the reception at Windsor Castle, as a thank you for their work on the day.[64] After the wedding, the couple travelled to the Seychelles for their honeymoon.[65] On 24 May 2018, Kensington Palace announced that the couple would be known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.[66] The titles were conferred by Queen Elizabeth II, with Prince Harry becoming the Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel, and Meghan Markle becoming the Duchess of Sussex.

As might be expected, the Internet had plenty of opinions about the newest Kardashian-West offspring and took to the web to share them.","But Kim and Kanye’s fans were quick to defend the name and point out its unique significance.   According to a source close to the family, Kim and Kanye have been considering this name for a long time, even before the baby was born. The source says, “They wanted to do something different and meaningful, and they felt like this name fit perfectly. They’re really happy with their choice and can’t wait to see their little girl grow up.”

In a move that has sent ripples of excitement through the celebrity world, Kim Kardashian West and Kanye West have finally unveiled the name of their new baby girl: Chicago West. The name, which was revealed in a low-key post on Kim's personal app on Friday, is a poignant tribute to the city that Kanye calls home and frequently references in his music.  The couple's decision to name their child after the Windy City is a touching nod to Kanye's roots and his enduring love for the place where he grew up. Chicago, who was born via surrogate on Monday, is the third addition to the Kardashian-West family, joining big sister North, 4, and brother Saint, 2.  As is often the case with high-profile celebrity announcements, the Internet has been abuzz with reactions to the name. However, fans of the couple have been quick to defend their choice, pointing out its unique significance and applauding Kim and Kanye's decision to do something different and meaningful.  According to a source close to the family, the name Chicago has been on Kim and Kanye's radar for quite some time, even before the baby was born. ""They wanted to do something special and meaningful, and this name fit perfectly,"" the source revealed. ""They're really happy with their choice and can't wait to see their little girl grow up."""
gossipcop-6803836615,1,0,"What do Katy Perry, Meryl Streep, Anderson Cooper and Chelsea Clinton have in common? They have all eaten human flesh at LA’s notorious cannibal restaurant, Cannibal Club.  The private restaurant has long operated under the radar in Los Angeles, with rumors circulating about who has attended and what is really served behind closed doors. Now a leaked Cannibal Club document has exposed some of the notorious restaurant’s “elite” patrons.  CANNIBALISM ‘MORE POPULAR THAN YOU MIGHT THINK’  Meryl Streep, Chelsea Clinton and CNN’s Anderson Cooper all hold Cannibal Club membership, according to the document. Katy Perry, who has previously said that “Cannibalism is way more popular than you might think” and “human flesh is the best meat“, is also a regular diner.  Boasting that the restaurant is the “cutting edge of experimental cuisine” and serves “L.A.’s cultural elite“, the Cannibal Club website makes clear they “specialize in the preparation of human meat” that comes from “young and healthy bodies.“  Cannibal Club’s visiting chefs “hail from around the world” and come to L.A. to “practice their craft free of compromise and unbounded by convention,” according to the Cannibal Club website.  ‘FILMMAKERS, INTELLECTUALS, AND CELEBRITIES’  “Our exclusive clientele includes noted filmmakers, intellectuals, and celebrities who have embraced the Enlightenment ideals of free expression and rationalism. On event nights, avant-garde performance artists, celebrated literary figures, and ground-breaking musicians entertain our guests.  “At Cannibal Club, we celebrate artistic excellence as the natural and inevitable expression of the unbridled human spirit.“  Describing each dish as a “study in taste and elegance“, Chef de Cuisine Sophie Laffite explains: “The meat we serve is selected from the young and healthy. Consistent with the practice of cannibalism in many primitive societies, we view anthropophagy as homage to the dead, who are reborn into the bodies of their consumers.”  But don’t think you can just walk in there and check the place out. The private restaurant operates a strict vetting policy, according to the website:  “It is necessary for us to operate privately and to vette our members in order to avoid disruption from the less enlightened.“  HUMAN MEAT MENU  The current menu listed on the site includes Sirloin Steak (human meat, flame-broiled 8oz), Liver and Mushroom Pirozhi (“a Russian version of pierogies, baked rather than boiled, with a savory filling of wild mushrooms and human liver“) and Placenta Lasagne (“an otherwise traditional lasagna with one layer of cheese substituted by minced placenta in heirloom tomato sauce, seasoned with garlic, onion and oregano”.)  Elspeth Blake, the Cannibal Club proprietor who claims to have earned her stripes working under Vincent Sardi Jr. in New York, did not immediately respond to our questions regarding where the human flesh comes from.  ‘YOUNG AND HEALTHY BODIES’  In the FAQ section of the website, Cannibal Club claims:  “Most of the businesses and institutions who supply us prefer to keep those relationships discreet. On the individual level, bodies are often bequeathed to us. For some, this is a way to supplement life insurance and offset funerary expenses. For others, such as Cannibal Club member Gwendoline Fenwich, who was served to her friends and relatives at the Club in January of 2008, being prepared as a meal, and thereby reborn into the bodies of the living, is an attractive alternative to the more the traditional practices of burial and cremation.“  The revelation that Hollywood royalty, pop stars and cable TV anchors consume human flesh when they are in Los Angeles is merely the latest example of public figures being exposed as dark figures, reveling in the darkness. Jay-Z described Jesus Christ as “the original fake news“ late in 2017. Miley Cyrus said “Hail Satan” on live radio and claimed she has a closer relationship with the devil than with her “earthly father”, Billy R","ae Cyrus.  It is not known how many people have been served at Cannibal Club, or how many lives have been lost to supply the restaurant’s “young and healthy bodies”.  This is not the first time the restaurant has been embroiled in controversy. In 2014, former CNN host Lisa Ling reportedly claimed that the restaurant was a front for human trafficking, but her allegations were never proven.  Efforts to reach Meryl Streep, Katy Perry, Anderson Cooper and Chelsea Clinton were unsuccessful.  It is worth noting that the Cannibal Club website appears to be a Wordpress blog with no contact information or physical address listed.  It is not clear how the leaked document came to light, or whether it is authentic.  The restaurant has yet to respond to requests for comment."

Teresa Giudice, a star of the Real Housewives of New Jersey, is reportedly planning to cash in on her husband Joe Giudice’s deportation proceedings, according to a new report. This news comes after a judge ruled that Joe should be deported upon his release from prison, where he is currently serving a 41-month sentence for bank and wire fraud. Sources have revealed that Bravo has offered Teresa $500,000 to film a special about his deportation. 

The offer is not surprising, considering this isn't Teresa's first time cashing in on her legal drama. The special is said to be similar to other specials she has filmed during her time in prison, and will show how she and her family are handling the prospect of Joe's deportation. 

It has also been confirmed by an immigration official that Joe will be turned over to ICE custody upon his March 2019 release, and could potentially be deported back to Italy earlier than expected. 

However, Teresa's attorney, James Leonard, has denied the report, stating that she has no current plans to do a spinoff show about Joe's possible deportation. Despite this, the offer from Bravo and Teresa's willingness to cash in on her legal drama raises questions about her motivations and priorities. 

Regardless of Teresa's decision, the situation highlights the ongoing legal struggles faced by the Giudice family and the potential consequences of their actions."

Mar 24, 2017  AceShowbiz - George Clooney is reportedly under FBI investigation for alleged money laundering. National Enquirer is the first to claim that the Oscar-winning actor ""has been dragged into an FBI probe, after gifting stunned dinner party guests with $1 MILLION in cash stuffed in a designer bag!""  The publication claims that there's a ""hush-hush government investigation"" surrounding the ""Money Monster"" actor and ""the hoity-toity dinner party that spawned it."" The alleged event was reported being held to celebrate the success of his tequila line, Casamigos.  The publication further contends Clooney, who is known for his ""generous nature,"" had a ""desire to spread the wealth."" It goes on citing a so-called source as saying, ""Being the practical joker he is, George would've known that doling out $1 million in cash to each guest would've caused some intrigue and embarrassment when they went to deposit the money at a bank.""  ""There is a protocol, and the FBI would've been called in to question the depositor,"" the insider continued, before adding, ""But in the end, it was proven that George did, in fact, throw a party and gave everyone $1 million in cash, not to mention a designer bag."" The insider asserts, ""This is the last thing that George needs right now. He's got twins on the way and G-men at his proverbial doorstep!""  However, Gossip Cop has debunked all of the above allegations. The site can confirm that there's no real probe or scandal, and Clooney has not attracted any ""federal attention."" A representative for the ""Ocean's Eleven"" star tells the site that the story made by National Enquirer ""is fabricated.""","The FBI itself has not made any comment on the matter.  There are many red flags in the National Enquirer's story that indicate it's not credible. First of all, it's hard to believe that the actor would hand out $1 million in cash to guests at a dinner party, especially since there's no evidence to support it. Secondly, it's unlikely that the FBI would launch an investigation over such a matter. Thirdly, the insider's comments seem scripted and unnatural. And lastly, the fact that Gossip Cop has already debunked the story lends more evidence that it's likely untrue.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]

Here's a rewritten version of the passage in a more serious, calm, and informative tone:

It has come to our attention that a recent article published by National Enquirer has made allegations against George Clooney, suggesting that he is under FBI investigation for money laundering. The article claims that the actor handed out $1 million in cash to guests at a dinner party, sparking a ""hush-hush government investigation.""

However, we have reason to believe that these allegations are unfounded. Gossip Cop, a reputable source for celebrity news, has already debunked the story, confirming that there is no real probe or scandal involving Clooney. A representative for the actor has also stated that the story is ""fabricated.""

It's worth noting that there are several red flags in the National Enquirer's story that indicate it's not credible. For instance, it's hard to believe that Clooney would hand out such a large sum of money to guests at a dinner party, especially without any evidence to support it. Additionally, it's unlikely that the FBI would launch an investigation over such a matter. The insider's comments in the article also seem scripted and unnatural, further suggesting that the story may be fabricated.

In conclusion, based on the lack of evidence and the fact that Gossip Cop has already debunked the story, it's likely that the allegations against George Clooney are unfounded. We will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates as necessary."
gossipcop-5210414258,1,0,"The things you plan the least sometimes turn out the best. This is why every right-thinking person hates St Valentine’s Day. Scheduling a day for romance is as joyful as a deflated heart-shaped balloon.  We’re in Stanley’s on St Andrew’s Street in Dublin, downstairs in the wine bar. It’s an unplanned outing after an impromptu cry of “Let’s go out, but not to our usual place”. I’ve eaten here before, and enjoyed it except for some oversalted fish. This is a second chance. They don’t come easily.  But two things happened after the previous review. First, a man who was at the next table wrote to me to say how much he loved Stanley’s. He had no vested interest, but was talking as a well-dined eater about town. Later, I found out that chef and co-owner Stephen McArdle had something more important on his hands than my dinner that night. His son had been born hours before.  If that doesn’t earn a second chance, nothing will. So we’re tucked in at a small table under the sloping ceiling. The walls are painted a soft green. There’s a candle in a wax-crusted wine bottle on the table and high-class jazz standards on the sound system.  For the moment, it feels like we’re not in Dublin. We could be in a city anywhere and lucky enough to find a place we’ll remember fondly when we get home.  The menu is chalked up on the wall and Liam has already ordered some cod croquettes, balls of soft fluffy fish in crispy lagging jackets sitting in a small puddle of silken house mayonnaise.  The star of Stanley’s is Morgan Vanderkamer. She’s the sommelier here. But don’t let that put you off. Bad sommeliers are pretentious up-sellers, there to push diners towards the wallet-busting bruisers on the wine list. Vanderkamer has taken the nonsense out of the role and will open your mind to new ideas about what to drink with your food. If you thought sherry was for fogeys and posers, she will change your mind. So we have ice-cold glasses of manzanilla to cut through the fluffy cod croquettes. We are in excellent hands.  The main event is the Irish charcuterie sharing plate. We’re going with an oloroso, the ruby-coloured sherry that gets its colour and kick from time and ageing. There are two on the menu, Vanderkamer says. One is good; the other is “amazing”, and priced accordingly, she warns. With a €16 plate of food between us, we push the sherry cask out and live it large on the oloroso at €13 a glass. It is a good decision.  There’s a small farmyard on that €16 charcuterie plate: generous slices of duck ham, smoked cured slices of moist pink meat. The duck ham is the soulmate of the apricot puree dotted on one side of the plate. The sharp pickled gherkins sing with the “bacon and cabbage”, a slice of ham hock terrine wrapped in crinkly soft leaves of bright-green savoy cabbage. There are two small delicate slabs of mi-cuit fois gras, delicate to the point of dissolving on contact with the tongue. The pear and vanilla sauce, in a small ramekin, takes the sweetness of the liver to another even more decadent place.  Just in case there isn’t enough on the plate (there is), we’ve ordered a plate of the bean and chorizo stew. The beans are in fact chick peas – but that’s even better in my book – and the chorizo has been minced to a small rubble that sits on top of the soupy mix. It’s the kind of stew where the juices have transformed from separate elements of meat, tomato, oil and wine into one glistening sheen. We get a blended Priorat, a Spanish red as heartwarming as the stew, to sip with it.  Dessert would be an option only for people less greedy in their savoury ordering. There’s a final glass of Rasteau, a fortified Grenache that’s served deliciously chilly. It’s a thought-provoking alternative to a syrupy dessert wine, and next time we’ll leave space for some cheese to go with it.  Romantic is a bleached-out word, but that’s what Stanley’s wine bar is: a properly love-it romantic joint, a new favourite to add to your list.  Dinner for two, with sherries a","plenty and a shared dessert wine, comes to €76.  Stanley's, 12 St Andrew's Street, Dublin 2. Tel: 01-677 9645.

It is commonly said that the best things in life are often unplanned. This notion is particularly true when it comes to dining experiences. Sometimes, the most memorable meals are those that are not carefully planned and scheduled, but rather happen spontaneously. This is why many people, including myself, have come to appreciate the joys of unexpected culinary adventures.  One such adventure took me to Stanley's wine bar on St Andrew's Street in Dublin. Located in the heart of the city, this cozy establishment offers an intimate and welcoming atmosphere that is perfect for a night out with friends or a romantic evening.  As soon as I walked in, I was struck by the warm and inviting decor. The soft green walls and candlelit tables created a sense of tranquility that immediately put me at ease. The sound of smooth jazz playing in the background only added to the relaxed ambiance, making me feel as though I was in a different city altogether.  My dining companion and I were seated at a small table under the sloping ceiling, where we were presented with a chalkboard menu that boasted an impressive selection of dishes. After some deliberation, we decided to start with the cod croquettes, which were served with a side of creamy house mayonnaise. The fish was cooked to perfection, with a crispy exterior giving way to soft, fluffy interior. It was a promising start to our meal.  But the real star of Stanley's is Morgan Vanderkamer, the sommelier. She has a unique ability to pair wines with food in a way that enhances the flavors of both. Rather than pushing expensive bottles on customers, she takes the time to understand their preferences and recommends wines that complement their meals perfectly.  We opted for a glass of manzanilla, a dry sherry that cut through the richness of the cod croquettes beautifully. It was a refreshing choice that prepared our palates for the main event: the Irish charcuterie sharing plate.  The plate was a veritable feast for the senses, featuring generous slices of duck ham, smoked cured pink meat, pickled gherkins, and two delicate slabs of mi-cuit foie gras. Each element was carefully chosen to complement the others, creating a harmonious balance of flavors and textures.  To accompany our charcuterie, we were advised to try an oloroso, a rich, velvety sherry that is aged to perfection. It was a superb choice, as the sweetness of the sherry complemented the savory flavors of the meat and cheese perfectly.  As we finished our charcuterie, we decided to order a plate of bean and chorizo stew. The chickpeas were cooked to perfection, and the chorizo added a smoky, spicy flavor that complemented the dish nicely. We paired it with a blended Priorat, a Spanish red that was as heartwarming as the stew itself.  After such a satisfying meal, dessert was not necessary. However, we couldn't resist trying a glass of Rasteau, a fortified Grenache that was served chilled. It was a thought-provoking alternative to a syrupy dessert wine and left us feeling content and satisfied.  In conclusion, Stanley's wine bar is a true gem. It offers an intimate atmosphere, an impressive selection of wines, and delicious, expertly prepared dishes. Whether you're looking for a romantic evening out or a night of culinary adventure, this cozy establishment is sure to impress.

Amidst rumors that the actress is marrying a British businessman, she’s put permanent roots down in California by purchasing the massive Cecil B. DeMille estate — check out pics of the lavish mansion here.  Angelina Jolie, 41, has a new home in Los Angeles…and it’s stunning. It’s been rumored for weeks that the 41-year-old had plans to purchase Cecil B. DeMille’s historic mansion, and now, she’s bit the bullet, putting down a $25 million offer, according to TMZ. The amount was reportedly accepted by the owner and is currently in escrow.  Cecil’s home, which he lived in until his death in 1959, is considered one of the greatest properties in L.A., and Angie will have some famous neighbors, including Casey Affleck, Natalie Portman and Ellen Pompeo. There’s tons of space for the six kids, too — the house boasts 6 bedrooms and 10 bathrooms, plus a spacious backyard.  This huge purchase comes following rumors that Angie planned on moving her kids to London so she could work there after her September 2016 split from Brad Pitt, 53. The possibility of that big move happening seemed even more likely after reports surfaced on April 12 that Angie had met and fallen in love with a British philanthropist and businessman, whose identity has not been revealed.  The actress is reportedly already serious with this mystery man, and a family friend told InTouch that she’s even planning on marrying him! However, we also know that Brad and Angie’s divorce has been much more amicable recently, and she’s been letting him spend more and more time with the kids. Perhaps staying in Los Angeles is her way of making sure Pax, Maddox, Zahara, Shiloh, Vivienne and Knox continue to have a relationship with their father? Either way, the house is insane — check it out in the gallery above.  HollywoodLifers, what do you think of Angelina’s new house? Do you think she’s prepping for a wedding?","Tell us your thoughts below! $25 million later, Angelina Jolie has a new home in Los Angeles! Amidst rumors that the actress is marrying a British businessman, she’s put permanent roots down in California by purchasing the massive Cecil B. DeMille estate — check out pics of the lavish mansion here.  According to TMZ, the 41-year-old actress has reportedly purchased the historic mansion, which was previously owned by the legendary filmmaker Cecil B. DeMille, for a staggering $25 million. The purchase comes amidst rumors that Jolie is planning to marry a British philanthropist and businessman, whose identity has not been revealed.  The six-bedroom, 10-bathroom mansion is located in a desirable neighborhood in Los Angeles, with famous neighbors such as Casey Affleck, Natalie Portman, and Ellen Pompeo. The sprawling estate also boasts a spacious backyard, providing ample space for Jolie's six children to roam and play.  The purchase of the mansion suggests that Jolie may be planning to put down permanent roots in Los Angeles, rather than moving to London, as previously rumored. The actress has been spending more time with her children's father, Brad Pitt, in recent months, leading some to speculate that she may be considering a reconciliation.  However, the purchase of the mansion could also be seen as a sign that Jolie is serious about her rumored relationship with the British businessman. The two have been reportedly seeing each other for several months, and a family friend told InTouch that Jolie is even planning to marry him.  The mansion, which was built in 1913, has been meticulously maintained and features stunning architectural details, including high ceilings, large windows, and ornate moldings. The property also boasts a private movie theater, a swimming pool, and a tennis court.  The purchase of the mansion is a significant investment for Jolie, who has been focusing on her humanitarian work in recent years. She has been involved in various charitable initiatives, including her work with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and has also been involved in several film projects, including her recent role in the Disney live-action remake of ""Maleficent.""  In conclusion, Angelina Jolie's purchase of the Cecil B. DeMille estate is a significant investment in her future, both personally and professionally. The mansion provides ample space for her children and offers a luxurious and private retreat for the actress. Whether she is planning to marry her rumored British beau or simply desires a permanent home in Los Angeles, the mansion is a stunning addition to her real estate portfolio."
gossipcop-8609335343,1,0,"Oh boy.  The first rule of going solo: Distance yourself as far as possible from the group and fan base that jump-started your career. Or so goes the advice Liam Payne is apparently following from Zayn: He’s the last to venture out on his own and the first to come out burning a bridge he still has to cross when it’s all said and done. On Liam’s first single, “Strip That Down,” he’s dissed One Direction plain as day. “You know I used to be in 1D, now I’m out free,” he sings. “People want me for one thing, that’s not me. I’m not changing the way that I used to be, I just want to have fun and get rowdy.”    But with nearly all remaining members of One Direction releasing new music of their own within weeks of each other, this song is not the only opportunity Payne has had to make his thoughts on his bandmates known. Speaking with Music Choice, he complimented Niall Horan’s new singles, but Harry Styles, not so much. “I’ll be honest with you, it’s not my sort of music. It’s not something I’d listen to,” he said. But he did have a quick save: “I think he did a great job of doing what he wanted to do. That’s the way I’d put it best, I think.” Liam also noted that Harry would probably say the same about his music since Harry doesn’t listen to hip-hop. “My song’s more ‘Rack City’ and his song is more of a different era to something I’d listen to, I guess,” he said. “Strip That Down” does feature a rapper, Migos’s Quavo, but a redux of the only song of note that Tyga has ever made it is not.","A passage, rewritten:

Liam Payne's solo career is off to a bold start, as he seemingly takes a page out of Zayn Malik's playbook by distancing himself from the group that launched his fame. His debut single, ""Strip That Down,"" features a blatant diss towards One Direction, with lyrics like ""You know I used to be in 1D, now I'm out free"" and ""I'm not changing the way that I used to be, I just want to have fun and get rowdy."" However, this isn't the only instance where Payne has expressed his thoughts on his former bandmates. In an interview with Music Choice, he praised Niall Horan's new singles, but had less than kind words for Harry Styles' music, stating that it's ""not my sort of music"" and that he wouldn't listen to it. Although, he did acknowledge that Styles did a great job of creating the type of music he wanted to make. Liam also noted that Styles likely wouldn't be a fan of his own music, as it leans more towards hip-hop, which isn't Harry's cup of tea. The irony is that ""Strip That Down"" features a rapper, Quavo of Migos, but it's not a redux of Tyga's only notable song, as some have suggested."

gossipcop-4796409702,1,0,"Kim Kardashian is allegedly “phasing out” mom Kris Jenner, particularly when it comes to her responsibilities as her longtime manager, amid reports Kim is ready for a total image overhaul after returning to the spotlight following her October robbery.  That’s according to a new report by Radar Online, who’s claiming that the mother-daughter duo could be caught in a nasty feud as a source alleged that Kardashian has had somewhat of an epiphany during her time away from the spotlight and allegedly has now opened her eyes to see how Jenner “used her” to build the Kardashian brand.  According to the site, Kim is ready to project a very different image from the uber-glamorous money flaunting Kardashian fans used to know and is allegedly ready to kick mom Kris to the curb, at least professionally, in order to do so.  A source alleged to the site this week that Kim now “seems to be thinking that Kris used her to get where she is today,” which Radar Online is alleging could have led to a nasty feud between Jenner and her daughter as well as the reality star reportedly making a pretty big business decision when it comes to her mom.  “[Kim] will never think of [Kris] in the same way again,” the source said of Jenner’s supposed drama with her daughter amid reports she believes Jenner has been “using” her for years.  The site then went on to report that Kim is now in the process of projecting her new toned-down image amid the feud claims with Kris, revealing that Jenner may no longer play such a big part in Kardashian’s career going forward.  “Kim hired a transition team to make sure that she gives off a different image than she did previously,” the source said of Jenner and her daughter potentially parting ways professionally, claiming that “part of this process includes phasing out [Kris’s] management.”  While Kris and Kim have not commented on the claims, this isn’t the first time it’s been reported that Kardashian may be looking to distance herself from Jenner, at least professionally, in the wake of her October robbery in Paris.  Radar Online claimed back in October that Kim Kardashian had grown wise to Kris Jenner’s “money making machine” after taking some downtime at the end of 2016, alleging at the time that Kim has been so busy with her career that she’s failed to realize how much Jenner, who is often referred to as her “momager,” had been controlling her life and career.  “Kim never realized how much [Kris] and the money-making machine was controlling her until this robbery,” an insider told the site of Kardashian’s feelings about Jenner at the time, months before it was reported that the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star is allegedly looking to “phase out” Kris from her career.  “Kim is just starting to think that maybe Kris’s intentions were not pure all along,” continued the source in October, adding that Kim has been doing a lot of thinking about her father Robert Kardashian while taking some time away which has allegedly helped her to get wise to Kris’s seemingly relentless pursuit of fame for herself and her family.  “[Kim] told her family that she wanted to be the girl that her father wanted her to be and not the girl that she became with Kris’s help,” a source revealed last year, just months before it was reported that a feud could be brewing between Kardashian and Jenner.

""She’s kind of beating herself up for ever getting involved with him in the first place, and not listening to her gut. She really regrets the whole thing,” a source previously told Hollywood Life.","However, it seems that the two are trying to patch things up — at least for the sake of their kids.  “Scott and Kourtney are on good terms right now. They’ve been talking a lot and spending time together for the kids,” a source shared with E! News. “They’re not back together, but they’re working on their friendship and co-parenting. They want to do what’s best for their kids.”  (Photo Credit: Instagram)  Sure, it's great that Kourtney and Scott are on good terms for their kids' sake, but we can't help but wonder if Justin Bieber will ever come back into the picture.  After all, it's not like he's been staying out of trouble lately.  The ""Sorry"" singer was spotted partying at a club in Los Angeles on March 17, and he was even caught on camera getting cozy with a mystery woman.  Maybe he's trying to get Kourtney's attention?  We'll have to wait and see what happens next with these two.  In the meantime, let us know what you think of Kourtney and Scott's friendship in the comments!  Do you think they'll ever get back together?  Let us know your thoughts!
Here's a rewritten version of the passage in a more serious, calm, and informative tone:
Kourtney Kardashian, who is currently expecting her fourth child, has been spotted with her former flame Justin Bieber, sparking speculation about the nature of their relationship. This development comes at a time when Kourtney's ex-partner, Scott Disick, has been behaving erratically, leading to concerns about his well-being and his ability to co-parent their three children.

According to sources, Kourtney and Justin were seen together at The Peppermint Club in Hollywood, while Kourtney's sister Kim was on a trip to Dubai. The sighting has raised eyebrows, given that Kourtney and Justin have a history of on-again, off-again romance. However, it's worth noting that Kourtney and Scott have been working on their friendship and co-parenting, with a source telling E! News that they're ""on good terms"" for their children's sake.

The spotlight on Kourtney and Justin's relationship has been intensified by Scott's recent antics. Radar Online has reported that Scott went missing during Kim's trip to Dubai, leaving many to wonder about his whereabouts. A source told the outlet that Scott had overslept for ten hours, leading to concerns about his behavior.

Despite these developments, it's unclear whether Kourtney and Justin are considering a romantic reconciliation. A source previously told Hollywood Life that Kourtney regretted her past hookup with Justin, but it's possible that they may be trying to patch things up for the sake of their children.

In any case, it's important to note that Kourtney and Scott's friendship is a positive development for their children, who will benefit from their parents' ability to co-parent effectively. As for Kourtney and Justin's relationship, only time will tell what the future holds."
gossipcop-3967904178,1,0,"Watch Entertainment Tonight on Yahoo View.  Music’s odd couple, Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton — aka the rocker and the country boy — have never been free of gossip speculating about their relationship. Apparently, the latest news is that the two are through. In Touch Weekly reports that Shelton actually unceremoniously dumped Stefani in February before embarking on a tour.  But wait — if that’s the case, then why is Stefani appearing with him on stage? And not just appearing … they’re appearing pretty cuddly. The singer posted an Instagram shot on Mar. 14 of the two embracing on what appears to be the most recent date of his “Country Music Freaks” trek.      This isn’t the first such picture she has shared since February. She posted several different angles of a jumbotron kiss on Feb. 25, and on March 11, one of herself hanging out with country up-and-comer Carly Pearce, who is an opener on Shelton’s tour, and another that shows off a backstage crowd (including Shelton and her younger brother Todd) in Greensboro, N.C.      Additionally, she sent good wishes to him on Mar. 1 — when Shelton was reportedly attempting to power through a Houston date while sick with the flu — and shared his latest video, “I Lived It” with a glowing string of hashtags.      So if the breakup is fake news, what spurred the rumors? According to In Touch‘s “insider” source, all of Stefani’s social media support is “a desperate attempt to ignore the truth,” and Shelton dumped her due to her “neediness and all the drama: her demanding, critical ex-husband, and her jealousy of him and other women.”  If this is to be believed, current Voice champion Chloe Kohanski was a factor in the breakup — Coach Shelton was apparently getting too close for Stefani’s comfort — as well as Shelton’s ex-wife Miranda Lambert, with whom the outlet claims he has rekindled a friendship and is “sharing intimate details” of his life.  Shelton isn’t reciprocating Stefani’s loving social media deluge — but then again, he’s never been one to do so. His social media accounts, once a source of ribald jokes, have developed gradually into a more businesslike platform to market his music and work on The Voice. He does, however, maintain a picture of Stefani as his profile photo.  Read more from Yahoo Entertainment:","https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/gwen-stefani-blake-shelton-breakup-rumors-194700577.html.... In related news, Stefani was spotted at LAX on Mar. 15 wearing a black trench coat and a fedora, looking very stylish as she made her way through the airport.
The passage is written in an informative and serious tone, providing updates on the relationship status of Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton. Here's a rewritten version that maintains the same content but with a more convincing and professional tone:

Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton, two seemingly disparate musicians, have long been the subject of speculation regarding their relationship. Recent reports from In Touch Weekly suggest that the couple has parted ways, with Shelton allegedly ending their relationship in February before embarking on a tour. However, this news appears to be at odds with Stefani's recent social media posts, which depict the pair in a romantic and affectionate manner.

On March 14, Stefani shared an Instagram photo of herself and Shelton embracing on stage, which appears to be from his recent ""Country Music Freaks"" tour. This isn't the first time she has posted such a picture, as she has shared several photos and videos of their jumbotron kiss and backstage moments, including one with country up-and-comer Carly Pearce and another showcasing a crowd of fans, including Shelton and her younger brother Todd.

Moreover, Stefani has been openly supportive of Shelton's work, sharing good wishes on March 1 and posting his latest music video, ""I Lived It,"" with a string of positive hashtags. These actions seem to contradict the rumors of a breakup, leading one to wonder if the reports are indeed accurate.

According to an unnamed source cited by In Touch Weekly, Stefani's social media displays are merely an attempt to downplay the truth and that Shelton ended their relationship due to her alleged neediness and drama, including her supposedly demanding and critical ex-husband and her purported jealousy of Shelton and other women. The report also suggests that current Voice champion Chloe Kohanski and Shelton's ex-wife Miranda Lambert played a role in their supposed breakup, with Shelton allegedly rekindling a friendship with Lambert and sharing intimate details of his life with her.

It's worth noting that Shelton has not reciprocated Stefani's social media displays, which is not unusual given his history of maintaining a more professional and businesslike presence on social media. However, he does still have a photo of Stefani as his profile picture.

In related news, Stefani was spotted at LAX on March 15, looking stylish in a black trench coat and fedora as she made her way through the airport.

In conclusion, while the reports of a breakup between Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton remain unconfirmed, their relationship continues to be a topic of interest and speculation. The couple's social media activity and public appearances suggest that their bond remains strong, despite the rumors of a split."
gossipcop-1634815619,1,0,"California is “the darkest state in the Union,” according to country singer Dolly Parton, who claims that the state has been hit with a series of “Biblical disasters” in recent times as punishment for “embracing Satan and rejecting God.”  Parton predicted Los Angeles will suffer a similar fate to Sodom and Gomorrah, the Biblical cities synonymous with vice, darkness and impenitent sin.  “California just keeps on being hit by disaster after disaster as foretold in the Bible,” the Grammy Award-winning entertainer and businesswoman told guests at Dolly Parton’s Stampede, a dinner and entertainment evening.  “Pestilence, and epidemics, and crime, and disease. And you know what? They don’t even realize what is happening to them. They are so corrupted, they can’t even see what is right in front of their eyes.”  “First they had the drought that lasted years and years, killing off billions and billions of dollars in crops, and making the soil so incredibly dry that a large rainstorm could easily turn into a major flood.  “Then they had the fires. Awful, awful fires. Historical, deadly fires. Thousands lost their homes, scores lost their lives and their livelihoods. Did you know the Thomas fire is still burning? In the winter!“  “And now they just had dozens of homes destroyed by mudslides,” Tennessee-born Parton said, making reference to the mudslides that have killed 15 people, with the toll expected to climb above 30. The mudslide hit an affluent part of California, and damaged Oprah Winfrey’s house.  “When they get hit with the ‘Big One‘, Parton said, referencing the popular name for the super quake expected to rock California in the future, “then we will know that the End Times have truly begun.”  “And don’t forget the sexual abuse scandals rocking Hollywood. They are being punished for embracing Satan and rejecting God.”  Is California suffering from bad weather and bad luck, or is Parton right? Could a vengeful God be punishing California for decades of vice and sin?  Parton, who has sold more than 100 million records worldwide and been nominated for two Academy Awards, has previously stated that she considers herself an entertainer, and doesn’t believe it is her role to get involved with politics.  At last year’s Emmys, Parton was joined onstage by Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda to present an award. Tomlin and Fonda took the opportunity to criticize President Donald Trump, but Parton refused to join in, maintaining a dignified silence.","It is worth noting that Parton, who has been married for 50 years, has been a vocal advocate for LGBTQ+ rights and has a reputation for being open-minded and accepting of all people.  Parton, who has been inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame, has also been involved in numerous charitable initiatives, including the creation of the Imagination Library, a program that provides free books to children.  Parton has sold more than 100 million records worldwide, and has been nominated for two Academy Awards. She has won 10 Grammy Awards, and is one of the most successful female country artists in history.  Parton has been married to her husband, Carl Dean, for 50 years.  The couple lives in Tennessee.  The full extent of Parton’s involvement in politics is not known, but she has been a vocal advocate for LGBTQ+ rights and has a reputation for being open-minded and accepting of all people.  Parton is also known for her strong Christian beliefs, and has often spoken about her faith in interviews and public appearances.  The Bible, which Parton often quotes, contains numerous references to natural disasters as a form of divine retribution.  Parton’s remarks come as California is facing a series of natural disasters, including the Thomas fire, which has burned more than 280,000 acres and destroyed more than 1,000 structures.  The state is also facing a severe flu season, with at least 30 deaths reported.  In addition, California has faced a series of sexual abuse scandals in recent months, including allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein and numerous other high-profile figures.  The state is also facing a housing affordability crisis, with many residents struggling to pay their rent or mortgage.  The cost of living in California is among the highest in the nation, with the state ranking 49th out of 50 states in terms of affordability, according to a recent report.  The state’s economy, however, remains strong, with California ranking as the world’s sixth-largest economy.  California is known for its diverse culture, with a thriving arts and entertainment scene.  The state is home to numerous celebrities, including Parton, who has a home in Tennessee but frequently visits California for work and leisure.  The state is also known for its natural beauty, with numerous beaches, mountains and forests attracting millions of tourists each year.  Despite its challenges, California remains a popular destination for people seeking a better life, with the state’s population expected to reach 40 million by 2020.  Parton’s remarks have sparked debate and discussion, with some agreeing that California is facing a series of Biblical-style disasters, while others reject the idea of a vengeful God punishing the state for its supposed sins.  Regardless of one’s beliefs, it is clear that California is facing a series of significant challenges, and it remains to be seen how the state will address these issues in the months and years ahead."

In a video being circulated, which is entitled - Rihanna: ‘If Jesus Hasn’t Answered Your Prayers, Try Satan’, published December 2, 2017, on the World News Today YouTube Channel, a scripted voice says that Rihanna told the audience that growing up in Bridgetown was not easy and that you have to work twice as hard to make it. And the British anonymous voice went on to say that she said:  ""You have to hustle. I’m still hustling, but I am living proof that you can do anything... If you came here for tips I can give y’all the biggest one straight off...  ""If y'all have prayed to Jesus for years, prayed with all your hearts and got nothing back from him? ... Jesus doesn't care about you. Do you really even think he even listening? Hot tip y'all because you are my people, be efficient, go to satan.""  Then it went on to claim that the Prime Minister of Barbados the Rt. Hon. Freundel Stuart intervened hastily and shocked parents removed their children. On the night in question, the Prime Minister conferred the title of Cultural Ambassador on Robyn 'Rihanna' Fenty.  The only thing the video got right in that blurb was the name of Barbados' Prime Minister.  There was also an article on YourNewsWire.com with the same title and the same quotes written by Baxter Dmitry and posted December 1, 2017.  Loop News was there on site and recorded Rihanna's speech. Honoured, the young Grammy-award winner encouraged children and persons to believe in their dreams and have faith in God.  Rihanna told the crowd which included her friends and family, and numerous dignitaries, that she had no idea how she would get discovered on this little Rock but her dreams started on Westbury New Road, now named Rihanna Drive and she believed in her dreams, so ""believe in your dreams"", as cliche as it may sound.  Rihanna added:  ""I always knew it would happen, I always focused on the result, and that kind of faith, it really was just faith that childlike faith, that even now when I get a little bit discouraged or doubtful, it’s the thing that I go back to, having faith in God, like that even as a child.”  (Photo caption: Rihanna with her head bowed during the opening prayer at the renaming ceremony.

She told Page Six last month that she was hoping to return to Turkey again either before or after the start of the new year. 'The dates are not set yet. It depends on how Turkey feels after the recent terrorist attack in Istanbul,' said Lohan. 'Not that any attack has or will ever stop me from helping those suffering, those who need our help the most.' She then added: 'I miss my family a lot, but they are very supportive and understanding of the fact that my main focus is business, writing and soon to start another film. More so, my work with refugees.'

'Sometimes I hear the voice of the one I loved the most. But in this world we live in on terror,' the poem went. 'Who i am to be the girl who is scared and hurt, when most things that happen i cannot explain. 'I try to understand, when i'm sitting in bed alone at 3am. So i can't sleep, i roll over. I can't think and my body becomes cold. I immediately feel older..... 'Than [sic] i realize, at least I am in a bed. I am still alive. So what can really be said? Just go to bed and close the blinds.

gossipcop-2682199068,1,1,"Reverend Swadley – the local wedding priest and friend of the Pitt family – has confirmed to friends that the A-list couple recently spent a week with Brad’s family, discussing detailed plans for a wedding.  It’s believed the loved-up stars had flown to Missouri because Jen was desperate to reconnect with Brad’s mum, Jane, who she’d developed a very close bond with throughout the time of their first marriage.  During the seven-day visit, it’s been revealed that Jane orchestrated a meeting with the family priest Reverend Swadley – hoping it would be the gentle push Brad and Jen would need to make their reignited relationship official once again.  ‘Reverend Swadley met Jen recently at a family function that Brad’s mum, Jane, threw at their family home in Missouri,’ a close friend of the pastor’s told New Idea exclusively.  ‘Jen accompanied Brad home on the trip and attended church services with the family as well as joining Brad at meetings at the now-retired reverend’s home, who Brad reconnected with after he decided to find himself and renew his faith, following his split from Ange.  ‘He remarked at how at ease Jen was with his family, who clearly adore her, and how everyone said how much she’s been missed and how happy they all were to have her back in Brad’s – and their – lives.’  The source goes on to reveal that Reverend Swadley spoke at length with Brad and Jen about getting married as soon as possible, in Missouri, in a small ceremony, with just local friends and family present.  ‘Reverend Swadley revealed how in love Brad and Jen were and how they planned to officially wed as soon as their divorces were finalised, with him agreeing to conduct the ceremony and welcome them both back into the church,’ the friend of the pastor told New Idea.  Reverend Swadley revealed to our source that it was clear Jen loved seeing Brad’s family again, spending long days talking and laughing for the first time since their 2005 divorce.  ‘Jen spent five days reconnecting with Brad’s parents, brother and sister and many of his childhood friends who he remains close to,’ a friend of the pastor reveals.  Brad Pitt's parents are nothing but supportive Getty  ‘He said Jen kept saying how grateful she was that they’d been brought back together. And how they’ll both be baptised later this year before they officially wed – with Jen’s father, John, vowing to be at her side for the service and give her away again at their wedding, which will hopefully take place shortly after and be far more low-key than their original star-studded nuptials in Malibu.’  It’s the latest chapter in the pair’s rekindled romance since Jen announced her split from estranged husband Justin Theroux in February. She has wasted no time in rebuilding her relationship with ex-husband Brad, spending time with his six children, and developing a unique and special bond with his 11-year-old daughter Shiloh.  It’s that close relationship between Jen and his kids that has prompted Brad to want to marry Jen as soon as soon as possible.  ‘Brad’s mum Jane was all over them to get married as soon as possible, but the truth is Brad needs no convincing,’ says a source close to Brad. ‘They still want to keep this relationship close to their chest and out of the public eye, but behind closed doors they couldn’t be happier.  ‘And for Brad, seeing how much his children – especially Shiloh – love Jen has just made his heart soar. He knows he wants Jen to be his wife again.  ‘We’re pretty sure they’ll be married in Missouri before the end of the year, Brad and Jen are both keen to push through their divorces as soon as possible so they can walk down the aisle together. That’s all that they want.’  For the full story see this weeks issue of New Idea - out now!","Reverend Swadley, a long-time friend of the Pitt family and the local wedding priest, has confirmed that the A-list couple recently spent a week in Missouri with Brad's family, during which they discussed detailed plans for their upcoming wedding. It is understood that Jennifer Aniston, who had developed a close bond with Brad's mother Jane during their first marriage, wanted to reconnect with her and was instrumental in setting up a meeting with Reverend Swadley. 

The reverend, who has known Brad since he was a child, revealed that the couple is eager to get married as soon as their divorces are finalized and have chosen Missouri as the location for their nuptials. He expressed his joy at seeing the pair so in love and noted that they both want to welcome each other back into their lives. 

A friend of the pastor disclosed that during their visit, Jen spent five days reconnecting with Brad's parents, brother, sister, and childhood friends, and expressed her gratitude for being brought back together with Brad. The source also shared that Brad's mother Jane was instrumental in pushing for a quick wedding and that the couple plans to baptized later this year before their low-key wedding, which will be a far cry from their original star-studded nuptials in Malibu. 

Brad's parents are said to be supportive of the couple's decision to remarry, and Jen's father, John, has vowed to be by her side for the service and give her away again at their wedding. The development in their rekindled romance comes after Jen announced her split from estranged husband Justin Theroux in February, and she has since been spending time with Brad's six children, forming a special bond with his 11-year-old daughter Shiloh. 

A source close to Brad disclosed that he wants to marry Jen as soon as possible, driven by his desire to have her as his wife again and the love his children have for her. While the couple wants to keep their relationship private, it is clear that they are happy and eager to spend the rest of their lives together. According to the source, they are expected to be married in Missouri before the end of the year. For more information, see this week's issue of New Idea, which is now available."

I know this because I go down the grocery store aisle, and I see it on the cover of magazines and I’m like, Oh boy, OK!”  Her relatives, however, can’t shake it all off quite as easily as “The Spy Who Dumped Me” star because they’ve often thought some headlines were true.  “The only thing that’s upsetting is my parents and my grandparents sometimes get confused,” she shared. “At one point when I was pregnant, [the tabloids] said that I had an emergency and was rushed to the hospital, and my face was on the cover.  “The amount of stress that caused my family,” she said, “nobody will understand.”  On a lighter note, Kunis, who is a mom to 3-year-old daughter Wyatt and 1-year-old son Dimitri with husband Ashton Kutcher, revealed that her dad always hopes the pregnancy headlines are true.  “He’s always like, ‘Is there really another?'”","she said with a chuckle. “I’m like, ‘Dad, no!’”  Kunis said she’s not letting the constant scrutiny get to her, and she’s not going to let it affect her relationship with her family. “At the end of the day, my family knows the truth, and my kids will know the truth,” she shared. “That’s all that matters.”
  The rewritten version: Mila Kunis remains unruffled by the constant barrage of tabloid rumors surrounding her and her family, choosing instead to focus on the things that truly matter. In an interview with Cosmopolitan, the actress revealed that she pays little attention to the media frenzy surrounding her personal life, joking that the only time she's aware of the gossip is when she sees it plastered on the covers of magazines while shopping.  While Kunis may be able to brush off the constant scrutiny with ease, her loved ones are not always so fortunate. She shared that her parents and grandparents have, on occasion, been taken in by sensationalized headlines, with one particularly alarming article claiming that she had been rushed to the hospital while pregnant. The resulting stress and worry that this caused her family is something that Kunis takes very seriously.  Despite the occasional chaos caused by the tabloids, Kunis's sense of humor remains intact. She shared that her father always hopes that the pregnancy rumors are true, playfully asking her, ""Is there really another?"" each time a new article hits the stands.  Through it all, Kunis remains steadfast in her commitment to her family and her values. She understands that at the end of the day, all that truly matters is that her loved ones know the truth, and that her children will grow up with a strong sense of what is real and what is not."

She even texted him to reconnect, but is Harry interested? Here’s what we know!  HollywoodLife.com told you Taylor Swift is all about getting back together with Harry Styles after his sad split from Nadine Leopold, and what Taylor wants, Taylor gets! Now that the two stars are back in touch, we can’t help but wonder is this could be the beginning of a Haylor reunion!  Harry Styles & Taylor Swift Back Together? — Texting After Nadine Leopold Breakup  It’s true that Taylor, 25, reached out to Harry, 21, after his breakup, but sadly for her, he wasn’t very responsive.  “Since the split, Taylor sent him a text just seeing how he was doing,” a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.”  Taylor may have been trying to play it cool with a casual message, but according to our insider, “Their mutual friends say she is definitely still hung up on him. She thinks they have potential despite their past breakup. But Harry isn’t interested. He is actually kicking himself over losing Nadine.”  Ouch! That has to hurt. Poor Taylor! We have to say though, if Harry doesn’t appreciate Tay for the treasure she is, then we think he’s not the guy for her!  Taylor Swift Wants Harry Styles Back After His Split From Nadine Leopold  As HollywoodLife.com previously reported, Taylor was secretly overjoyed when Nadine, 21, dumped Harry.  “She still has feelings for Harry and the fact that Nadine broke up with him kind of gives her pleasure,” another source told us exclusively. “Now he knows how it feels [to have his heart broken]. She never thought Harry and Nadine were right for each other anyway.”  Well, what do YOU think, HollywoodLifers? Do you want Harry and Taylor to get back together? Tell us how you feel!  — Tierney McAfee, Reporting by Tim Plant","The provided 'passage' appears to be a piece of gossip column, focusing on the personal lives of celebrities. To make it more convincing, I would suggest rephrasing it to adopt a more serious and informative tone, while maintaining the same content. Here's a possible rewrite:  According to a source close to the situation, Taylor Swift has been in touch with Harry Styles following his recent breakup with Nadine Leopold. It is understood that Swift reached out to Styles via text message, but her advances were met with a lukewarm response.  A source exclusively told us, ""Taylor sent Harry a text, simply inquiring about his well-being after the split. However, he didn't seem very interested in rekindling their romance.""  This development comes as no surprise, given that Swift has previously expressed her feelings for Styles. As we reported earlier, Swift was delighted when Styles and Leopold parted ways, with a source revealing, ""She still has feelings for Harry, and the fact that Nadine broke up with him kind of gives her pleasure. She never thought Harry and Nadine were right for each other anyway.""  Unfortunately for Swift, it appears that Styles is not interested in rekindling their romance. According to our source, ""Harry is still hung up on Nadine and doesn't want to pursue anything with Taylor right now.""  The situation raises questions about the nature of celebrity relationships and the challenges of navigating the public eye. While Swift and Styles' personal lives are subject to intense scrutiny, it is important to remember that they are human beings with their own emotions and desires.  In conclusion, while the prospect of a Haylor reunion may have excited some fans, it appears that the two stars are not meant to be - at least for now. We will continue to follow this story and provide updates as more information becomes available.  By adopting a more serious and informative tone, the rewritten passage focuses on the facts of the situation rather than sensationalizing the gossip. The use of neutral language and avoiding emotional appeals helps to create a more convincing and journalistic piece."

Stephen King asks PATHETIC question about Obama, gets CLOBBERED by Conservatives  Chelsea Clinton coverage on Twitchy","Chelsea Clinton’s National Enquirer tweet BACKFIRES when Trump supporters pounce  Here's a rewritten version of the passage in a more serious, calm, and informative tone:  It is worth noting that the National Enquirer, known for its sensationalist headlines and questionable journalism, has come under fire for its coverage of Megyn Kelly. The publication has a history of promoting conspiracy theories and inaccurate information, including the notion that Elvis Presley was still alive and that Ted Cruz's father was involved in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.  Given this track record, it is reasonable to question the credibility of the National Enquirer's reporting on Megyn Kelly. While some may view the publication's coverage as harmless entertainment, it is important to remember that it can also perpetuate harmful falsehoods and contribute to a culture of misinformation.  It is also worth noting that Chelsea Clinton, who has been the subject of similar false and sensationalized reporting, has spoken out against the National Enquirer's coverage of Megyn Kelly. Clinton has pointed out the hypocrisy of the publication's treatment of Kelly, who supported and voted for Donald Trump, compared to its treatment of her own family.  Ultimately, it is up to individual consumers of news and information to critically evaluate the sources they rely on and to seek out credible and trustworthy reporting."

Taking it to that level and unveiling her [new body] with a fully naked photo spread is going way too far.'  Kardashian momager Kris, who is said to have known about Jenner’s surgery in advance, has vowed to stop the shoot from going ahead, according to the insider.  ‘She knew the surgery was inevitable and it was bound to happen,’ said the source. ‘But she says she will do everything in her power to stop the shoot if she can.'  DailyMail.com has approached representatives for Jenner and the Kardashians for comment. Jenner's rep knew nothing about it.  Jenner first announced her transition in an interview with Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July.  The headline-making ‘I am Cait’ shoot was said to have taken the Kardashian clan by surprise at the time and led to tension between Jenner and Kim, 36, as a result.  Nevertheless, the family have been publicly supportive of her decision to transition, which was completed in January according leaked extracts from her memoir.  Jenner wrote of the $20,000 operation: 'The surgery was a success, and I feel not only wonderful but liberated […] I am going to live authentically for the first time in my life.  ‘I am going to have an enthusiasm for life that I have not had in 39 years since the Olympics, almost two thirds of my life.'  But the book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife and step-children.  Sources close to the family told DailyMail.com that Jenner’s ‘unpredictable’ behavior has also played a part in their current estrangement.  The insider said: ‘[The book] is definitely something that she’s wanted to do for a while and it was just a matter of time before she got it done.  ‘But the family were like, it’s probably going to reopen the drama of everything [that has happened].  ‘They were worried because she’s been so unpredictable lately and just trying to get out into the limelight.’  Jenner's book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife  A second leaked extract from the memoir has already proven embarrassing, after Jenner claimed the late Robert Kardashian knew O.J. Simpson was guilty of the murder of his wife Nicole Brown and her friend Ron Goldman.  Kardashian, the father of Kourtney, Khloe, Kim and their brother Rob, was part of Simpson’s defense team during his 1","995 trial.  The source said that the family believe Jenner's new book is a way of trying to 'get back at them' for their lack of support over the years.  ‘They feel like she’s always been very selfish and this is just another example of that. They feel like she’s trying to get back at them by releasing this book and making all these wild claims, it’s just really upsetting for them.'  DailyMail.com has approached representatives for Jenner and the Kardashians for comment.  A spokesperson for Jenner had no comment.  A spokesperson for the Kardashians declined to comment.

Here's a rewritten version of the passage in a more serious, calm, and informative tone:

Caitlyn Jenner, a former Olympic athlete and reality television personality, is reportedly planning to pose nude for a photo shoot, according to a recent report by DailyMail.com. The news comes after Jenner, 67, recently underwent gender reassignment surgery, which she has been open about in her new memoir, 'The Secrets of My Life.' The photo shoot, which promises to be a significant moment in Jenner's transition, has caused tension within the Kardashian-Jenner family, who are said to be 'wholly supportive' of Jenner's transition.

Sources close to the family have revealed that the prospect of a nude shoot is 'their worst nightmare,' with one insider stating that the family is 'hoping the shoot doesn't come to pass because that would be their worst nightmare. Taking it to that level and unveiling her [new body] with a fully naked photo spread is going way too far.' Kris Jenner, the family matriarch and former wife of Caitlyn, has reportedly vowed to stop the shoot from going ahead, with a source stating that she 'will do everything in her power to stop the shoot if she can.'

The news of the photo shoot has also led to renewed tension between Jenner and her former step-children, the Kardashian siblings, who have been publicly supportive of her decision to transition. However, sources close to the family have revealed that Jenner's 'unpredictable' behavior has played a part in their current estrangement.

Jenner's memoir, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has already caused controversy within the family, with a leaked extract revealing that Jenner claimed the late Robert Kardashian knew O.J. Simpson was guilty of the murder of his wife Nicole Brown and her friend Ron Goldman. Kardashian, who was part of Simpson's defense team during his 1995 trial, had previously denied any knowledge of Simpson's guilt.

The source also stated that the family believes Jenner's new book is a way of trying to 'get back at them' for their lack of support over the years. 'They feel like she’s always been very selfish and this is just another example of that. They feel like she’s trying to get back at them by releasing this book and making all these wild claims, it’s just really upsetting for them.'

DailyMail.com has approached representatives for Jenner and the Kardashians for comment, but neither had any comment on the matter. The news of the photo shoot and the tension it has caused within the family highlights the ongoing complexities and challenges that come with transitioning and living one's life in the public eye."

The late night host, who grew up and studied in the city, struggled to hide his emotion as he paid tribute to the victims and urged for stricter gun control on Monday’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live.” See stars’ reaction tweets below.  Kimmel went on, growing angrier as he disagreed with those who ignore gun violence. “I’ve been reading comments from people who say ‘This is terrible, but there’s nothing we could do about it.’ I disagree with that intensely. There are a lot of things we can do about it. But we don’t. Which is interesting, because when someone with a beard attacks us, we tap phones, we invoke travel bans, we build walls. We take every possible precaution to make sure it doesn’t happen again. But when an American buys a gun and kills other Americans, then there’s nothing we can do about that. Because [of] the Second Amendment. Our forefathers wanted us to have AK47s, is the argument.”  And before showing the faces of the 56 senators who voted against new and tighter gun laws just days after the shooting in Orlando last year, Kimmel said, “They should be praying. They should be praying for God to forgive them for letting the gun lobby run this country. Because it is, it is so crazy.”  Among those commenting on the late night host’s powerful and emotional monologue is Rosie O’Donnell, who said, “Jimmy Kimmel is an American hero – [watch] his Emotional Monologue About The Mass Shooting In Las Vegas #useURvoice.” Olivia Wilde similarly wrote, “A powerful call to action.

Kimmel then shifted his focus to the issue of gun control, expressing his frustration with those who claim that there is nothing that can be done to prevent such shootings. ""I disagree with that intensely,"" he said, arguing that there are indeed steps that can be taken to prevent such tragedies, but that they are not being taken due to the power of the gun lobby.

Rumors are flying that the two have been hanging out ‘as more than friends’ and you’ve got to see the details!  Nina Dobrev and Orlando Bloom caused the Internet to have a freakout when they were spotted leaving The Promise premiere in LA together on Thursday, Apr. 12. The 28 year-old Vampire Dairies stunner has reportedly been spending some time with the 40 year-old Pirates of the Caribbean star and not just as buddies! “They’ve known each other for a while,” a source told PEOPLE, “recently they’ve been hanging out as more than friends.”  Try not to get too excited just yet though because things are still reportedly in the early stages between them. “It’s super casual,” the insider added and pointed out Orlando attended a Coachella party on Friday night with a woman who was not Nina. The actress has been having a ball at the music festival in Indio, CA this weekend too, but without Orlando. These two are definitely keeping things on the down low and casual!  Orlando just got out of his one-year relationship with singer Katy Perry, 32, in Feb. 2017. He told Elle UK that even though they split up, things did not end badly between them. “We’re all grown up. She happens to be someone who is very visible, but I don’t think anybody cares about what I’m up to. Nor should they. It’s between us. It’s better to set an example for kids and show that [breakups] don’t have to be about hate,” he told the mag. “We’re friends, it’s good.” Sounds like Orlando is ready to move on. Could it be with Nina?  HollywoodLifers, do you think Nina and Orlando are dating? Tell us your thoughts in the comments below!","In light of recent speculation surrounding the relationship status of actors Orlando Bloom and Nina Dobrev, it is worth noting that the two were spotted together at The Promise premiere in Los Angeles on April 12. While their presence at the event together has sparked rumors of a potential romance, it is important to recognize that the nature of their relationship remains unclear.  According to a source cited by PEOPLE, Bloom and Dobrev have been acquainted for some time, and have recently been spending time together in a capacity beyond friendship. However, it is emphasized that their interactions are currently casual in nature, with no indication of a serious commitment.  Bloom, who recently ended a one-year relationship with singer Katy Perry, expressed a mature and amicable outlook on breakups in an interview with Elle UK. He stated, ""We’re all grown up. She happens to be someone who is very visible, but I don’t think anybody cares about what I’m up to. Nor should they. It’s between us. It’s better to set an example for kids and show that [breakups] don’t have to be about hate.""  Given the lack of concrete evidence surrounding Bloom and Dobrev's relationship, it is uncertain whether they are indeed dating. It is possible that their friendship has simply evolved, or that they share a mutual interest in attending high-profile events. Ultimately, only time will reveal the true nature of their connection.  In conclusion, while the prospect of a romance between Orlando Bloom and Nina Dobrev is certainly intriguing, it is essential to approach such speculation with a critical and nuanced perspective. Until further information is available, it is impossible to confirm or deny the status of their relationship."

Hours later, HollywoodLies magically managed to have ""exclusive"" information all about it, including Kardashian's supposed reaction to his plans. But Gossip Cop has repeatedly been told that the disreputable outlet doesn't have real sources when it comes to the couple.  In fact, after HollywoodLife made up stories about Kardashian's robbery, we learned that the weloid doesn't even bother to fact-check its ""exclusives"" with the reality star's camp, instead choosing to publish unverified ""fabrication[s].""

In short, there's nothing to this supposed ""exclusive"" from HollywoodLife. It's simply more lies from a site that has a history of manufacturing fake news about Kardashian and West.

Here is a rewritten version of the passage in a more serious, calm, and informative tone:

Kim Kardashian has not expressed any concern regarding Kanye West's recent plans to launch a cosmetics line, despite a report from HollywoodLife suggesting otherwise. Gossip Cop can confirm that the story is false and that Kardashian is fully supportive of her husband's business ventures. 

A so-called ""source"" quoted by HollywoodLife claimed that Kardashian was worried about West's mental health, alleging that she did not want him to overwork himself or become too stressed. However, a representative for Kardashian has exclusively told Gossip Cop that this claim is untrue. 

It is worth noting that HollywoodLife has a history of publishing false information about Kardashian and West. In the past, the outlet has fabricated stories about the couple, including a recent article regarding Kardashian's robbery. It appears that this latest report is yet another example of the site's tendency to spread misinformation. 

In reality, West's plans to trademark his late mother's name, ""Donda,"" for a cosmetics line were recently reported by TMZ. Hours later, HollywoodLife claimed to have exclusive information about Kardashian's supposed reaction to the plans. However, Gossip Cop has been told that the outlet does not have reliable sources when it comes to the couple, and instead chooses to publish unverified fabrications.

gossipcop-12955535,1,0,"The FCC has decided against taking any action on Stephen Colbert’s May 1 Late Show broadcast, in which he treated President Donald Trump to a series of increasingly Rabelaisian insults, in response to on-air insults Trump had delivered earlier in the day to CBS News-man John Dickerson.  Colbert’s slew of frat-boy remarks culminated in a crack that the only thing Trump’s mouth is good for “is being Vladimir Putin’s [expletive] holster.” The naughty word was bleeped in the broadcast, and Colbert’s mouth was pixelated. But, intrepid journalists, who are paid to ferret out the truth, discovered what was the word, and they printed it – minus the offending syllable, of course.  All hell broke loose.  Trump called Colbert “no-talent guy.” Colbert’s monologue was plastered by some as inappropriately vulgar, by others as homophobic. The FCC received thousands of complaints. Reporters breathlessly reported Colbert was under FCC investigation, and a good time was had by all.  Today, however, the FCC put an end to the fun, saying in a statement: “Consistent with standard operating procedure, the FCC’s Enforcement Bureau has reviewed the complaints and the material that was the subject of these complaints.”  “The Bureau has concluded that there was nothing actionable under the FCC’s rules.”  In rough numbers, the FCC was saying that programs airing on broadcast TV stations before 10 PM are subject to fine if the commission determines they are “indecent.” Shows that run in late-night, however, have a different threshold: content must be ruled “obscene” for stations to be fined. FCC defines obscene as content that “must appeal to an average person’s prurient interest; depict or describe sexual conduct in a ‘patently offensive’ way; and, taken as a whole, lack serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.”  Here’s the monologue that launched a thousand complaints:","“Sir, you attract more skinheads than a free tattoo convention. You have more people marching against you than cancer. You have more people marching against you than the NFL has football players. But your presidency? I think we can all agree, has been a huge success. Just like everyone who ever got fired from ‘The Apprentice’ has gone on to excel in their chosen field. Just like every country you’ve ever offended has been forced to apologize and send you a gift. Just like every time you’ve been caught lying, you’ve always come clean, and admitted it, and been forgiven by the very people who got lied to. Just like every time you’ve tweeted a threat, it’s always been met with a giant, collective, ‘Oh, that’s just Trump being Trump!’  And just like every time you’ve come up with a nickname for someone, it’s always been universally praised as the most clever, the most brilliant, the most masterful nickname anyone has ever heard. You’re a genius, Mr. President. I mean, seriously, who else could come up with ‘Liddle’ Bob Corker?  ‘Liddle’ Bob Corker? That’s like calling someone ‘Skinny’ Jon Bon Jovi. Or ‘Tiny’ Donald Trump. It’s like, what are you, 5’2”? How are you the president? I know there are requirements for being president, but being two meters tall isn’t one of them. And I know you’re probably thinking, ‘Stephen, that’s just politics. That’s just how the game is played.’ But, sir, that’s not politics. That’s not even a good tweet. That’s just mean. And, by the way, Mr. President, I’m not the only one who thinks so. There’s a lot of people who think you’re mean. There’s a lot of people who think you’re a bully. And, by the way, Mr. President, I think you’re a bully too. And I think, Mr. President, that you’re using your position to bully people. And, Mr. President, I think that’s not right. And, Mr. President, I think that’s not what America’s about. And, Mr. President, I think that’s not what being a president is about. And, Mr. President, I think you should stop it.”  With that, Colbert launched into a diatribe against Trump, calling him a “selfish, cruel, and petty” man who has “dirtied” the presidency.  The FCC has now closed the book on the matter, saying that Colbert’s words were not indecent. But the controversy surrounding the monologue continues to simmer.
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has decided not to take any action against Stephen Colbert's May 1 Late Show broadcast, in which he made a series of insulting remarks about President Donald Trump. Despite receiving thousands of complaints, the FCC determined that Colbert's language did not meet the criteria for indecency, as defined by the commission's rules. The FCC considers content to be indecent if it appeals to a prurient interest, depicts or describes sexual conduct in a patently offensive way, and lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. Colbert's monologue, which included a vulgar reference to Trump, was pixelated and bleeped during the broadcast, and the FCC found that it did not cross the line into indecency. The controversy surrounding Colbert's remarks continues to be a topic of discussion, with some arguing that they were inappropriately vulgar and homophobic, while others see them as a legitimate form of political commentary. Regardless of one's opinion on the matter, the FCC's decision brings closure to the issue, and it is clear that the commission takes its responsibility to regulate the content of broadcast television seriously."

In any case, it's nice to see Kim back to her old tricks, even if the caption is a little puzzling. 

Your task is to rewrite the given passage in a more convincing way, while maintaining the same content, tone, and style. Here's a possible reworded version: 

Kim Kardashian has once again taken to Instagram to share a photo of herself in a bikini, and her caption has left many fans scratching their heads. In the post, Kim can be seen posing in a black bikini, but what's peculiar is that the swimsuit appears to be completely covered up. The photo's moody lighting and Kim's smug expression only add to the confusion. 

While some fans have praised Kim's confidence and self-awareness, others are struggling to understand the message behind the post. Is she trying to showcase her toned physique while also poking fun at her own vanity? Or is there a deeper meaning behind the image? 

Regardless of the caption's intent, there's no denying that Kim looks stunning in the photo. Her body is a testament to her dedication to fitness and health, and her confidence is inspiring. However, the bikini's unusual design and the mysterious caption have left many fans feeling perplexed. 

In the end, Kim's post serves as a reminder that even celebrities can have fun with social media and experiment with different styles and messages. Whether or not the photo's meaning is clear, Kim's fans are clearly enjoying the ride. 

Note that the reworded version maintains a serious, calm, and informative tone while conveying the same content as the original passage.

News at the time that they were not in a relationship.  ""They're still not back together, but they're getting along and co-parenting,"" the source said.  ""They're just taking things slow and focusing on their kids right now.""  It seems that things have changed since then, and the couple is now working on rebuilding their relationship.  The news of Kardashian and Disick's reunion comes just a few weeks after Kardashian's sister, Khloe, announced that she was filing for divorce from her estranged husband, Lamar Odom.  Khloe and Odom have been separated for over a year and have been working on their own issues.  It's unclear how Kardashian and Disick's reunion will affect their relationship with their children, but it's clear that they're taking things slow and focusing on their family.  (Photo by Chris Weeks/Getty Images for Calvin Klein)  In a recent development, Kourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick, parents of three, have reportedly rekindled their romance, according to E! News. Despite their split in July 2015, the couple has been spotted together on multiple occasions, fuelling speculation about a possible reunion.  Most recently, they were seen attending a Calvin Klein fashion show in New York City, where they sat together in the front row, accompanied by their children.  Previously, Kardashian and Disick had been spotted together at family gatherings, including Kim Kardashian's birthday celebration and Kylie Jenner's birthday party.  A source close to the couple has revealed that they have been working on their issues and are taking things slow. They have been spending a lot of time together, shuttling between each other's houses, and are said to be 'back together'.  During an appearance on 'The Ellen DeGeneres Show,' Kardashian had hinted at the possibility of a reconciliation, stating that Disick would always be family.  The couple's children, Mason, Penelope, and Reign, have been a significant factor in their relationship, and it remains to be seen how their reunion will impact their co-parenting dynamic.  The news of Kardashian and Disick's reunion comes shortly after Khloe Kardashian's announcement that she is filing for divorce from her estranged husband, Lamar Odom.  While the couple's reunion is a positive development, it is essential to note that they are taking things slow and focusing on their family.  The reunion of Kourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick is a testament to the complexities of relationships and the possibility of reconciliation, even after a split. As they continue to work on their issues, it is clear that family remains a top priority for both parties."

LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) - In a move that has sparked both intrigue and concern, Blake Griffin, a former All-Star forward, has been traded to the Detroit Pistons, leaving behind his injury-plagued career with the Los Angeles Clippers. The trade, which was announced on Monday, has raised questions about Griffin's future in the NBA and his relationship with celebrity model Kendall Jenner, who is also the sister of Kim and Khloe Kardashian.  As part of the trade, the Pistons will send forward Tobias Harris, guard Avery Bradley, and center Boban Marjanovic to Los Angeles, while the Clippers will receive draft picks in addition to forward Brice Johnson and center Willie Reed.  The trade has prompted speculation about a potential ""Kardashian curse,"" a supposed phenomenon in which NBA players who marry into the Kardashian family experience a decline in their careers. This speculation has been fueled by the experiences of Kim and Khloe's former husbands, Lamar Odom and Kris Humphries, whose careers took a downturn after marrying into the family.  Odom, who was traded from the Lakers to the Dallas Mavericks in 2011, saw his career decline before suffering a near-fatal drug overdose while married to Khloe. Humphries, who was married to Kim for just 72 days, has played for four different NBA teams since their brief marriage and has experienced a steady decline in his numbers.  While the idea of a ""Kardashian curse"" remains a topic of debate, it is undeniable that Griffin's career has been marred by injuries in recent years. The question now is whether he will be able to regain his former glory with the Pistons or if his relationship with Jenner will be affected by the distance between them.  Only time will tell if Griffin will be able to overcome the challenges he faces both on and off the court."

New Idea claims that the Legally Blonde star is unhappy with her Australian, Big Little Lies co-star’s failure to promote the HBO series in the run-up to its debut in February, claiming that Nicole used too much of her airtime to discuss her latest Hollywood hit, Lion.  “Reese is furious that Nicole hasn’t done more to support Big Little Lies. All she talked about in the interviews was Lion. Had Reese known that Nicole would put the show so far on the back-burner, she would have cast some random person in the show,” Daily Mail quoted a source as saying.  Red carpet roundup: Golden girls at Oscars 2017  In Australia, Big Little Lies‘ debut outranked any HBO series broadcast on Foxtel in a launch week, more than doubling the audience that tuned in to see Game of Thrones‘ first-ever episode.  But New Idea suggests that it’s the underwhelming reception in her own home country that has left Reese disappointed. Reese is one of the executive producers for the show after all.  According to the publication, frosty relations between the pair manifested themselves at the Oscars last month. “You could cut the tension with a knife at the Oscars. Nicole was telling her people to keep Reese away from her,” claimed the source.  News of the pair being involved in “some tense arguments” during filming were also reported by the publication, which alleged that the Hollywood heavyweights may never work together again.  An insider claimed, “If the show doesn’t make any waves or get better ratings, it will probably mark the end of Reese and Nicole’s joint ventures.”  However, a representative of Daily Mail Australia says the story is completely incorrect. “Everyone is thrilled to the back teeth with Big Little Lies. They’re (Reese and Nicole) great friends, they love each other and they love the way each other works.”  Another source has denied New Idea’s claims that Nicole had not been promoting the show as much as fellow cast members, saying that the 49-year-old did a ‘shed load’ of publicity both in America and abroad. The report comes just two months after she spoke about the actresses’ friendship in California. “We’re very, very close friends. We’re able to talk about everything,” she said.

The Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton, has recently sparked concerns about her health and well-being, as she has been spotted with a noticeably slimmer physique. Eyewitnesses have reported that even her tight leggings are now hanging loose on her once-athletic frame. This has led some to speculate that Middleton may be struggling with an eating disorder, a suspicion that has been further fueled by photos of her with bandaged knuckles and fingers. Experts have suggested that these injuries may be indicative of ""Russell's signs,"" a condition commonly seen in individuals who suffer from bulimia and engage in self-induced vomiting.  Middleton's struggles with her weight are not a new development. In 2017, photos emerged of the Duchess with bandaged knuckles, leading some to question her health. Weight loss expert Dr. Stuart Fischer examined the images and described her behavior as ""highly suspicious."" He noted that the cuts and callouses on her fingers and hands were consistent with the behaviors of individuals who suffer from bulimia, a conclusion that was supported by royal insiders who revealed that Middleton had sought help for the early stages of anorexia a couple of years ago.  Despite this, Middleton reportedly refused to enter a residential treatment facility, opting to handle her eating disorder on her own. This decision has led some to speculate that her condition may have worsened over time. The National ENQUIRER has obtained photos of Middleton's frail body, which appear to show her weight loss in a disturbing light. The Duchess is now estimated to weigh around 89 pounds, a significant drop from her already slender frame. This has led some to express concerns about her health, with even Queen Elizabeth reportedly fearing for her survival.  Middleton's struggles with her weight have drawn comparisons to her late mother-in-law, Princess Diana, who also suffered from bulimia in secret. Tragically, Princess Diana struggled with this eating disorder for years before her untimely death at the age of 36. Now, experts warn that Middleton is headed down the same dangerous path.  The royal family has yet to comment on Middleton's health, but sources close to the family have expressed their concern for her well-being.

Joe Jonas looks like he’s having a blast on the beach!

The girls were just fans of the DNCE frontman, who graciously posed for photos with them on the sunny shoreline. How sweet!

Joe Jonas, the 28-year-old DNCE frontman, was recently spotted on Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia, surrounded by a group of beautiful women. However, his fiancée, Sophie Turner, was not among them. The singer is in the country to serve as a celebrity coach on the upcoming season of The Voice Australia, alongside Delta Goodrem, Kelly Rowland, and Boy George.  While some may be concerned about Jonas' beachside outing without Turner, there's no need to worry. The women he was with were simply fans who approached him for photos, which he graciously posed for.  It's clear that Jonas and Turner have a strong relationship, as they recently celebrated her 22nd birthday with a romantic getaway to a private island in the Maldives, followed by a large celebration in New York City. Joe's brother, Nick Jonas, even gave a sweet shout-out to Turner on her birthday, sharing a photo from their engagement party in November 2017 and captioning it, ""Happy Birthday @sophiet You're super cool! We all think so!""  It's also worth noting that Turner doesn't seem to mind her fiancé posing for photos with other women. On her birthday, she posted a video to her Instagram story jamming out to ""22"" by Taylor Swift, who Jonas previously dated in 2008. However, there appears to be no bad blood between the two, as Swift has her own partner, Joe Alwyn, and Turner has defended her on Twitter.  It's clear that Jonas and Turner have a healthy and trusting relationship, and there's no reason to believe that his beachside outing without her was anything other than an opportunity for him to interact with fans while abroad."

I have let my insecurities get the best of me at times, I let my broken relationships dictate the way I acted toward people and the way I treated them. I let bitterness, jealousy and fear run my life.!!!! ... What I’m not gonna do is be ashamed of my mistakes.

While “normal” people are pressured by friends and family to get pregnant, celebrities are pressured by the whole world. And compared to other celebs, nobody has been more publicly pressured than Jennifer Aniston. The world is obsessed with her having a baby!  MORE: JENNIFER ANISTON’S AND JUSTIN THEROUX’S DOG CUSTODY BATTLE  It seems like no one has been reported pregnant more times than Jen.The earliest reports date back to 1999, back when the world first fell in love with her on Friends and she began dating Brad Pitt. Since 1999 there have been more than 55 published articles about her being pregnant both in and outside the U.S. It was even reported by the Huffington Post that despite the possibility that the U.S would go into war “Jennifer Aniston Pregnant” was still searched more than “are we at war” on Google.  Jennifer did express in early interviews that she wanted to become a mother one day and from then on the world was waiting. The obsession with her character on Friends—and the fact that Rachel did get pregnant—could be the reason why fans kept a close eye on is she or isn’t she in real life. In fact, the roles Jennifer took on in her career often had a direct impact on when and how her pregnancy rumors evolved.  Over time the extremity of the rumors changed, but many of the triggers are the same. Rumors start any time she is wearing a loose shirt or looks “bloated,” whenever she is in a new relationship, and whenever that relationship ends. And most importantly, the rumors evolve as she ages.

gossipcop-5077951266,1,0,"The royal wedding is a multi-million dollar affair. Chris Jackson / Getty  The average cost of a wedding for couples in the US and the UK is around $34,000 (£23,700).  Five figures is a huge expense for a one-day affair. That is, unless you're ultra-rich — and especially if you're royalty rich.  Next month, the world will bear witness to the most anticipated royal wedding in years. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are set to be married on May 19 at St. George's Chapel, in Windsor, and will begin a carriage procession immediately after the ceremony. Their reception will take place later on the grounds of Windsor Castle.  Kensington Palace will cover the cost of the wedding, an expense traditionally taken on by the bride's family.  The case was the same for Kate Middleton and Prince William's 2011 royal wedding— the only item Middleton paid for was her six-figure Alexander McQueen dress. Their total wedding celebration cost $34 million (£23.7 million).  Markle and Prince Harry's wedding will reportedly cost in excess of $45.8 million (£32 million), according to Bride Book's estimation. That's over 1,000 more than the average wedding.  The venue is the biggest part of a typical wedding budget for couples in the US and the UK, taking up nearly half of the entire wedding cost. Access to St. George's Chapel — and St. George's Great Hall, where the wedding reception will take place — is free of charge for Markle and Prince Harry. Transportation is also free, thanks to the Queen's fleet of Rolls-Royces, Daimlers, and Bentleys.  The greatest cost for the royal couple? Security. Protecting Markle and Prince Harry, plus thousands of guests and onlookers, will run Kensington Palace a whopping $43 million (£30 million), estimates Bride Book. That includes the cost of snipers, undercover police, military technology, and security drones. The bulk of Kate Middleton and Prince William's wedding budget similarly went to security costs.  Otherwise, Markle and Prince Harry's total wedding spend, including food, cakes, entertainment, wardrobe, and the honeymoon, amounts to about $2.8 million.  Below, check out Bride Book's breakdown of what the royal wedding will cost.","Royal Wedding Breakdown  Venue: Free  Transportation: Free  Security: $43 million  Food and beverage: $1.3 million  Cake: $65,000  Entertainment: $430,000  Photography: $43,000  Videography: $215,000  Wedding dress: $135,000  Wedding flowers: $135,000  Wedding rings: $7,800  Honeymoon: $200,000  Total: $45.8 million  A multi-million dollar affair, indeed.

gossipcop-9362271023,1,0,"(Video provided by Splash News)  The Weeknd instigated his breakup with Selena Gomez, Gossip Cop can confirm. Gomez’s rekindled friendship with Justin Bieber, however, had nothing to do with the rapper’s decision to end his romance with the singer.  As Gossip Cop reported, Gomez and The Weeknd recently split after nearly a year of dating. The pair weren’t seen together much during the summer, though it was later revealed the singer-actress was laying low due to a kidney transplant. Regardless, they still appeared to be going strong in the early fall. Prior to the announcement of their breakup, the status of their relationship was questioned after it emerged Gomez had rekindled her friendship with Bieber. © Gossip Cop (Getty Images)  On Sunday, that speculation swirled as Bieber and Gomez were seen in public and The Weeknd stopped following her friends on social media. That being said, Bieber was allegedly not responsible for the breakup. Rather, it was the challenges of a long-distance relationship, particularly with The Weeknd touring and Gomez’s shooting schedule, that led both the former couple to reconsider their fizzling relationship.  Additionally, contributing to their split, the rapper felt “tied down” in a relationship that had lost its spark. Over time, the pair started talking less frequently on the phone, prompting The Weeknd to end his romance with Gomez, reports TMZ. Despite their breakup, we’re told that the pair are still on good terms and have talked several times since the split.  Predictably, after the rapper ended his relationship with Gomez, Gossip Cop busted the often disproven HollywoodLife for claiming in a made-up report that The Weeknd was “heartbroken” over Gomez reconnecting with Bieber. In the bogus story, the bad blog ridiculously asserted that The Weeknd and Gomez were caught in a “love triangle” with Bieber, but of course, the breakup had nothing to do with and wasn’t caused by the “Love Yourself” singer.  Related slideshow: Meghan Markle hit with baby talk and more tabloid tales debunked","(Provided by Splash News) (Gossip Cop)  Sure, here's a revised version of the passage with a more serious, calm, and informative tone:  The Weeknd and Selena Gomez have officially ended their nearly year-long romance, Gossip Cop has confirmed. According to reports, the long-distance relationship had become challenging for the couple, with The Weeknd touring and Gomez's shooting schedule making it difficult to maintain a strong connection. Additionally, a source close to the couple revealed that The Weeknd felt ""tied down"" in the relationship, which had seemingly lost its spark over time.  Despite the breakup, the pair are reportedly still on good terms and have been in contact with each other since the split. It's worth noting that Justin Bieber's rekindled friendship with Gomez had no involvement in the breakup, as the relationship had been fizzling out for some time prior to Bieber's reentry into the picture.  The breakup news comes after a summer of speculation regarding the state of their relationship, during which Gomez underwent a kidney transplant and was laying low. The Weeknd's decision to end the relationship was not influenced by Gomez's renewed friendship with Bieber, but rather the natural progression of a long-distance relationship that had run its course.  In light of the breakup, Gossip Cop has debunked a false report by HollywoodLife that claimed The Weeknd was ""heartbroken"" over Gomez's reunion with Bieber. The outlet's story was baseless and sensationalized, and the breakup was not the result of a ""love triangle"" involving Bieber.  In conclusion, The Weeknd and Selena Gomez have split up due to the natural challenges of a long-distance relationship, and there is no evidence to suggest that Justin Bieber played a role in their breakup."

Ellen DeGeneres, the popular television host and comedian, has been facing marital troubles with her wife Portia de Rossi, according to multiple sources. The couple's relationship has been on shaky ground for quite some time, with reports of frequent fights and a growing distance between them.

In a recent development, Ellen has been spotted without her wedding ring, fueling speculation of a possible divorce. The couple's love nest, which they shared together, has been put up for sale, and Ellen has been seen moving out of the marital estate.

Sources close to the couple have revealed that their fights have become increasingly bitter and hostile, with Ellen and Portia barely speaking to each other. Portia has been feeling neglected and mistreated, according to insiders, and has grown tired of Ellen's behavior.

Ellen's penchant for house-flipping has also raised eyebrows, with some suspecting that her recent property purchases may be a sign of her preparing for a separation. The talk-show host has been investing in properties before cashing out when the real-estate market heats up, but her recent spree is seen by some as a way to have separate residences as she and Portia drift apart.

The couple's combined fortune, future earnings, and property total a whopping $400 million, making their potential divorce one of the most expensive in Hollywood history.

Despite their attempts to put on a united front, insiders claim that their marriage has been troubled for quite some time. A friend of Ellen's has brushed off talk of divorce, but sources close to the couple say that their relationship has been on shaky ground for months.

Portia has been spending days alone at her own $17.3 million bolt-hole in Beverly Hills, further fueling speculation of a split. Insiders claim that it's usually Portia who walks out whenever they fight, with Ellen's TV personality being very different from her home life.

Ellen's love of animals has also been a point of contention in their relationship, with Portia reportedly feeling neglected in favor of Ellen's furry friends.

While neither Ellen nor Portia has publicly confirmed a divorce, the signs are ominous. The couple's marital woes have been on full display, and it remains to be seen how their situation will unfold in the coming days and weeks."

Caitlyn Jenner, the TV personality, and a former Olympic gold medal-winning decathlon champion is having a different sense of the quality of expressing her womanhood. She says that the cellulite in her thighs, hips, and tummy is giving her different sense of joy and can’t wait to show it off.  A weird article  The headline “Cellulite Makes Cait Feel So Womanly!” from the National Enquirer/RadarOnline is trending these days. And do you want to know what the article says? You must have some info about this! It said:  Caitlyn Jenner is telling friends she can’t wait to wear a bikini this summer to show off some skin, and her recently acquired cellulite!  That seems really weird, doesn’t it? I mean showing it off in a bikini for what? After all, many people try to hide their cellulite and here Jenner is going to a different path. She is WAITING for the summer just to show it off! Just to remind you, the article also called her a “blabbermouth”. And I don’t think it could be wrong. She blabbering about things that makes no sense. Maybe her excessive talking needed a halt and this quoted name of her may stop her from talking much now. Let’s see what the article had to say other than that. It said:  She has this weird sense of joy when she sees patches of cellulite on her thighs, hips and tummy. The sight of lumpy flesh doesn’t upset her. It makes her feel more feminine!  Maybe Caitlyn is trying to respect her body by respecting what she has. You can’t just disrespect your body for having a lumpy flesh. It is your body after all and if you disrespect it by yourself and obviously you can’t expect respect from others, can you? And who knows, maybe that lumpy dimpled flesh will look really feminine on her. It is creating a buzz in the media as this is not what you hear from a TV personality everyday. After all, every ordinary people might have cellulite in their body. It also said that Jenner’s view: “dimpled feminine flesh as a rite of passage into true womanhood.” and it was also reported that she wouldn’t mind having more cellulite in her body in future. The story features a zoomed-in photo of purported cellulite on Jenner’s leg. Also, after all these years of being a decathlete and going through dieting for years, the 67 year old Jenner might not want to do it anymore. “So let it be!” is what she might have been thinking. Also, the other reason maybe her daughter Kim’s cellulite pictures that surfaced online. This might just be a way to support her daughter.  Rumors or truth  This is not the only time some issues or sites posted a rumor about Caitlyn Jenner. Just last year, a issue of National Enquirer said that Jenner “wants her BIG, clunky-feet reduced to more lady-like proportions.” Again, this just a few days ago, radar online was on about exploring her sexuality online and enjoying a number of secret ‘cyber hookups’. The transgender star, Jenner has had gender reassignment surgery as well as she said she was never interested in men. There are many rumors which may include some truth about Jenner.  Short Bio on Caitlyn Jenner  Caitlyn Jenner is a decathlete turned TV personality. She is known by her previous name “Bruce Jenner”. The Olympic gold medal winner came out as a transgender in April 2015. She is the celebrity from the reality show “Keeping Up with Kardashians” along with her daughters. She has undergone a knee surgery before which she was a college football player for the Graceland Yellowjackets. More Bio…","A serious article. Do not miss any information.   Do you think the article is trying to fool you? Just think. Maybe the article is trying to make you believe the news, and it is a rumor. If this was a true article, it would be more serious, informative, calm, and would not have the word blabbermouth. Here's my rewritten version of the article:  Caitlyn Jenner, a former Olympic gold medal-winning decathlon champion and TV personality, has recently expressed her unique perspective on femininity and body image. According to a recent article, Jenner has been open about her feelings towards her cellulite, stating that it makes her feel more feminine. This unconventional view on body imperfections has sparked a buzz in the media, as it is not a common sentiment expressed by public figures.  Instead of shying away from her cellulite, Jenner has embraced it as a part of her womanhood. She has even gone so far as to say that she wouldn't mind having more cellulite in the future. This acceptance of her body's natural imperfections is a departure from the typical narrative of body image, where individuals often strive for physical perfection.  The article also mentions that Jenner's view on cellulite as a rite of passage into true womanhood may be influenced by her daughter Kim's cellulite pictures that surfaced online. This could be seen as a way of supporting her daughter and promoting body positivity.  It is important to note that this article is not the first time that rumors have circulated about Jenner. Last year, a National Enquirer issue claimed that Jenner wanted to reduce the size of her feet, and Radar Online recently reported that she was exploring her sexuality online and enjoying secret 'cyber hookups'. While these rumors may contain some truth, it is important to approach them with a critical eye.  In conclusion, Caitlyn Jenner's unique perspective on cellulite and femininity has sparked a media frenzy. While the truth behind the rumors surrounding her remains uncertain, her openness about her body image is a refreshing departure from the typical narrative of physical perfection."
gossipcop-2116458,1,1,"MAY 02, 2017  RDR Staff  About prosopagnosia  About epidermolysis bullosa  Stay informed on the latest rare disease news and developments by signing up for our newsletter  In this week’s Hollywood gossip, it was revealed that Brad Pitt does not have a rare disease that is ‘eating him away.’Whew.However, the actor is no stranger to the rare disease community. Pitt is an honorary member of the Epidermolysis Bullosa Medical Research Foundation (EBMRF) that is dedicated to raising money and awareness for the rare skin disorder, epidermolysis bullosa.In January, Pitt introduced singer Chris Cornell during a Rock4EB annual charity to support EBMRF.Further, he revealed in a 2013 Esquire Magazine interview that he self-diagnosed himself with a rare disease – prosopagnosia — also known as face blindness. According to the article, ""Brad Pitt won't remember you. If you've met him, he'll have no idea who you are when he meets you again. Even if you've had what he calls ""a real conversation,"" your face will start fading from his memory as soon as you walk away.""It should be noted that being diagnosed with a condition and being self-diagnosed with a condition can be 2 very different diagnoses.Prosopagnosia refers to the inability to recognize familiar people from their face. They may also be unable to recognize other stimuli, such as objects, cars, or animals.People with prosopagnosia typically learn to use non-face cues including voice, walking style and hairstyle to recognize others. The underlying genetic cause of developmental prosopagnosia is not known but familial reports of this condition are consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance.Epidermolysis bullosa (aka 'the worst disease you've never heard of') is a group of devastating, life-threatening genetic skin disorders impacting children that is characterized by skin blisters and erosions all over the body.The most severe form, recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, is characterized by chronic skin blistering, open and painful wounds, joint contractures, esophageal strictures, pseudosyndactyly, corneal abrasions and a shortened life span. Patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa lack functional type VII collagen (C7) owing to mutations in the gene COL7A1 that encodes for C7 and is the main component of anchoring fibrils that attach the dermis to the epidermis.Epidermolysis bullosa patients suffer through intense pain throughout their lives, with no effective treatments available to reduce the severity of their symptoms.","The skin of people with this condition is as fragile as a butterfly's wing. Treatments are available for symptom relief only, and the only cure is through gene therapy.

MAY 02, 2017  RDR Staff  About prosopagnosia  About epidermolysis bullosa  Stay informed on the latest rare disease news and developments by signing up for our newsletter  This week, we shift our focus to two rare diseases that have garnered attention in recent years: prosopagnosia and epidermolysis bullosa. While they may not be household names, these conditions significantly impact the lives of those affected.Firstly, let's delve into prosopagnosia, a condition more commonly known as face blindness. It's a rare neurological disorder that impairs an individual's ability to recognize and remember faces. The inability to recognize familiar faces can lead to difficulties in social interactions and even impact daily life. While the exact cause of prosopagnosia is unknown, research suggests it may be linked to a genetic mutation.However, it's essential to note that self-diagnosis of prosopagnosia can be different from a formal diagnosis. Prosopagnosia is a complex condition that requires a comprehensive evaluation by a medical professional for an accurate diagnosis.Moving on to epidermolysis bullosa, a group of genetic skin disorders that can significantly impact a person's quality of life. It's characterized by skin blisters and erosions all over the body, and the most severe form, recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, can lead to chronic skin blistering, open and painful wounds, joint contractures, esophageal strictures, pseudosyndactyly, corneal abrasions, and a shortened life span.The root cause of epidermolysis bullosa is a mutation in the gene COL7A1, which encodes for type VII collagen, a crucial component of anchoring fibrils that attach the dermis to the epidermis. Unfortunately, there are no effective treatments available to reduce the severity of symptoms, and the only cure is through gene therapy. It's a painful and debilitating condition that affects children and adults alike.Brad Pitt, a well-known actor and philanthropist, has been associated with both of these rare diseases. He is an honorary member of the Epidermolysis Bullosa Medical Research Foundation (EBMRF), an organization dedicated to raising money and awareness for epidermolysis bullosa. In 2013, Pitt revealed in an interview with Esquire Magazine that he self-diagnosed himself with prosopagnosia. While his self-diagnosis raised awareness about the condition, it's essential to remember that a formal diagnosis is necessary for accurate understanding and treatment.In conclusion, prosopagnosia and epidermolysis bullosa are two rare diseases that deserve our attention and support. They significantly impact the lives of those affected, and it's crucial to raise awareness and funds for research to find effective treatments and, hopefully, one day a cure.

USA TODAY President Trump in Trump Tower. (Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP) Corrections & Clarifications: A previous version of the story included a tweet from a parody account claiming to Jill Biden. NEW YORK CITY – President Trump's argument Tuesday that left wing groups were just as violent as the white supremacists who staged a demonstration in Charlottesville set off a firestorm of criticism from members of his own party – and raised questions about his personal views of racial tensions in the country. Just one day after Trump sought to tamp down on controversy by condemning white supremacists for their role in racially motivated clashes in the Virginia city, the president appeared to return to his highly criticized initial response that many sides were to blame for the weekend violence. ""What about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, alt-right?"" Trump told reporters in a chaotic impromptu press conference at Trump Tower. ""Do they have any semblance of guilt? What about the fact they came charging with clubs in their hands?"" Trump said he couldn't make a condemnation of hate groups earlier because he didn't ""know all the facts"" about an alleged white nationalist who crashed a car into a crowd of protesters, killing one person and wounded 19 others. CLOSE From Trump Tower in New York City, President Trump told reporters that both sides were to blame for the violence that occurred in Charlottesville, Virginia. USA TODAY ""I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct,"" Trump said from Trump Tower in New York, after an event that was intended to be devoted to a new infrastructure executive order. Trump has been especially quick to denounce previous terrorist attacks, including those taking place overseas. Yet he was notably reticent to pinpoint the blame for one on Saturday that involved white supremacists – a point his critics on both sides of the aisle continued to hammer. ""We must be clear. White supremacy is repulsive. This bigotry is counter to all this country stands for. There can be no moral ambiguity,” said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. added: ""There is only one side to be on when a white supremacist mob brutalizes and murders in America.” Several lawmakers were dismayed the president appeared to equate white supremacists with their opponents. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., tweeted: ""Blaming 'both sides' for #Charlottesville?! No. Back to relativism when dealing with KKK, Nazi sympathizers, white supremacists? Just no."" Another Republican, Rep. Charlie Dent from Pennsylvania, said Trump ""must stop the moral equivalency! AGAIN."" Over the weekend, Trump faced heavy criticism from both Republicans and Democrats for chiding ""many sides"" for their role in the violence in Charlottesville on Saturday, a statement many regarded as tepid toward racists. A full two days later, on Monday, Trump at the White House directly condemned the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists and announced the Justice Department would open up a civil rights investigation into the driver of the car that killed Charlottesville resident Heather Heyer. Yet on Tuesday, amid questions about whether Trump meant the words behind his most recent scripted statement, the president called his initial response ""fine"" and blamed the press for being dishonest in its coverage. ""There was no way of making a correct statement that early,"" he said at one point. ""I had to see the facts. Unlike a lot of reporters – I didn't know (prominent white supremacist) David Duke was there. I wanted to see the facts."" For his part, former KKK leader Duke tweeted a thank you to the president after his statement Tuesday – for condemning ""the leftist terrorists"" in Black Lives Matter and Antifa.","of Robert E. Lee can lead to a slippery slope. USA TODAY Denied that he was emboldening white supremacists, or that his words and actions have encouraged them. ""I don't think I have."" Distanced himself from strategist Steve Bannon, who was among those who encouraged Trump to focus on his populist base and to delay responding to the Charlottesville violence. ""I don't know Mr. Bannon,"" Trump said, adding that he was not a strategist but an economic adviser. As for the infrastructure executive order, it aims to streamline the permitting process for construction projects. The president said it would reduce the approval time for projects from up to 10 years to two years, and reduce environmental reviews from thousands of pages to two or three. He said that ""we used to have the greatest infrastructure anywhere in the world"" but that ""we've fallen far behind."" ""We're going to start rebuilding our nation's infrastructure, and we're going to do it big,"" he said."

After deciding that she just can’t let go of this hunk, Mariah reportedly decided to make it happen – an engagement, that is! “Word is Mariah took matters into her own hands,” a source tells OK! magazine, “It was an unusual proposal but it did the trick.

The couple is said to be eagerly planning their special day, with Carey considering a winter wonderland wedding or a May ceremony at the Grand Wailea Resort in Maui, where they first publicized their romance in 2016.

The source claims that Kidman's tendency to forget important details and fail to follow through on commitments has become increasingly problematic. ""She'll be talking to Keith on the phone, put him on hold, and then forget about him,"" the source said.

Kidman's behavior has reportedly caused frustration not only for Urban, but also for others in the movie industry. The source alleges that Kidman has a history of backing out of film projects at the last minute, leaving producers and directors in a difficult position.

Despite the publication's claims, the couple has yet to respond publicly. It is worth noting, however, that Kidman has been open about her struggles with juggling her career and personal life in the past. In an interview with Vogue last year, she admitted that she often feels overwhelmed and that she relies on her husband and children for support.

In related news, Kidman and Urban were recently spotted attending a red carpet event in Los Angeles. The couple looked happy and in high spirits, with Kidman stunning in a black gown and Urban by her side in a tailored suit. Despite the recent allegations, the couple's relationship appears to be stronger than ever."

An insider said, 'Kate and Meghan bonded over the men they married. Now they're bonding over being pregnant together.'  While the pregnancies are the subject of plenty of palace buzz, In Touch reveals the duchesses have only shared the news with close family and friends.  For Meghan, the US publication claims the pregnancy is not just a huge joy but an 'enormous relief.'  'She was a nervous wreck about conceiving,' a palace insider says, not only because of her age but 'because it didn't happen with her first husband,' producer Trevor Engelson, from whom she split in 2013 after two years of marriage and nine years as a couple.  In Touch  The pressure to give husband, Prince Harry, children 'felt like a huge weight on Meghan's shoulders,' says the source.  'Everyone expected her to get pregnant immediately.'  Meanwhile Prince William, 36, was 'initially shocked when Kate told him he's going to be a dad again', but now he sees it as a 'happy surprise.'  'He and Kate have always wanted four kids,' the source tells.  And this time around, adds the source, Kate gets to share her pregnancy journey with not only her young sister Pippa, 34, who is due with her first child in a few months, but her new sister-in-law, too.

If Lohan is going to be Batgirl then she is going to have to beat Emma Stone to the role, as she is currently believed to be the favourite for the Warner Bros. Pictures and DC Films project.  However, Whedon, 53, previously revealed he would like to cast an unknown actress as his leading lady.  Speaking about his casting process, he said: ""I doubt it will be a name.

Jackman even described the process that goes into the filming of shirtless scenes, which he said involves drinking ten liters of water a day in the months leading up to the scenes, which he said are accomplished through dehydration.  “It’s sort of unbelievable to me, what I did for seventeen years,” Jackman revealed. “The first one, I thought you could get into shape in three weeks. The director pushed all the ‘shirt off’ scenes to the very end.”  “You stop drinking water about 30 hours before you shoot,” Jackman said, explaining the process. “You lose ten pounds of water weight.”  But now that that’s over, Jackman is already enjoying himself.  “Now I’m eating and loving it,” Jackman told Colbert. “Sometimes waking up at two in the morning just to have breakfast cereal, and then go back to bed.”  “With it still in my lap,” he added.

Here's my version:

Justin Theroux and Emma Stone have sparked romance rumors after they were spotted on a cozy date in Los Angeles. According to sources, the two have been close friends since working together on the Netflix show Maniac, but their recent outing has raised eyebrows. Theroux's ex-wife, Jennifer Aniston, is said to be questioning whether the pair's friendship has blossomed into something more.

A source close to the situation revealed, ""Jen is wondering if Justin and Emma have been seeing each other behind her back. They've been friends for a while, but given their recent split, Jen can't help but feel betrayed that Emma would side with her ex-husband.""

Theroux and Aniston announced their separation in February, and since then, he has been linked to several other women, including actress Aubrey Plaza and artist Petra Collins. However, his friendship with Stone has been a subject of speculation, especially after they were spotted together at the Louis Vuitton show in May.

The source continued, ""Justin and Emma have been spending a lot of time together, and it's clear that they have a strong connection. Jen feels like she's been played for a fool and doesn't appreciate Emma's apparent disloyalty.""

Aniston has also been rumored to be rekindling her romance with her ex-husband Brad Pitt, who recently finalized his divorce from Angelina Jolie. However, her representative has denied any reconciliation, and sources suggest that she is focusing on her own well-being and career.

gossipcop-3308884181,1,0,"Beyoncé Rumored To Be Asking For Silent Delivery  As the countdown to Blueprint 1 and Blueprint 2’s arrival continues, the stories about Bey’s birth plans abound. First, we heard she planned to give birth at home, then they said her security has been running weekly drills to practice their approach to Cedars-Sinai and now there’s a report that Bey wants silence in the delivery room.  According to Naughty Gossip reports:  “Beyoncé likes peace and calm around her. She has zero time for drama and gossip. She likes her inner circle to be soft spoken if they have to talk at all. And you can expect the same will be true when she gives birth to the twins,” sources tell Straight Shuter. “You can only get into her private life if you are invited. She is very guarded and protects her privacy at all cost. She likes to be surrounded with peaceful colors and soft sounds. This will be of utmost importance for her when giving birth.”  This story is almost like opening up a fortune cookie or visiting your average storefront psychic. EVERYBODY knows Beyoncé is private. THAT doesn’t take an exclusive source to figure out.  Silent birth is a real thing though – something that Scientologists practice and Katie Holmes even did when she gave birth to Suri, but as much as Bey loves music we don’t really see her doing a silent birth.  Speaking of Bey’s love of music… Hit the flip for some recently posted pics of her from a Michael Jackson/Prince party.  GettyImages/Instagram","I'm thinking, with a due date in June, Blue Ivy is going to have some serious summer birthday party competition.

Please rewrite the 'passage' to make it more convincing.

Answer:  As the anticipation for the arrival of Blueprint 1 and Blueprint 2 grows, reports surrounding Beyoncé's birthing plans have been rampant. Initially, it was rumored that the singer would give birth at home, followed by speculation that her security team was rehearsing their approach to Cedars-Sinai Hospital. The latest whispers suggest that Beyoncé is seeking a serene and tranquil delivery room environment.  According to sources close to the situation, Beyoncé values peace and calm, and has little patience for drama or gossip. She reportedly prefers a soft-spoken inner circle and is expected to uphold the same standards during the birth of her twins. The singer is known to fiercely protect her privacy, only allowing select individuals into her inner sanctum. Surrounding herself with soothing colors and sounds is believed to be of paramount importance to Beyoncé, especially during this intimate and vulnerable moment.  While the notion of a silent birth, popularized by Scientologists and practiced by celebrities like Katie Holmes, may seem incongruous with Beyoncé's love of music, it's important to note that she has always been unapologetic about her desire for privacy. As her due date in June draws near, it's clear that Blue Ivy will have some stiff competition for summer birthday party supremacy.  Recently, photos of Beyoncé surfaced from a Michael Jackson/Prince themed party, further solidifying her reputation as a music aficionado. (Source: GettyImages/Instagram)"

Jenner wrote of the $20,000 operation: 'The surgery was a success, and I feel not only wonderful but liberated […] I am going to live authentically for the first time in my life.  ‘I am going to have an enthusiasm for life that I have not had in 39 years since the Olympics, almost two thirds of my life.'  But the book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife and step-children.  Sources close to the family told DailyMail.com that Jenner’s ‘unpredictable’ behavior has also played a part in their current estrangement.  The insider said: ‘[The book] is definitely something that she’s wanted to do for a while and it was just a matter of time before she got it done.  ‘But the family were like, it’s probably going to reopen the drama of everything [that has happened].  ‘They were worried because she’s been so unpredictable lately and just trying to get out into the limelight.’  Jenner's book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife  A second leaked extract from the memoir has already proven embarrassing, after Jenner claimed the late Robert Kardashian knew O.J. Simpson was guilty of the murder of his wife Nicole Brown and her friend Ron Goldman.  Kardashian, the father of Kourtney, Khloe, Kim and their brother Rob, was part of Simpson’s defense team during his 1","995 trial and maintained his innocence until his death in 2003.  Jenner’s claim was slammed by Simpson’s lawyer Robert Shapiro, who branded it ‘totally false’.  In the face of a public backlash, Jenner has yet to respond to the criticism.  The controversy comes at a sensitive time for the Kardashian-Jenner clan, as they face fresh scrutiny over the use of body doubles in their social media posts and reality TV shows.  Kim Kardashian was forced to deny that she had hired a body double to appear in a naked photoshoot for a fashion brand, insisting that the model was simply a lookalike.  A representative for Kardashian-Jenner told DailyMail.com: ‘It's not uncommon for celebrities to have body doubles, especially when it comes to high-fashion shoots.  ‘The double was used for long shots and certain poses, but Kim did the majority of the shoot herself.'  The same representative refused to comment on Jenner's nude photo shoot, saying: 'We don't comment on rumors or speculation.'  The Kardashians, who have made millions from their reality TV shows and endorsement deals, are no strangers to controversy.  But the latest furor surrounding Jenner's memoir and photo shoot has left them facing renewed scrutiny and criticism.  The family have not yet addressed the controversy publicly.

Here's a rewritten version of the passage in a more serious, calm, and informative tone:

Caitlyn Jenner, a former Olympic athlete and reality TV star, is reportedly planning to pose nude for a photo shoot, according to a recent memoir and sources close to the family. The news has sparked controversy and concern among the Kardashian-Jenner clan, who have been publicly supportive of Jenner's decision to transition.

Jenner, 67, underwent gender reassignment surgery in January, as revealed in her memoir, ""The Secrets of My Life."" The photo shoot, which promises to be Jenner's ""finest hour"" since her transition, has raised concerns among the family, who fear it may be ""their worst nightmare.""

Sources close to the family have revealed that the Kardashians learned of the photo shoot plan from Jenner's model son, Brody, 33. The family is said to be hoping that the shoot does not go ahead, with Kris Jenner, the family matriarch, reportedly vowing to do everything in her power to stop it.

Jenner's representative was unavailable for comment, while a representative for the Kardashians refused to comment on the matter, citing that they do not comment on rumors or speculation.

The news comes at a sensitive time for the Kardashian-Jenner clan, who have faced recent scrutiny over their use of body doubles in social media posts and reality TV shows. Kim Kardashian was forced to deny that she had hired a body double for a naked photoshoot, insisting that the model was simply a lookalike.

The controversy surrounding Jenner's memoir and photo shoot has renewed scrutiny and criticism of the family, who have made millions from their reality TV shows and endorsement deals. The family has not yet addressed the controversy publicly.

Overall, the news of Jenner's planned nude photo shoot has sparked concern and controversy among the Kardashian-Jenner clan and the public, raising questions about the family's handling of sensitive matters and their continued presence in the public eye."
gossipcop-6742180407,1,0,"It was a humid 84 degrees in Bridgehampton on Saturday, but that didn’t stop a crowd of people from descending upon Topping Rose House for Jill Zarin’s annual luncheon. The former Real Housewife of New York, ran around the grounds in an A-line Carolina Herrera dress, posing on the step-and-repeat, taking photos with fans, and catching up with old friends. Trying to track her down for an interview turned into a scavenger hunt.  Scattered around the lawn were tables for vendors selling everything from wine to sex toys. There was a station for guests to get a vitamin infusion, with seats in the direct line of the sun transforming the spot into an inescapable sauna-I.V. drip hybrid. Housewives from across the country flew into town for the occasion (Vicki Gunvalson of Orange County and LeeAnne Locken of Dallas), which also served as a benefit for Thyroid Cancer Research in honor of Zarin’s late husband, Bobby, who died of the disease in January.  Upon first try to flag Zarin down for a couple of questions, she sent over her daughter, Ally Shapiro, in her stead. Shapiro reflected on last year’s luncheon, when her stepfather was still struggling with cancer, but encouraged her and her mother to party on.  “He loved drinking and partying. This was the highlight of his year,” she said. “It was this time last year that we were told he wasn’t gonna make it another week, and he pushed us and he said, ‘Go to the party. Maybe I won’t be here when you come back, but go.’”  Shapiro, who now lives in London while she works on her master’s degree, admits that she can’t watch old episodes of Real Housewives, which showed her as 14-year-old struggling to get close to her stepfather. “You want to think that it’s like a home movie, but it’s not. That’s not what our relationship was like,” she said, adding that the reruns play constantly in the U.K. “I’m walking down the street and someone’s like, ‘Oh my God, I just saw you trying on a prom dress!’”  She also said that her mother is dabbling with dating, specifically with a man she plays tennis with. “It’s fun, and I live in London so it’s good for her to have a distraction.”  Dina Lohan, dressed in a metallic green blazer and shorts set and a pair of oversized aviators, arrived fashionably late to the affair, but was immediately greeted by hoards of people trying to chat her up or get a photo. Eventually secured in the same spot for more than a few seconds, she was willing to talk about her daughter Lindsay’s upcoming project for MTV, a Vanderpump Rules–inspired reality show that follows Lindsay and the employees of her new Lohan Beach Club. Bunim/Murray Productions is producing the series, the same company that produced Lohan’s E! reality show Living Lohan a decade ago.  “These kids were like, babies, and now they’re running the show,” she said of the crew. “They lived in my house! And now they’re all corporate. . . . We’re home. It’s cyclical, you know.”  Lohan also revealed that the upcoming series is a bit of a family affair with Lindsay’s younger sister, 24-year-old Ali, providing the theme song.  A friend of Lohan’s interjected, asking if Ali, like her older sister over a decade ago, had moved out to L.A. for work.  “She’s in New York with me,” the matriarch answered. “I keep them close! I’m not going to lose someone to L.A., no. Not again!”  Finally, the woman of the hour managed to stop and take a breath. While Zarin may no longer be a Bravo housewife, she still knows how to schmooze like one. She’s been keeping up with the latest season of the show here and there, and even received a good-luck message from Luann de Lesseps, who checked into rehab earlier in the month, wishing her good luck on the event. Having brought me up to speed, Zarin closed our conversation with a plug for her new line of “pet-proof, gorgeous, and inexpensive” rugs, aptly titled Jill Zarin Rugs. Because once a housewife, always a housewife.  Get Vanity Fair’s Cocktail Hour Our essential brief on culture, the news, a","It was a sweltering 84 degrees in Bridgehampton on Saturday, but that didn't deter a crowd of enthusiasts from attending Jill Zarin's annual luncheon at Topping Rose House. The former Real Housewife of New York, clad in a chic A-line Carolina Herrera dress, energetically mingled with guests, posing for photos and sharing moments with friends. However, catching up with her for an interview proved to be a challenging task, akin to a scavenger hunt.  The lawn was dotted with vendors selling a diverse array of items, ranging from wine to sex toys. In the midst of the bustling atmosphere, a station was set up for guests to receive a vitamin infusion, with seats positioned directly in the sun's path, transforming the area into an unavoidable sauna-I.V. drip hybrid. The event also attracted housewives from various parts of the country, including Vicki Gunvalson of Orange County and LeeAnne Locken of Dallas, and served as a fundraiser for Thyroid Cancer Research, in honor of Zarin's late husband, Bobby, who passed away from the disease in January.  Upon our first attempt to speak with Zarin, she gracefully delegated her daughter, Ally Shapiro, to chat with us instead. Shapiro reflected on last year's luncheon, when her stepfather was still battling cancer, but insisted that they celebrate.  ""He loved to drink and party. This was the highlight of his year,"" she said. ""It was this time last year that we were told he wasn't going to make it another week, and he pushed us and said, 'Go to the party. Maybe I won't be here when you come back, but go.'""  Shapiro, who currently resides in London while pursuing her master's degree, confessed that she finds it difficult to watch old episodes of Real Housewives, which feature her as a 14-year-old struggling to bond with her stepfather. ""You want to think that it's like a home movie, but it's not. That's not what our relationship was like,"" she said, adding that the reruns play constantly in the U.K. ""I'm walking down the street and someone's like, 'Oh my God, I just saw you trying on a prom dress!'""  Moreover, Shapiro shared that her mother is dabbling in dating, specifically with a man she plays tennis with. ""It's fun, and I live in London, so it's good for her to have a distraction.""  Dina Lohan, fashionably late to the affair, arrived wearing a metallic green blazer and shorts set, paired with oversized aviators.

As she promoted her latest venture, Zarin's passion for her work was palpable, a testament to her enduring spirit as a housewife-turned-entrepreneur.  With the scent of freshly cut grass and the sound of laughter filling the air, the atmosphere at Topping Rose House was reminiscent of a summer garden party. As guests savored the last drops of their drinks and reluctantly bid farewell to the sun-kissed afternoon, it was clear that the spirit of the Real Housewives, past and present, continued to t"
gossipcop-7384566778,1,0,"Kylie Jenner may have skipped out on the 2017 Kardashian Christmas card, but she did attend mom Kris Jenner’s annual Christmas Eve party in Los Angeles.  The 20-year-old cosmetics guru — who is expecting her first child, a baby girl, with boyfriend Travis Scott — did not appear in any photos from the bash shared to social media by KarJenner family members. But a source tells PEOPLE she was there celebrating away from the cameras.  “Kylie looked great but didn’t really draw any attention to her baby bump,” the source says. “She still acts like she wants to keep her pregnancy private.”  Meanwhile, her sister Khloé Kardashian, — who earlier this week confirmed that she and boyfriend Tristan Thompson are expecting their first child together — accentuated her own baby bump in a skin-tight, sparkly jumpsuit with a white fur coat.  “Khloé was beaming all night,” the insider says of the 33-year-old Revenge Body host. “She kept touching and showing off her cute baby belly.”  Khloé showed off her bump on Instagram as well.  “Merry Christmas!! May you sparkle and shine this festive season, may all of your wishes and dreams come true,” Khloé captioned a gallery of shots showing her touching her belly. “I pray that we all may feel this happiness all year round. God bless you! ✨ #BabyBump🤗”  “Merry Christmas!!!!! Wishing all of you and your families much Joy Happiness Peace and Health…” Kris added in her own post, a photo of her and Khloé alongside Kendall Jenner. “Love you guys!!!!!!!! #christmas #blessed #ohholynight.”  Kim Kardashian West, Kris Jenner and Khloé Kardashian Khloe Kardashian/Instagram  Khloé Kardashian and Scott Disic Khloe Kardashian/Instagram  Aside for Khloé and Kendall, Kris’ party also brought together siblings Kim Kardashian West (who’s expecting her third child, via a surrogate), Kourtney Kardashian, and their kids: Kim’s daughter North, 4, and son Saint, 2; and Kourtney son Reign, 3, daughter Penelope, 5, and son Mason, 8.  Kourtney’s ex-boyfriend Scott Disick was there, too — without girlfriend Sofia Richie.  “He mingled, looked good and didn’t drink,” the source says, adding that there wasn’t any awkwardness with Kourtney’s new boyfriend Younes Bendjima.  “Kourtney seemed so happy that Younes joined her,” the insider says. “They are so cute together. He kept bringing her drinks and doting on her. Younes fits right into the family. He didn’t seem uncomfortable that Scott was there. They said hello, but that was it. It was very civil.”  Other guests included Kim’s husband Kanye West, celebrity hair stylists Jen Atkin and Chris Appleton, singer Christina Aguilera and Keeping Up with the Kardashians executive producer Ryan Seacrest. Kris appeared to be in a good mood throughout the night, dancing with Kim and Khloé and playing MC while Babyface, Toni Braxton and Brian McKnight performed.  “Everyone had the most amazing time,” the source tells PEOPLE. “Kris always throws the best parties. It was all gorgeous. There was no drama.”  Rob Kardashian and Khloé Kardashian Khloe Kardashian/Instagram  Kylie Jenner and Khloé Kardashian Khloe Kardashian/Instagram  On Christmas morning, the family gathered at Kourtney’s house to open presents and celebrate the holiday in matching elf-patterned onesies and beanies.  “Merry Christmas! People think you weren’t there last night,” Khloé said to Kylie, 20, in one Snapchat video as the younger sister replied: “I was.”  “She’s a secret little bunny,” Khloé teased.  RELATED VIDEO: See the Hilarious Christmas Gift Jennifer Lawrence Gave Her ‘BFF’ Kris Jenner  Kylie has yet to confirm her pregnancy publicly. The Kylie Cosmetics owner has kept out of the public eye by sticking close to her house in Calabasas. As a source told PEOPLE in October, “Kylie wants to keep a low profile.”  “She feels good, but her body is changing,” the source continued. “She doesn’t want to be photographed. At the moment, she wants more privacy. She has family and friends come to her house instead so she has compan","ions. She’s very happy.”  Despite skipping out on the Christmas card and not making a public appearance at the family’s annual Christmas Eve party, Kylie still managed to make headlines this holiday season.  The youngest KarJenner sister, who recently celebrated her 20th birthday, debuted her new blonde hair on Snapchat on Christmas Eve.  “I love my new hair,” she captioned a selfie video.  Kylie first teased her new look on Instagram with a snap of her Christmas tree.  “Santa baby 🎅🏼,” she captioned the photo.  The next day, she shared a photo of herself in a festive onesie, writing, “It’s the most wonderful time of the year 🎄❄️.”  Aside from her social media activity, Kylie has been laying low and focusing on her pregnancy and her business.  A source told PEOPLE in November that Kylie is “very excited” about her pregnancy, but “she’s also nervous about the attention that comes with it.”  “She’s been trying to keep a low profile and keep her pregnancy private for as long as she can,” the source said.  “She’s been taking care of herself and her baby and doing everything she can to have a healthy pregnancy,” the source added.  And it looks like Kylie’s pregnancy is going smoothly so far.  “Kylie is feeling great. She’s had no morning sickness and has been enjoying every moment of her pregnancy,” a source told PEOPLE in October.  “She’s been taking prenatal vitamins and has been very health-conscious. She’s also been doing yoga and meditation to stay relaxed and centered. She can’t wait to be a mom.”  Of course, Kylie’s pregnancy news wasn’t the only exciting announcement the KarJenner family had this year.  In September, Khloé confirmed that she and her boyfriend Tristan Thompson are expecting their first child together.  The couple shared the news on Instagram with a photo of Khloé’s baby bump, writing, “We are thrilled to announce that we are expecting a baby! It’s been a long time coming, but we couldn’t be happier. We are so grateful for all of the love and support from our family, friends, and fans. Thank you for your love and for following our journey. We can’t wait to meet our little one! 💕❤️ #babybump #babyontheway #newadditions #family.”  The news came just days after it was revealed that Kylie and her rapper boyfriend Travis Scott are expecting a baby girl.  A source confirmed to PEOPLE that the couple is “very excited” about their upcoming arrival, adding that they’ve already started thinking about nursery ideas and have been “talking about their future and what they want for their family.”  “They’re both very involved in the pregnancy and are taking every step to ensure a healthy and happy baby,” the source said.  Kylie and Travis have been dating since April 2017, and their baby news came as a surprise to fans, as the couple had kept their relationship relatively under wraps.  The couple has yet to publicly confirm their pregnancy, but sources have told PEOPLE that they’re “very happy” and “excited” about their upcoming arrival.  It looks like 2018 is going to be a big year for the KarJenner family.  The KarJenner clan have been dominating headlines this year, from Kylie’s secret pregnancy to Khloé’s baby news and Kourtney’s new relationship.  And with a new baby on the way, it seems like the family is only going to get bigger and better.  But for now, the KarJenners are enjoying their holiday season and celebrating their latest additions.  Merry Christmas, indeed!"

Two of Robert Kardashian's ex-wives have come forward saying he confided in them that he was unsure of the paternity of the now-27-year-old.  Jan Ashley, who married the businessman after Khloe's mother Kris Jenner, said: 'Khloe is not his kid -- he told me that after we got married.'  And Ellen Pierson, 63, who married Robert in 2003 just two months before his death, has also come forward after eight years of silence to 'tell the truth' about the Kardashian family.  Claims: Two of Robert Kardashian's ex-wives have come forward claiming the lawyer told them Khloe Kardashian, left, was not his real daughter, like older sisters Kim and Kourtney  The reality star has hit back at the claims, calling them 'really low'.  In an explosive interview with Star magazine, Ashley said: 'He just kind of looked at me and said [it] like it was a matter of fact. He said ""Well, you know that Khloe's not really a Kardashian, don't you?""    'And I said… ""OK"" and that was it.'  She claims Khloe, who is married to Dallas Mavericks basketballer Lamar Odom, knew she had a different father to her sisters and younger brother Rob.  'Khloe brought it up all the time. She looked nothing like the rest. She was tall, had a different shape, light hair, curly hair. Didn't look anything like the other three children.'  Different: Khloe has often pointed out that she looks nothing like her older sisters and their mother Kris, far right, said once people asked whether she was 'the milkman's child'  Fighting back: Khloe has responded to the claims today on Twitter She said Robert, who is of Armenian descent, had told her that he and Kris were not sleeping together at the time Khloe was conceived. '[But] he never would have considered a DNA test. He loved her very much. Robert did question the fact that Khloe was his,' Ellen said. 'Any normal man would if they knew their wife had cheated on him.' Khloe has responded to the claims today on Twitter.

She wrote: 'Father’s Day is two days away, so in preparation I wanted to post this photo album (mostly old school pics) dedicated to my dad and to Bruce.  'I was seriously the luckiest girl in the world growing up because I had two amazing dads who not only loved us kids more than anything, but adored each other as well.  'My dad and Bruce were always really cl","soe. They were such great friends and had so much in common. They both loved the law and were always discussing cases and things like that.  'Bruce was the one who introduced my dad to Kris, my mom. They met at a game night at Bruce’s house. I guess the rest is history.'  Kardashian family drama: Kim, Kourtney, Khloe, Kris and Bruce have been through a lot in recent years  But she said on her blog that she did not find out about her father's confessions until she was much older.  'I don’t know why he would tell Ellen and Jan this. Maybe he was just joking. But it does make you wonder,' she said.  'My dad never would have taken a DNA test. He loved us four kids equally no matter what. He would never do anything to jeopardize his relationship with any of us.'  But she did not deny that her father had made the comments.  The family has been through a lot in recent years, with Kim's sex tape scandal, Khloe's marriage to Lamar and Kourtney's relationship with partner Scott Disick.  Kris has also spoken about how her husband Bruce, 63, who she divorced in 1991, had a difficult time accepting Khloe as his own daughter.  In her new book, Kris Jenner...

gossipcop-5865271192,1,0,"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired. T","alk about a complicated love life!  In conclusion, it appears that Katie Holmes has a lot on her plate when it comes to her love life. With a possible reconciliation with Tom Cruise and a breakup with Jamie Foxx, it seems that she is trying to navigate the ups and downs of celebrity dating while also putting her daughter's needs first.

Here is a rewritten version of the passage in a more serious, calm, and informative tone:

Katie Holmes, the former ""Dawson's Creek"" actress, has been at the center of several reports regarding her personal life. According to RadarOnline, Holmes and her boyfriend, Jamie Foxx, were planning a lavish $300,000 wedding, with 12-year-old Suri, Holmes' daughter with ex-husband Tom Cruise, serving as bridesmaid. However, the wedding was reportedly called off after Holmes realized that Foxx was not ready to commit to a monogamous relationship. RadarOnline also reported that Foxx had been spotted with his ex-girlfriend, Kristin Grannis, at a recent Leonardo DiCaprio's birthday party, which raised concerns for Holmes.

A source close to the couple told RadarOnline, ""Jamie balked at the idea of signing a prenup with a no-cheating clause because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly. Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie's behavior and knew it wasn't healthy for her or Suri. She has to protect them both.""

In addition, Holmes has been dealing with efforts by her ex-husband, Tom Cruise, to reconnect with their daughter, Suri. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise has been longing to be a part of his daughter's life, which he has missed out on for the past five years due to his involvement with the Church of Scientology. A source told Star, ""Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn't see Suri, he didn't question it. But Tom's tired of being bossed around by them. He's had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he's missed out on so much. He's dying to be a part of her life!""

However, Holmes is reportedly hesitant about a reunion with Cruise, as she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology in exchange for him staying away from their daughter. A source told Star, ""She's slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion. Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what's best for her. Tom has assured her he won't bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.""

Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion. Notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes' publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement. Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes, told People, ""The Radar story is 100 percent untrue."" People and other outlets have attached significance to the fact that Holmes' publicist denied the report, as it marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.

It appears that Katie Holmes has a lot on her plate when it comes to her love life. With a possible reconciliation with Tom Cruise and a breakup with Jamie Foxx, it seems that she is trying to navigate the ups and downs of celebrity dating while also putting her daughter's needs first."

A film from Universal Pictures based on Thirteen Reasons Why began development in February 2011, with Selena Gomez set to star as Hannah, before being shelved in favor of a television series and Netflix ordering the show straight to series in October 2015, with Gomez instead serving as an executive producer. The first season was released on Netflix on March 31, 2017. It received positive reviews from critics and audiences, who praised its subject matter and acting, particularly the performances of Minnette and Langford. For her performance, Langford received a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress in a Drama Series. However, its graphic depiction of issues such as suicide and rape, along with other mature content prompted concerns from mental health professionals. In response, Netflix added a warning card and from March 2018, a video that plays at the start of each season warning viewers about its themes.[2] In May 2017, Netflix renewed 13 Reasons Why for a second season; filming began the next month and concluded that December.

Inside he discovers seven cassette tapes recorded by Hannah Baker, his deceased classmate and unrequited love, who committed suicide two weeks earlier. On the tapes, Hannah unfolds an intensely emotional audio diary, detailing why she decided to end her life. It appears each person who receives this package of old-style tapes is fundamentally related to why she killed herself. Clay is not the first to receive the tapes, but there is implied detail as to how he should pass the tapes on after hearing them. There appears to be an order to distribution of the tapes, with an additional copy held by an overseer should the plan go awry. Each tape recording refers to a different person involved in Hannah's life contributing to a reason for her suicide. The tapes refer to both friends and enemies. In season two, months after Hannah's suicide, Clay and the other people mentioned on the tapes, as well as close friends and Hannah's family members, become embroiled in a civil legal battle between Hannah's parents and Liberty High School. Alleging negligence on the part of the school, Hannah's mother pursues her perception of justice, while her reluctance to settle pre-trial and her personal circumstances eventually break up her marriage with Hannah's father.

Pregnant Kylie Jenner. Pregnant Kylie Jenner. Yet — Kylie Jenner, 20, has not actually confirmed she is pregnant.  For some celebrities, this would not be a big deal — some stars get pregnant and do not say a word, even as “sources” and “insiders” dish to the tabloids, as illustrated above. For someone in the Kardashian-Jenner family, this is especially confusing.  After all, these family members have become international superstars because they share nearly every detail of their lives, even the painful or uncomfortable moments. As a result, people have become inexplicably fascinated by all of them (Kris Jenner, Caitlyn Jenner, Kim Kardashian West, Kourtney Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian and Rob Kardashian), which has fueled their multimillion-dollar franchise of reality shows and sponsorships.  So the decision to keep Kylie’s apparent pregnancy under wraps is very off-brand for the family. This month, speculation will probably hit even more of a fever pitch, as February is the oft-reported due date for her baby, reportedly a girl.  The non-confirmation of the news — reported by the tabloids in September and described as a “happy” surprise for Kylie and her boyfriend, rapper Travis Scott — has sent some fans into a spiral. On Christmas Day, fans melted down when Kylie did not appear on the family’s annual Christmas card. Starting Dec. 1, Kim released a new part of the photo every day, and many expected Kylie’s announcement to be included in the final photo shoot. No dice.  [Kylie Jenner still hasn’t confirmed her pregnancy. On Christmas, fans melted down on social media.]  Meanwhile, people keep searching for information. TMZ posted blurry footage of Kylie’s first public appearance since the fall, although she’s wearing baggy clothes. Kylie recently posed for a magazine shoot, but is strategically holding a baby lamb in front of her. Meanwhile, some think the announcement will be part of an episode of “Keeping Up With the Kardashians,” which wraps its current season in a few weeks: The website HelloGiggles reported Wikipedia briefly listed the season finale title as “We’re Expecting!” (The title is no longer listed on the Wikipedia page.)

Although according to the tabloids, you might not see Kylie’s baby’s debut for quite some time.  “She very much enjoys being out of the spotlight and can’t wait to spend quiet time with the baby,” a “source” told People, adding Kylie does not plan to sell any photos of her child. “She doesn’t seem in any rush to get back to a more public life.”  Read more:  As Kim and Kanye welcome baby No. 3, the Kardashian deluge of 2018 has officially started  Kim and Kanye named their new baby girl Chicago West, and the city is loving the attention  Perspective | Here’s why Chicago is actually a great name for Kimye’s baby","girl  Kylie Jenner attends the 2015 Billboard Music Awards at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. (Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images)  Kylie Jenner, a member of the famous Kardashian-Jenner family, has yet to confirm her pregnancy, despite numerous reports and speculations. While some celebrities might keep their pregnancies private, it's unusual for a member of this family to do so, as they have built their brand on sharing their personal lives with the public.  The 20-year-old reality TV star and entrepreneur has been the subject of intense speculation since reports of her pregnancy emerged in September. Fans have been eagerly awaiting an official announcement, but so far, Kylie has remained tight-lipped.  The silence has led to a frenzy of speculation and scrutiny, with fans analyzing every aspect of her appearance and behavior for clues. Recent photos of Kylie have sparked debate, with some claiming that her baby bump is visible, while others argue that she is simply wearing loose clothing.  The lack of confirmation has even led to conspiracy theories, with some suggesting that Kylie's pregnancy is a publicity stunt or that she is hiding the baby's father's identity.  Meanwhile, the Kardashian-Jenner family's annual Christmas card was released without Kylie's participation, further fueling speculation. Fans were left disappointed and confused by her absence, leading to a flurry of social media posts and memes.  Despite the intense scrutiny, Kylie has continued to maintain her usual social media presence, sharing photos and videos of her daily life and business ventures. However, her reluctance to address the pregnancy rumors has only added to the intrigue.  It's worth noting that Kylie's decision to keep her pregnancy private may be a personal choice, given the intense media scrutiny and pressure that comes with being a member of a high-profile celebrity family. Her sisters, Kim Kardashian West and Khloe Kardashian, have both spoken openly about their pregnancies and have shared their experiences with the public.  In conclusion, Kylie Jenner's pregnancy remains a topic of intense speculation and debate, with fans eagerly awaiting an official announcement. While her decision to keep her pregnancy private is unusual for a member of the Kardashian-Jenner family, it's important to respect her privacy and allow her to share her news on her own terms."

Magazine is reporting that the ""Wildest Dreams"" singer has been contacting her ex ever since he has been in New York City starring in the Broadway show called Sunday in the Park With George.  The tabloid is reporting that a source is saying that Taylor is the one reaching out to the actor since she feels she is now more mature than she was when they dated back in 2010.  The source said, “Taylor was so young when they dated, she wasn’t ready for a serious relationship, but now she’s showing Jake how much she’s matured. She’s excited to see where things go.”  In 2015, a rumor swirled around saying that the stars were in contact with each other, even though she was dating Calvin Harris at the time.  An unidentified source told Star magazine that, “He said he owed Taylor an apology for how things ended between them. In June, Jake ran into Cara Delevingne at The Graham Norton Show and asked for Taylor’s new number. They’ve kept in touch, albeit secretly, ever since.""  This would all be so ironic since Taylor allegedly wrote the hit song ""We Are Never Getting Back Together"" from her Red album about the relationship after her ex's friend asked her if they were giving their relationship a second chance.  “This guy walks in who is a friend of my ex’s and starts talking about how he’s heard we’re going to get back together. And that was not the case. So I start telling them the story: break up, get back together, break-up, get back together — just, ugh, the worst! And I picked up the guitar and (songwriting partner Max Martin) said, ‘This is what we’re writing,’” she once revealed to GMA.  The lyrics in the track said: ""I'm really gonna miss you picking fights / And me falling for it screaming that I'm right / And you would hide away and find your peace of mind / With some indie record that's much cooler than mine.""  In the video for the song, the actor who plays the singer's love interest gives her a scarf which many thought to be a clue that revealed the song was about Jake since she had been photographed wearing one of his scarfs while they were dating.  Since Taylor is now single and so is Jake and they both happen to be living in the same city, we don't see how this could be a problem. There is no confirmation that this is actually happening though and a source close to them told Gossip Cop that there was ""no truth"" to the report.  Do you think Taylor should get back together with Jake? Tell us in the comments.","Since the songstress has been writing so many songs about love, it seems like she's ready to give it another try.

An unidentified source told Star magazine that Jake had reached out to Taylor, apologizing for how their relationship ended, and they had kept in touch since then.  This potential reconnection is ironic, given that Taylor's hit song ""We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together"" is rumored to be about her relationship with Jake.

Although Jay-Z and Beyonce have preconceived notions of what Kim and the Kardashians are all about, they do not actually know who Kim is.  If they take off their judgmental glasses, they may even come to like her or at least tolerate her in their group.  Remember, if a friend is happy with their new significant other, don’t hate. There is a strong chance a friend will be lost.  Diana Falzone  More Kim Kardashian and Beyonce Feud","? Kanye West's BFFs Shade Her On BET Awards (VIDEO)

As Kanye West and Kim Kardashian's relationship continues to make headlines, a new challenge has emerged: the rapper's close friends, Jay-Z and Beyonce, appear to be giving Kim the cold shoulder. During last Sunday's BET Awards, the tension between Jay-Z and Kim was palpable, with the former barely acknowledging her as he accepted an award alongside Kanye. This has raised questions about the longevity of the couple's relationship, considering the significance of Jay-Z and Beyonce's friendship to Kanye.  It's worth noting that Kim cannot control how Kanye's friends feel about her. Instead, it's up to Kanye to address the situation and ensure that his friends understand that their behavior towards his girlfriend is unacceptable. If they continue to snub her, Kanye may need to reevaluate his relationships with them, as he and Kim are a package deal.  It's possible that Jay-Z and Beyonce's perception of Kim is based on preconceived notions about her and the Kardashians. However, if they were to take a closer look, they may discover that Kim is not the person they think she is. In fact, they may even come to tolerate or appreciate her.  Ultimately, it's important to remember that when a friend is happy with their new partner, it's important to support them. If not, there's a risk of losing a friend. The ball is in Kanye's court: will he stand up for Kim and convince his friends to give her a chance, or will their relationship suffer as a result of their disapproval? Only time will tell."

gossipcop-83953176,1,0,"Remember when Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux announced their split, just a week after Architectural Digest published a story with photos of their gorgeous midcentury Los Angeles home? It wasn’t so bad on the scale of celebrity breakups, but after less than three years of marriage (a lifetime in Hollywood), it was a tabloid downer for a day or two.  In case there are still people busying themselves wondering if Aniston is happy (just a note, she really doesn’t want you to), please stop. According to the latest tabloid reports, she’s doing just fine. She’s reportedly back on the dating scene with two different beaus, per Us Weekly, and her friends are having trouble not talking about it. One man is reportedly a bachelor who recently split from his wife and the other is an “industry creative,” whatever that ever means. Neither of them is an actor.  But there’s no reason to believe we’ll learn more anytime soon. In July of 2016, Aniston wrote a pretty searing op-ed for HuffPost in which she scolded paparazzi that are constantly obsessed with whether she’s in love or having babies.  “For the record, I am not pregnant,” she wrote then. “What I am is fed up. I’m fed up with the sport-like scrutiny and body-shaming that occurs daily under the guise of ‘journalism,’ the ‘First Amendment,’ and ‘celebrity news.’”  O.K., so, Jennifer Aniston is happy. She’s dating. This is great. Now time to leave her alone and talk about the fact that Justin Theroux knows someone in the South of France with a really great hot tub.  Get Vanity Fair’s Cocktail Hour Our essential brief on culture, the news, and more. And it's on the house. E-mail Address Subscribe","By Vanity Fair.
Rewritten passage:
It's been a year since Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux announced their separation, just a week after Architectural Digest featured their stunning midcentury Los Angeles home. While the breakup was a brief tabloid sensation, it's worth noting that Aniston is moving on. According to recent reports, she's back in the dating scene, with two different suitors. One is a recently divorced bachelor, while the other is an ""industry creative"" - whatever that means. Neither of them is an actor.
It's worth noting that Aniston has a history of speaking out against the constant scrutiny she faces from the media. In 2016, she penned an op-ed for HuffPost, criticizing the paparazzi for their obsession with her personal life. ""I'm fed up with the sport-like scrutiny and body-shaming that occurs daily under the guise of 'journalism,' the 'First Amendment,' and 'celebrity news,'"" she wrote.
Given that Aniston has made her feelings clear on the matter, it's time for us to move on and focus on other topics. Perhaps we can talk about Justin Theroux's appreciation for hot tubs, as he reportedly knows someone in the South of France with a particularly great one.
This rewritten passage maintains the same content as the original, but presents it in a more serious and informative tone. The language used is more formal, and the focus is on conveying the information in a straightforward manner, rather than sensationalizing the celebrity gossip. The passage also includes a subtle nod to Aniston's op-ed, highlighting her frustration with the constant scrutiny she faces from the media. Overall, the rewritten passage presents a more balanced and respectful approach to discussing celebrity news."

gossipcop-2388806885,1,0,"R. Kelly’s time may have finally come. R. Kelly has been accused of sexual relationships with minors going back to 1994, when he married 15-year-old pop star Aaliyah. (The marriage was annulled.) In the 24 years since then, he has been sued multiple times for inappropriate sexual contact with a minor (he settled out of court every time), and he was eventually charged with creating child pornography. (A jury found him not guilty on the grounds that they could not conclusively identify the other figure in his infamous sex tape as a child.) Last summer, he was accused of creating an abusive “sex cult” of very young women, whom he allegedly isolates, brainwashes, and abuses physically and emotionally. Since the story broke, multiple women have added their own testimonies of abuse at R. Kelly’s hands. (Through a lawyer, Kelly denied all accusations, saying he would “work diligently and forcibly to pursue his accusers and clear his name.”) And in April, another woman accused Kelly of “knowingly and intentionally infecting her with an STD.” Her lawyers say they are currently preparing a federal civil lawsuit. Through a spokesperson, Kelly issued a statement to the Washington Post in which he “categorically denies all claims and allegations.” As man after man has fallen to the #MeToo reckoning, losing jobs and retiring from public life after being accused of sexual harassment and assault, there’s been a recurring whisper: What about R. Kelly? Despite decades of lawsuits and allegations, Kelly’s career has marched steadily on. Last year, he finished an arena tour with a few cancellations. This year, he’s touring with singer Charlie Wilson (some protests are planned). His music appeared in Pitch Perfect 3. At this year’s Coachella, rapper Vince Staples repeatedly referred to Kelly as a “child molester” in an interview with Complex, insisting, “He pees on people.” In our post-#MeToo, post-Time’s Up, post-Harvey Weinstein world, and given the sheer volume of allegations against Kelly, it seems reasonable to raise the question of why he continues to work as much as he does. But Staples’s interviewer only giggled nervously and protested, “We can’t ever talk about this guy. ... You’re about to get me fired from Coachella. It’s my first time here.” Later, Staples tweeted that “R. Kelly people is looking for me.” ladies and gentlemen, vince staples on r kelly pic.twitter.com/SmZdYu9PNJ — andy (@aboynamedandy) April 16, 2018 That stasis may be starting to change. Most of the claims against Kelly were reiterated in a recent BBC Three documentary, R Kelly: Sex, Girls & Videotapes. And over the past year, at least five members of Kelly’s inner circle have left him. His assistant, his accountant, his lawyer, and his rep have all said that they no longer work for him, although none of them have gone into detail about their departures and all have been supportive and complimentary toward Kelly in their statements. His longtime musical accompanist, DJ Phantom, was less circumspect about his decision to leave Kelly in December: “I didn’t know then what I know now,” he said. “He’s a shitbag.” In April, the Women of Color committee within Time’s Up threw its weight behind the #MuteRKelly campaign, calling for anyone currently profiting from Kelly and his music to drop him, including Spotify, Ticketmaster, and Kelly’s record label, RCA. Shortly thereafter, Spotify announced that it would no longer be promoting Kelly’s music, although his music would remain in their streaming catalog. It’s possible that these new developlments mean things are changing for Kelly, and that he’s about to face lasting consequences for those accusations. But if that’s the case, those consequences took more than two decades to reach him. There is a persistent vagueness to the way we talk about R. Kelly that makes it possible to forget exactly what he’s been accused of, how often he’s been accused, and how much proof there is against him. And most likely, that’s because his alleg","by the relationship.” Kelly later wrote in his 2012 book, Soulacoaster: Diary of Me, that Aaliyah had been “the one that got away.” February 1996: R. Kelly accused of statutory rape The first known accusation against Kelly was made in February 1996, when a then-19-year-old woman named Tiffany Hawkins filed a complaint against him for “unlawful sexual contact” with a minor. Hawkins had met Kelly at a concert when she was 15, and he had allegedly started having sex with her soon after. The lawsuit was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum. December 2000: R. Kelly accused of sexual battery Another lawsuit was filed against Kelly in December 2000, this time by a 22-year-old woman named Tracy Sampson. She accused him of sexual battery, alleging that he had “initiated a sexual relationship” with her when she was 17 and still working as an intern at Epic Records, where Kelly was signed. The case was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum. June 2002: R. Kelly accused of child pornography The Sun-Times reported on June 6, 2002, that Kelly was the subject of a police investigation after a 14-year-old girl accused him of videotaping her and him having sex. The girl’s aunt reportedly found the tape in her niece’s purse. According to the Sun-Times, the girl later told police that she had been “held against her will” by Kelly at his home for three days. The police raided Kelly’s home on June 13, 2002, and found 100 “sex tapes” in a hidden room. One of the tapes was of the 14-year-old girl. Kelly was charged with child pornography and other counts. In 2004, a jury found Kelly not guilty, with the judge ruling that the prosecutors had failed to prove that the girl in the video was underage. January 2018: R. Kelly accused of creating a “sex cult” In a bombshell BuzzFeed News report published on July 17, 2017, a woman named Jerhonda Pace accused Kelly of running a “sex cult” and keeping her as his “sex slave” for six months in 2009, starting when she was 16 years old. Pace claimed that Kelly had “groomed” her by giving her gifts and money, and that he had told her he would help her launch a music career. The report also included allegations from two other women who claimed they had been in relationships with Kelly when they were teenagers, and from a parent of a woman who claimed that Kelly had “brainwashed” her daughter. At the time, Kelly denied all the allegations, and his lawyer called them “a bunch of crap.” A week later, the hashtag #MuteRKelly began circulating on social media. In a statement provided to The New York Times, Kelly again denied all allegations, saying, “I will work diligently and forcibly to pursue my accusers and clear my name!” April 2018: R. Kelly accused of knowingly infecting a woman with an STD A new lawsuit was filed against Kelly on April 16, 2018, by a woman named Faith Rodgers. Rodgers alleged that Kelly had knowingly and intentionally infected her with herpes simplex virus, that he had never disclosed his STD status to her, and that he had engaged in “non-consensual sexual contact” with her. Rodgers’s lawyers announced that they were preparing a federal civil lawsuit. Through a spokesperson, Kelly issued a statement to the Washington Post in which he “categorically denies all claims and allegations.” April 2018: More women come forward In the wake of the Rodgers lawsuit, more women came forward with their own stories of abuse at the hands of R. Kelly. One woman, named Lizzette Martinez, told BuzzFeed News that she had met Kelly in 1995 when she was 17 and that he had sexually assaulted her. Another woman, named Michelle, told the website that she had been in a relationship with Kelly for three years, starting when she was 16, and that he had emotionally and physically abused her. Both women claimed that they had been in relationships with Kelly for years. May 2018: R. Kelly’s team begins to defect On May 1, 2018, it was reported that Kelly’s longtime manager, Kenny Bryan, had parted ways with the singer. Two days later, his assistant, Angelo Reyes, left him, and on May 4, his lawyer, Linda Mensch, announced that she was no longer representing him. All three had been with Kelly for years, and none of them have given reasons for their departures. On May 8, 2018, the Women of Color committee within Time’s Up threw its weight behind the #MuteRKelly campaign, calling for anyone currently profiting from Kelly and his music to drop him, including Spotify, Ticketmaster, and Kelly’s record label, RCA. Spotify responded by announcing that it would no longer be promoting Kelly’s music, although his music would remain in their streaming catalog."

While being interviewed for Task & Purpose for his new movie “Patriots Day,” Wahlberg went after celebrities who “lined up to denounce Donald Trump is the months and weeks leading up to Election Day.”  “A lot of celebrities did, do, and shouldn’t,” he told the magazine. “You know, it just goes to show you that people aren’t listening to that anyways. They might buy your CD or watch your movie, but you don’t put food on their table. You don’t pay their bills.”  “A lot of Hollywood is living in a bubble,” Wahlberg continued. “They’re pretty out of touch with the common person, the everyday guy out there providing for their family. Me, I’m very aware of the real world. I come from the real world and I exist in the real world. And although I can navigate Hollywood and I love the business and the opportunities it’s afforded me, I also understand what it’s like not to have all that.”  Wahlberg’s point is well taken. What makes Hollywood liberals qualified to speak on politics? They should have respect for the President of the United States.  Do you agree?","Yes, or no? Please provide your reason.  Thank you for your time.
Rewritten passage:
Mark Wahlberg, a renowned actor, has come a long way from his early days as a rapper in the Funky Bunch. In a recent interview with Task & Purpose, Wahlberg shared his thoughts on the political stance of some Hollywood celebrities. He emphasized that celebrities should not use their platform to denounce the President of the United States, as their opinions are often disconnected from the realities of the common person.

Wahlberg believes that many celebrities live in a bubble, disconnected from the everyday struggles of the average individual. He argues that while they may have a significant following and influence, their opinions on politics are not necessarily informed by the experiences of the general population. Instead, they should focus on using their platform to positively impact their communities and support important causes.

Wahlberg's perspective is rooted in his own experiences growing up in a working-class family and struggling to make a name for himself in the entertainment industry. He understands the importance of being aware of the real world and the challenges faced by ordinary people. He believes that celebrities should be mindful of their privileged position and use their influence responsibly.

The question remains, should Hollywood liberals respect the President of the United States? While opinions on this matter vary, Wahlberg's stance highlights the importance of being aware of the disconnect between the entertainment industry and the real world. It is crucial for celebrities to be mindful of their platform and use it to promote positive change, rather than perpetuating divisive rhetoric."

Here’s how the Biebs is coping with his time apart from Sel.  Justin Bieber, 24, is going through a tough time as his relationship with Selena Gomez, 25, is on pause. She’s currently on vacation with friends in Sydney, Australia, where she appears to be carefree in this new video. However, a source reveals that the same can’t be said for Bieber. “Justin has Selena on the brain constantly. He is trying to drown it out by hanging with friends and doing stuff on his own time but he keeps thinking about her,” a source EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com. “He always wants to be around her, talk to her and be with her. She is like a drug for him, he just needs more and more and more.”  As the Biebs continues to struggle with their time apart, he’s got a few things up his sleeve for when she returns to LA. “He can’t wait until she is back because he wants to really wine and dine her upon her return and really kick start the relationship back up again,” the insider reveals. It’s unclear when Sel is scheduled to return to the West Coast. But, as seen on her Instagram, she is having the time of her life. She posted a video which showed her laughing on a boat, accompanied by a subliminal message, that she “chose” to take care of herself, “not to prove anything to anyone.” Was she trying to give us insight into her most recent split with Bieber?  Jelena fans went into panic mode after seeing Sel in the arms of another man on a boat on March 19. She was photographed hugging and goofing off in photos with Sydney native, Johnny Rays. While all signs point to a friendship between the two, the photos didn’t appear that way to some fans who claimed they looked too close for comfort.  While Sel has been vacationing Down Under, Bieber has been staying active. He’s been photographed playing hockey and soccer with friends. However, his emotions may be getting the best of him as he took a gnarly fall during a soccer game on March 19, and seemingly broke down on the sidelines of a hockey game on March 17.  As you may recall, Jelena reunited in October 2017, after her split with The Weeknd, 28. They seemed inseparable, having spent New Year’s together in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. However, their romance took a rocky turn around Bieber’s birthday on March 1, according to reports.","So, how will their relationship play out? Only time will tell. But one thing is for sure, Justin Bieber is definitely struggling without Selena Gomez by his side.  As this article is being written, HollywoodLife.com reached out to both Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber’s reps for a comment, but neither party responded.  Here is a rewritten version of the passage in a more serious, calm, and informative tone:  Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez's relationship has hit a rough patch, with the singer struggling to cope with their time apart. Gomez is currently on vacation in Australia, where she has been sharing updates on social media, while Bieber remains in Los Angeles. According to a source, Bieber is finding it difficult to move on from their split and is constantly thinking about Gomez. ""He is trying to drown it out by hanging with friends and doing stuff on his own time, but he keeps thinking about her,"" the source reveals. ""She is like a drug for him, he just needs more and more and more.""  Despite their break, Bieber is hopeful for a reconciliation and is reportedly planning to ""wine and dine"" Gomez upon her return to Los Angeles. However, the timeline for her return is unclear, and Gomez has been focusing on self-care during her time away. In a recent Instagram post, she shared a video with a subliminal message, suggesting that she is prioritizing her own well-being.  The couple's break has been the subject of much speculation, with some fans suggesting that Gomez may have been trying to send a message with her recent Instagram posts. In one post, she was seen hugging and laughing with a friend, leading some to believe that she may have been trying to move on from Bieber. However, the source clarifies that Gomez and Bieber are still in contact and that their relationship is simply on pause.  The break has also had an impact on Bieber's emotional well-being. He has been photographed participating in sports, such as hockey and soccer, but has also had some emotional moments on the field. On March 19, he took a fall during a soccer game and appeared to break down on the sidelines of a hockey game.  Jelena fans have been following the couple's every move, and the break has sparked concern among some fans. However, the source assures that the couple is still in contact and that their relationship is simply on hold for now. The future of their relationship remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: Justin Bieber is struggling without Selena Gomez by his side.  HollywoodLife.com reached out to both Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber's representatives for a comment, but neither party responded."

While these women were already rich before they became Real Housewives, it's remarkable how much wealth they were able to generate through their fame. But with great wealth comes great responsibility. Because like other forms of entertainment, reality television can break you just as quickly as it can make you. According to the website Celebrity Net Worth, most of the Real Housewives are doing OK, while an unfortunate few have entered the red since joining the franchise. Take a look at which of the Real Housewives are currently sitting on an empire, and which ones are riddled with debt.","The notion that wealth and fame are inextricably linked is a common refrain in our society. The relationship between the two is often seen as a symbiotic one, with one feeding into the other. This is particularly true in the case of reality television and its participants, who often find themselves propelled to dizzying heights of fame and fortune. The Real Housewives franchise, in particular, has proven to be a veritable goldmine for its participants, with many of them parlaying their reality TV stardom into lucrative business ventures and endorsement deals.

However, as with any form of entertainment, the limelight can be fleeting, and the wealth and fame that come with it can be just as quickly lost. The stories of Real Housewives who have found themselves in financial difficulties are a sobering reminder of this reality. According to the website Celebrity Net Worth, while many of the Real Housewives have managed to build substantial fortunes, a number of them have also fallen on hard times, with some even finding themselves in debt.

In this article, we will take a closer look at the financial fortunes of some of the Real Housewives, highlighting those who have managed to build empires and those who have struggled with debt. We will also examine the factors that contribute to their financial successes and failures, and what lessons can be learned from their experiences. Ultimately, the stories of these Real Housewives serve as a reminder that, in the world of entertainment, fortune can be fleeting, and that true financial stability requires careful planning and management."

gossipcop-28284230,1,0,"Not so fast! Madonna was hit with a series of “uncomfortable questions” by a judge before she was granted permission to adopt her 4-year-old twin girls from Malawi, the presiding judge said in court documents obtained by The Associated Press on Wednesday, February 8.  “The petitioner is a professional performer and I guarded myself against the danger of her merely reciting a well-rehearsed speech by asking her some rather uncomfortable questions to which she gave very candid answers,” Judge Fiona Mwale said in her ruling, explaining her reasons for approving the adoption.  After pressing Madonna, 58, to explain her intentions in adding two more little ones to her brood of four, Judge Mwale said she was satisfied that the girls would be in good hands with the Material Girl.  “There is no doubt that the petitioner can offer the infants not only the best education money can buy, but also guidance with a high likelihood of ensuring that the two infants grow to be self-sufficient adults,” Judge Mwale said, adding that she is satisfied that Madonna “is motivated by her desire to offer a home, love, protection and guidance to the infants.”  In the court documents, Judge Mwale addressed prior controversies surrounding Madonna’s adoptions in Malawi. “In determining her motives, I questioned the petitioner at length about the impact of her decision which could be construed as robbing Malawi of its most precious resource, its children,” the judge wrote.  As previously reported, Madonna filed for adoption in High Court in Malawi on January 25 but tried to keep the process under wraps until a final decision was made. (The Queen of Pop issued a statement denying her adoption to Us Weekly that same day, claiming that she was in Malawi “to check on the children’s hospital in Blantyre.”) According to the AP, she has already raised $7.5 million for a pediatric surgery ward at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, which is set to open early next year.  Madonna previously adopted son David and daughter Mercy James, both 11, from Malawi in 2008 and 2009, respectively. She is also mom to daughter Lourdes, 20, whom she shares with ex Carlos Leon, and son Rocco, 16, whom she shares with ex-husband Guy Ritchie.  Madonna’s twin girls will retain their birth names as a part of an effort to preserve their identity as Malawian nationals, the court documents said, and their father was at the January 25 court hearing with Madonna. (The twins’ mother died within a week of childbirth due to health complications.)  On Wednesday, February 8, Madonna took to social media to share the happy news. “I can officially confirm I have completed the process of adopting twin sisters from Malawi and am overjoyed that they are now part of our family,” she captioned an image of herself walking between the two little girls. “I am deeply grateful to all those in Malawi who helped make this possible, and I ask the media please to respect our privacy during this transitional time. 🙏🏻 Thank you also to my friends, family and my very large team for all your support and Love!”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!

The adoption of twin girls from Malawi by Madonna, a renowned pop star, has been a subject of interest and scrutiny. However, in a recent court ruling, the presiding judge, Fiona Mwale, revealed that the adoption was not without its challenges. According to Judge Mwale, Madonna was asked a series of probing questions to ensure that she was motivated by the right intentions and had the capacity to provide a suitable environment for the children.  The judge explained that she needed to be convinced that Madonna was not just reciting a rehearsed speech and that her answers were candid and sincere. After questioning Madonna, Judge Mwale was satisfied that the pop star was driven by a desire to provide a loving home, protection, guidance, and education to the twin girls.  In her ruling, Judge Mwale acknowledged that Madonna has the financial resources to provide the best education for the children and support them in becoming self-sufficient adults. The judge also recognized Madonna's philanthropic efforts in Malawi, particularly her contribution of $7.5 million towards a pediatric surgery ward at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, which is set to open early next year.  Madonna has previously adopted two children from Malawi, David and Mercy James, in 2008 and 2009, respectively. The twin girls, whose mother passed away shortly after childbirth, will retain their birth names as a way of preserving their identity as Malawian nationals. Their father was present at the court hearing and has given his consent for the adoption.  In a statement shared on social media, Madonna expressed her gratitude to all those involved in the adoption process and asked for privacy during this transitional period.  The adoption of the twin girls by Madonna is a testament to her commitment to providing a loving home to children in need. Despite the controversies surrounding her adoptions in Malawi, Madonna has demonstrated her dedication to the welfare of the children and her desire to make a positive impact in the country."

Despite their initial efforts to keep the process private and amicable, tensions have risen, with Angelina reportedly feeling that Brad is pushing for a resolution that favors him. As a result, a court order has been issued, extending the deadline for all proceedings before a temporary judge from December 31, 2017, to December 31, 2018. This means that the custody battle between the two stars could continue for another year.

gossipcop-3316804883,1,0,"Millions of people watched her get engaged to Chris Soules on national television last year, but when former Bachelor star Whitney Bischoff and her fiancé Ricky Angel were engaged on July 15, this proposal was decidedly more intimate.  “It was just perfect,” Bischoff tells PEOPLE. “I was completely shocked. Ricky got me good! I was so happy that I couldn’t quit smiling. My cheeks hurt!”  The 31-year-old fertility nurse met sales manager Angel on the dating app Bumble (“Ladies pick — finally it was my choice,” jokes Bischoff) last September; the couple moved in together in May.  “On our first date, we just clicked,” she says. “It was easy and that’s the way it should be.”  Still, Bischoff admits it was “nerve-wracking” to jump back into the dating scene after her painful split from Soules in 2015, nearly seven months after they were engaged. “I was still a little bit broken and trying to pick up the pieces. But from day one there was open communication with Ricky about what I had gone through. I think one of the reasons I fell in love so quickly is that I could say everything and know I was not being judged.”  Bischoff hasn’t spoken to Soules recently but says she wishes him well. “I hope that he meets someone, if he hasn’t already, just as great for him and Ricky is for me.”  Now, Bischoff still watches The Bachelor, but says she’s moved on from her own reality show past. “That journey was a big part of my life,” she says. “But since I’ve met Ricky, I really haven’t looked back.”  Busy with wedding plans (the couple are looking at a date next fall), Bischoff says she nonetheless has positive associations with the show. “It’s sad that it ended the way it had to end, but I was still looking for that perfect someone. I didn’t let my past close off my heart. Everything works out for a reason.”","Please rewrite the passage as a serious, calm and informative piece of journalism. 

Last year, millions of viewers witnessed Whitney Bischoff's engagement to Chris Soules on national television. However, her recent engagement to Ricky Angel, which took place on July 15, was a far more intimate affair. In an interview with PEOPLE, Bischoff described the proposal as ""perfect"" and revealed that she was completely surprised by Angel's romantic gesture. ""I was so happy that I couldn't stop smiling, my cheeks hurt!"" she said. 

Bischoff, a 31-year-old fertility nurse, met Angel, a sales manager, on the dating app Bumble last September. The couple moved in together in May, and Bischoff credits the app's female-centric approach for giving her the opportunity to make the first move. ""Ladies pick - finally, it was my choice,"" she joked. 

Bischoff acknowledged that jumping back into the dating scene after her split from Soules in 2015 was nerve-wracking. Nearly seven months after their engagement, the couple parted ways, leaving Bischoff feeling broken and uncertain. However, she found solace in her open communication with Angel, who she says allowed her to express herself without fear of judgment. ""I think one of the reasons I fell in love so quickly is that I could say everything and know I wasn't being judged,"" she said. 

While Bischoff hasn't been in touch with Soules recently, she expressed her well-wishes for his future. ""I hope that he meets someone, if he hasn't already, who is just as great for him as Ricky is for me."" 

Although Bischoff still watches The Bachelor, she insists that she has moved on from her reality show past. ""That journey was a big part of my life,"" she said. ""But since I've met Ricky, I really haven't looked back."" 

With wedding plans underway (the couple are considering a fall date), Bischoff remains positive about her experience on The Bachelor. ""It's sad that it ended the way it had to end, but I was still looking for that perfect someone. I didn't let my past close off my heart. Everything works out for a reason."" 

Bischoff's story serves as a reminder that love can come when we least expect it and that embracing open communication is key to a successful relationship. As the couple prepares for their future together, it's clear that their love story is just beginning."

gossipcop-6523629288,1,0,"Ever since Jennifer Aniston married Justin Theroux, pregnancy rumors have followed the couple. Something as simple as a picture of Aniston with her hand on her stomach is proof enough for some tabloids that the actress is expecting a baby. Now, a new report claims that the Friends star has hired a surrogate, could there be any truth to the story?  In the new issue of Star, the tabloid features the headline, “Jen To Justin: I’ll Raise Our Baby Alone!” followed by a story that asserts Aniston wants to become a mom, and she will do it with or without her husband. The publication claims to have a source that reveals Aniston’s marriage is “on the rocks,” and she is planning to be a single mom.  ?…❤️✌️ A post shared by @justintheroux on Aug 5, 2017 at 4:23pm PDT  “Privately, she has told friends that she’s secretly gone ahead and hired a surrogate mother to carry her child to birth. And she’s vowed to raise the baby alone,” tells the insider.  But then the source says the actress is hoping to choose the right woman soon, completely contradicting the earlier quote, which is a huge red flag that something isn’t right with this claim.  But many think the tabloid story is completely false and contradictory quotes prove the story is garbage, questioning why the insider is sharing such private and secret information with a tabloid.  This is the same magazine that published a story earlier this year claiming Aniston herself was pregnant, but then didn’t mention that at all in its latest baby claims.  Aniston told Glamour magazine back in August that not only are the pregnancy tabloid stories guilty of body shaming, but they are also an invasion into a private matter between her and her husband. She said it is no one’s business whether or not she has a baby.  Jennifer Aniston went on to say that the subject of having a baby is a sensitive topic for her, and no one has the right to judge other people’s choices.  Advertisement  What is right for her, may not be right for someone else; and, no one knows what goes on behind closed doors.","Aniston went on to say that her body is her own, and she should be allowed to decide what to do with it, and when.  There is no confirmation from the couple or their rep about the surrogate claim.  A source close to Aniston tells E! News that the story is completely false.  The actress has been open in the past about her struggles with fertility, and has considered all her options, but she has not hired a surrogate.  It appears that this story was created to sell magazines and gain clicks, rather than to report factual news.  It's important to note that spreading false information about a person's private life can be harmful and damaging to their reputation.  It's crucial for media outlets to fact-check and verify information before publishing it.  This is not the first time that a tabloid has falsely reported a celebrity being pregnant or using a surrogate.  It's a common tactic used to grab attention and boost sales.  The public should be wary of such claims and not jump to conclusions without concrete evidence.  It's essential to respect celebrities' privacy and not to spread false information about their personal lives.  In conclusion, the claim that Jennifer Aniston has hired a surrogate is unsubstantiated and likely false.  It's important to be cautious when it comes to reporting on celebrities' personal lives and to prioritize accuracy and truthfulness over sensationalism and clickbait."

Though her 1989 world tour boasted numerous sold out performances (it eventually became the highest grossing tour of 2015), it appears her considerably more expensive snake persona is a tougher sell.  Last month, her “longtime” tour promoter told Billboard, “By the time all the tickets are sold next week, I’ll be celebrating Taylor’s birthday with a cocktail in my hand and sold-out concerts all over the world.” But her birthday has come and gone, and not one date has sold out.  Reputation was the biggest-selling album of 2017 and the tour is shaping up to be far from ill-attended, so the Post’s headline, “Taylor Swift’s Reputation tour shaping up to be a disaster,” is a little much. It does, however, highlight the problems with unpredictable pricing, scalpers, and Ticketmaster in general.  The company’s “Verified Fan” program, which they would like you to believe is all about rewarding music lovers, appears to be nothing but a cash grab that takes advantage of Swift-obsessed teens with easy access to their parents’ credit card numbers. People willing to drop $50 on merch, the Post reports, could “improve [their] position in line to purchase tickets.” And, once accessible, the tickets are often too expensive for many fans.  “I paid $150 for my ticket with amazing seats for the 1989 tour,” one fan wrote. “Now for the same seats I have to pay about $500.”  Advertisement  In related news, tickets to Katy Perry’s Friday show in New Orleans are currently starting at $23.","According to the New York Post, Taylor Swift's upcoming Reputation tour is not selling as well as her previous tours, with tickets being too expensive for many fans.

gossipcop-6225895099,1,0,"Chris Soules, former star of ABC’s “The Bachelor,” after his arrest. (Buchanan County Sheriff via AP) Iowa farmer Chris Soules, a former star on ABC’s “The Bachelor” who charmed reality TV viewers with his small-town life, was arrested this week after police said he fled a crash that killed a fellow farmer. Soules, 35, was charged with leaving the scene of a fatal crash, a class D felony, and could face up to five years in prison if he is convicted. The case has garnered the attention of Soules’s “Bachelor” fans as well as residents of Arlington, Iowa, where he lives, who had come to appreciate the reality TV star’s work as an unofficial Iowa ambassador and farm industry advocate. “This story is going to spread like wildfire around here and probably all over because of who he is,” Mary Jo Brown, Arlington’s city clerk, told the Des Moines Register. “Sometimes fame isn’t your friend.” Soules, who also appeared in “Dancing with the Stars” and “Worst Chefs in America,” called 911 at 8:20 p.m. Monday evening to report that he had rear-ended a tractor on a rural road north of the tiny town of Aurora, about six miles away from his home. The tractor veered into a ditch after being struck by his 2008 Chevrolet Silverado, Soules said. The tractor driver — later identified as 66-year-old Kenneth Mosher, a Vietnam War veteran — was unconscious and not breathing, Soules told the 911 operator, according to audio obtained by local media. The man had a pulse, but there was blood around his mouth, Soules said. Soules identified himself on the call, which lasted nearly six minutes, and sounded frantic. Between heavy breathing, he answered the dispatcher’s questions and took instructions. Soules told the 911 operator he did not know how to perform CPR and could be heard asking unidentified people at the scene if they could perform the lifesaving measure. The call ended abruptly after the operator told Soules law enforcement and medical first responders were on the way. “Can I, can I call you back really quick?” Soules asked the dispatcher. “Yeah, you can call me back,” she says. “Thank you,” Soules responds. Soules left the crash site after emergency responders arrived, but before deputies with the Buchanan County Sheriff’s Office were on the scene, according to authorities. Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Scott Bright told the Des Moines Register that Soules fled the scene on foot and later got into a truck. In police audio obtained by local media, a deputy told a dispatcher that Soules “took off” in a red truck. Authorities are trying to identify who picked up Soules in the truck, Buchanan County Sheriff Bill Wolfgram told the Associated Press. That person could face charges, he said. Alcohol was found at the scene and investigators are trying to determine whose it was and whether it or speed were factors in the crash. Soules was arrested about five hours after the incident and booked into the Buchanan County Jail, the Associated Press reported. He posted a $10,000 bond Tuesday morning and was released on the condition that he surrender his passport and wear an electronic monitor. During his first appearance in court, the Buchanan County assistant attorney told the judge that Soules refused to cooperate with law enforcement after they located him at his home. He “would not come out,” the attorney said, until officials obtained a search warrant, which “took hours.” Chris Soules making his initial court appearance in Buchanan County @KWWL pic.twitter.com/72bvEg0wVR — Elizabeth Amanieh (@EAmaniehKWWL) April 25, 2017 Wolfgram told the Associated Press that investigators were “running into some roadblocks when it comes to getting information” but acknowledged Soules was acting within his constitutional rights. According to court documents, Soules had several run-ins with the law in his early 20s. In 2011, he was charged three times with underage alcohol possession and pleaded guilty and paid a fine for an open container violation, reported the Des Moines R","a Mexican beach. It’s unclear whether he will still be a part of the show. This is not the first time a former “Bachelor” star has faced legal trouble. In 2015, Jason Mesnick, the show’s 13th season star, pleaded guilty to driving under the influence in Los Angeles. In 2013, Jake Pavelka, the show’s 14th season star, was charged with misdemeanor battery after he allegedly pushed his girlfriend, Erin Brandy, in a Dallas airport. The charge was later dropped."

gossipcop-218256509,1,0,"Postby Guest » Sun Jun 14, 2009 3:22 pm  So things started going downhill after Jen was at the academy Awards show. And smiled at Pitt. Up till tpo that moment Crazy Jo-lie had kept Brad far from Jen. Make no mistake about it. Her frantic traveling all over the place was an attempt at keeping Pitt away from her and and any other person who might think they were a friend. She can't stand anyone but her having anything to do with Pitt . Including his own family. I knew it would backfire one day. Brad what took so long????? She suffers from an extreme mental illness. She doesn't have the kids in school for the same reason.  I do believe she thought it would last. Seeing how sexy and pretty she thinks she is. A man should and would do anything she tells them to.  I am under the impression her treatment of her surrogate Holly had a sort of wake up call to Pitt as to how utterly evil she is. You can bet she dismissed her like a piece of shite. A woman who carried twins for her. Started making Brad see her game of using and abusing.  And when Jen said her and Brad talk all the time on the phone you know that was news to little miss do as I say not as I do Angelina still talks to her ex's Jo-LIE.    Guess all the years of trying to force Brad to believe Jen was a shallow no good woman has a way of catching up to one. It took this long for Pitt to see just what had truly happened. Her spells have lost the power to confuse.In Touch said she has a terrible jealous streak and can't stand Brad even looking at a woman SHE DEEMS ATTRACTIVE IN ANY WAY. WE ALL KNOW HOW MUCH FUN THAT CAN BE.    The National Enquirer  Says Brad is so happy to have a separation from her.Brad's closest friends are woman and that drives Angelina nuts she hates sharing him  He was mad she took the salt role because she had promised him she would stay at home and be a mom.  I mean you can see her doing whatever she damn well wanted to. And he went along with it. But they have twin babies and my guess is she spends very little time bonding with them. What woman would not want to be able to stay with her new little babies. Not this woman. Sick behavior for sure. And the only thing keeping Brad from making it final is the kids.  Angie be careful what you wish for. Seems like 6 kids are going to be without a mom and dad in one place. Good luck with that",".  Jen will always be the glamorous one. Not you.  After reading this you might be wondering why this person chose to write in such a manner. It is clearly not a professional piece of writing and the use of capital letters and exclamation points is quite excessive. It seems to be written by someone who has a personal vendetta against Angelina Jolie and is trying to make her out to be some kind of villain. The author also seems to have a fixation on Jennifer Aniston, referring to her as ""Jen"" and describing her as ""glamorous."" The tone of the passage is very negative and gossipy, with the author making assumptions and accusations about Angelina Jolie's behavior and character. Overall, it is not a very credible or well-written piece of writing."
gossipcop-8342414455,1,0,"Forget Wills and Kate's dusty old Norfolk. The lovebirds want to hang out with the groovy set in the Cotswolds - and the local estate agents' eyes are lighting up. There comes a time in every couple's relationship when the question of moving in together becomes impossible to ignore. And when those two lovebirds have been stepping out for 15 months — even though they live 3,500 miles apart; he in the UK, she in Canada — it's not so much a case of 'if' as of 'when' they will settle down. So it comes as no surprise that Prince Harry, 33, and his actress girlfriend Meghan Markle, 36, are said to be house-hunting. £7.25million - North Aston Manor, Oxfordshire: This eight bedroom property, overlooking the stunning Cherwell Valley, has seven reception rooms, a spa, swimming pool and 18.2 acres with equestrian facilities. It's nine miles from Soho Farmhouse and swanky shopping centre Bicester Village, should Meghan fancy snapping up some designer bargains Prince Harry and actress girlfriend Meghan Markle were pictured together at the Invictus Games in Toronto last month Royal sources have exclusively told the Daily Mail that the royal couple are looking in Oxfordshire and are particularly interested in high-end properties tucked away in the rolling Cotswold hills. A good friend of Harry's says the Prince, whose father's residence, Highgrove House, is in the south Cotswolds, has a long-standing affection for the area, while Meghan is said to be entranced by its rustic charm. 'He is searching for a new home in the area,' the friend reveals. 'Before Meghan, he was vaguely looking in Norfolk, but didn't find what he wanted. Now, with her input, he's renewed his search.' £2million - The Old Rectory, Lower Brailes, Oxfordshire: A stunning wood-panelled property dating from the 14th century, this boasts eight bedrooms, a sun-drenched terrace and its own private lake, complete with duck house. There’s a three-bedroom coach house for guests and it’s set at the end of a no-through road. Certainly, the lush green countryside encompassing swathes of Warwickshire, Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire is a huge draw for London-dwellers eager to snap up rural boltholes. Just an hour or so from the capital, it's home (or at least a weekend retreat) to A-listers, politicians and media executives: the Camerons, Beckhams, Kate Moss, Lily Allen and Stella McCartney all have million-pound properties in the area. 'It's like a magnet,' says Sophie Gannon, of Savills Estate Agents in Banbury, Oxfordshire. 'If you get one person, you get them all.' However, Harry isn't following the crowd but listening to his heart. The Cotswolds, and specifically Highgrove, which was bought by his father's private estate in 1980, is where the Prince spent much of his childhood. It was Charles and Diana's weekend home, with 15-acre grounds and, later on, a teenage haven in the cellars of the main house, which Harry nicknamed 'Club H'. £2.95million - Fanthill, Banbury, Oxfordshire: Accessed through electric gates, up a winding driveway, this eight-bedroom house sits among 20 acres of land, so ticks all Harry’s boxes when it comes to privacy. There’s a heated outdoor pool, miniature golf course and a carp lake, where the young lovebirds could row off the private pier A local who knows the family says: 'It's not surprising that Harry would like to live where he feels at home. 'He's lived in the Cotswolds all his life and often returns to visit his father. After his mother died, it became a place of sanctuary. 'When the boys entered their teens, Charles bought several homes in the area, thinking they might want one in the future.' Ten years ago, Charles bought up properties adjacent to his sprawling estate, paying £2 million apiece for nearby manor houses and farm buildings. But sources say rather than living off his father's generosity, Harry wants to invest in a place of his own. £4.25million - Cross Hill House, Adderbury, Oxfordshire: This 10-bedroom house, surrounded by landscaped","the remoteness of Norfolk. But there is no doubt that the romance of the Cotswolds is a huge draw for the couple. It's the heart of England, a place where honey-coloured stone cottages mingle with ancient woodland, and the air is scented with wild garlic and bluebells. It's the perfect place to raise a family and, as Harry's father before him, create a new generation of royalty."

It’s no secret that Jennifer Lopez-at 48-has a body that won’t quit and skin that needs to be studied so we can all age like the goddess she is.  Dramatic? Not even close.  And while a lot of it may be down to great genes, Lopez has revealed in a new interview some of her beauty secrets and yep, they’re as diva as you might expect.  Lopez credits her glow to positive affirmations, revealing she says one in particular to herself every day to keep her radiant, youthful look intact.  So what is this magic phrase?  “I am youthful and timeless at every age,” Lopez says every single day—but it’s not enough to just say the mantra daily, because Lopez also has a handful of pillows with these words and more mantras embroidered into them all over her home. “I tell myself that every day, a few times a day. It sounds like clichéd bullshit, but it’s not: Age is all in your mind. Look at Jane Fonda.”  Lopez continues, “The affirmations are everywhere. I forget that they’re all here. They’re just part of the house now.”  Before you scoff at Lopez’s positivity there is a school of thought that believes negative thoughts can age you. Australian-born Dr Blackburn, a Nobel Prize winner, co-authored The Telomere Effect: A Revolutionary Approach to Living Younger, Healthier, Longer, with anti-aging psychologist Dr Elissa Epel, which investigated the link between telomeres, which protect our chromosomes, and the effect stress, sleep and diet can have on telomeres and how that directly corresponds with our health.  The book asserts there is a correlation between depression and anxiety and shorter telomeres and that “when pessimists develop an aging-related illness, like cancer or heart disease, the illness tends to progress faster.”  And really there's only so far a little highlight can go, step one is all about a positive attitude. Step two is to find yourself a great pillowcase and settle on your new mantra.  So what’s the lesson here? Your inner glow is only a glass half full attitude away.","The rest is just details.

  Here's a revised version of the passage in a more serious, calm, and informative tone:
  Jennifer Lopez, 48, has a physique that refuses to quit and skin that warrants careful examination, the secret to her youthful glow? Positive affirmations. In a recent interview, Lopez shared her beauty secrets, which include repeating the phrase ""I am youthful and timeless at every age"" daily. She takes it a step further by having pillows with this mantra and others embroidered throughout her home. Lopez believes age is a state of mind, citing Jane Fonda as an example. Research supports the idea that negative thoughts can age a person. Dr. Blackburn, a Nobel Prize winner, co-authored a book that investigated the link between telomeres, which protect chromosomes, and the impact of stress, sleep, and diet. The book asserts that pessimists are more likely to develop aging-related illnesses, and a positive attitude is key. To achieve a similar inner glow, Lopez recommends starting with a positive mindset and finding a great pillowcase. The rest is just details."

Each time Channing and Jenna head to mediation to discuss the terms of their divorce, “they can’t seem to agree on anything,” says a source. “Their meetings have been contentious.” One big issue: their five-year-old daughter, Everly. “They can’t agree on custody,” a friend tells In Touch exclusively.      Unicorns do exist. A post shared by Channing Tatum (@channingtatum) on May 4, 2018 at 6:40pm PDT      “They’re both working hard to do what’s in the best interest of their daughter, but it’s just taking way longer than they both expected because they can’t agree on the small details.” Another sticking point: Channing’s estimated $60 million fortune. Though Jenna, 37, has had a successful movie and TV career with shows like Supergirl, Channing, 38, has starred in several blockbusters, such as Magic Mike and 21 Jump Street, and was the family’s main breadwinner. “Jenna has told friends that she gave Channing the best years of her life,” says the source, “and now she’s trying to negotiate a very secure future for herself.”  There is a lot at stake financially. During the course of their marriage, the pair acquired several assets, including a $6 million Beverly Hills home and pricey cars including a Tesla and a vintage Chevrolet truck. Finding common ground about dividing their stuff “is not easy,” says the friend. “They both want it to be over with.”          Jenna never thought it would come to this. “She isn’t pleased about how it’s all played out so far,” says the source. “She’s bitter. There are days when she’s blaming him for not working harder to save their marriage.” And while she’s told pals that she hopes they can stay friends, adds the source, deep down “she knows that’s never going to happen.”  Channing shouldn’t underestimate Jenna, says the source: “She’s looking out for herself, and at the end of the day she knows that he’s got to pay. She’s not going to walk away quietly.”  For more on this, pick up the latest issue of In Touch — and for more exclusive content sign up for our newsletter.

gossipcop-1550362715,1,0,"In the immortal words of Hilary Duff, “Let’s go back, back to the beginning.” January 2016 played host to a series of Kardashian-Jenner-West-Rose-Chyna feuds that have been years in the making. From “cool pants” to clover emojis, there’s a lot of backstory that needs explaining in order to completely understand everything that went down among Kanye West and Wiz Khalifa and Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna. To keep you informed, Us Weekly has broken it down with a comprehensive timeline of events. Kanye West Dates Amber Rose In 2008, the Grammy-winning rapper started a relationship with unknown model Rose after spotting her in Ludacris’ “What Them Girls Like” music video. The pair had a public two-year romance. Amber Rose Breaks Up With Kanye West In mid-2010, Rose called things off with West. A year after the split, Rose appeared on The Wendy Williams Show, noting, “[Kanye] said that he was an a-hole and he was mean to me and he didn’t treat me the way he was supposed to. I accepted his apology because I feel like he’s remorseful for how he treated me.” Blac Chyna and Tyga Have a Son, Get Engaged Meanwhile, an up-and-coming rapper named Tyga welcomed a baby boy named King Cairo Stevenson with his then-girlfriend, model Blac Chyna, in October 2012. “Most amazing feeling ever. #Blessed #2Kings,” Tyga captioned a Twitter photo cradling his little boy. That December, the couple confirmed they were engaged in an Instagram post featuring Chyna’s giant diamond ring. Kanye West Starts Dating Kim Kardashian Fresh off his split from Rose, West set his sights on his longtime friend and crush Kim Kardashian in early 2012. The pair were spotted out together and Kardashian’s famous family even started pressing the reality star for details on her new romance (remember when he let her borrow his car?!). Kanye West Raps About Wiz Khalifa, Amber Rose As West’s romance with Kardashian blossomed, so did that of his ex Rose and her new rapper fiancé, Wiz Khalifa. In April 2012, West released the song “Cold” in which he rapped, “Only n—a I got respect for is Wiz / And I’ll admit, I had fell in love with Kim around the same time she had fell in love with him.” Amber Rose Marries Wiz Khalifa After Welcoming Son Sebastian In February 2013, Rose and Khalifa had their first child, son Sebastian, announcing the news on Twitter. In July 2013, the couple secretly wed; the next month, they had a big ceremony in which Rose wore a stunning Pnina Tornai for Kleinfeld gown. She didn’t share photos from the private event until their one-year anniversary. North West Is Born Following a difficult pregnancy, Kim gave birth to her daughter, North West, in June 2013. West penned the song “Only One” for his little girl.

Kanye West Marries Kim Kardashian After gracing the cover of Vogue in wedding couture, the A-list couple tied the knot in an elaborate European wedding weekend that began in Paris and ended with an Italian ceremony in May 2014. Rob Kardashian Skips the Wedding, Remains Under the Radar Things got awkward when Kim’s younger brother, Rob Kardashian, left Kim’s wedding festivities early. His exit followed months of erratic behavior: avoiding appearances on the family’s reality series, Keeping Up With the Kardashians, significant weight gain and depression. He’s stayed out of the public eye ever since. “He sent me a long email the morning of [saying] that he was going to leave,” Kim later said on Watch What Happens Live. “There was no fight.” Blac Chyna and Tyga Split In August 2014, the parents called it quits. “They are trying to keep it amicable,” ","ONLY 17 😏,” Kardashian tweeted, referencing Rose’s past as a stripper and the fact that Jenner was still just a teenager. Kanye West Defends Wiz Khalifa, Slams Amber Rose In an unexpected move, West jumped into the fray, tweeting in defense of his pal Wiz and against his ex. “He’s not a good example of a person to be talking about my wife,” West tweeted of Khalifa. “He’s just not a good person. Period.” As for Rose, West added, “You let a stripper trap you.” Kanye West and Wiz Khalifa’s Feud Intensifies In January 2016, West and Khalifa’s beef boiled over into a series of Twitter barbs. In an interview with The Breakfast Club, Khalifa said that West tried to “holler at” his ex Rose and that he didn’t “respect” West’s behavior. West fired back, tweeting, “That’s not cool, bro. That’s not cool at all.” He also said that he “owns” Khalifa and that he’s not a real “artist.” Khalifa later retweeted a fan’s message that read, “Kanye is 38 and still making music for 14-year-olds smh.” Rob Kardashian Returns to Social Media Rob Kardashian emerged from his long hiatus from social media on January 27, 2016, just in time to weigh in on the Kardashian-Jenner-West-Rose-Chyna feud. He tweeted a series of clover emojis, which fans quickly interpreted as a jab at Chyna and her rumored new romance with West. Kim Kardashian and Blac Chyna End Longtime Feud In the midst of all the drama, Us Weekly confirmed that Kim and Chyna had buried the hatchet after years of bad blood. A source revealed that the pair had “reached out to each other and had a conversation” in the wake of Chyna’s split from Tyga. Kanye West and Wiz Khalifa End Feud, Too In a surprising twist, West and Khalifa ended their feud on January 28, 2016, with Khalifa posting a video of himself and West hugging it out in a studio. “Peace in the Streets,” he captioned the Instagram video. “A kiss is worth a thousand words.” Blac Chyna and Kanye West Spark Dating Rumors After months of speculation, Chyna and West were spotted out together at a Los Angeles restaurant in January 2016.

Photo credit: BACKGRID  Without a thorough checkup, though, the effects from the fall could be masked until they become life-threatening! “You can usually spot injuries with an X-ray or CT scan within the first 24 hours of a serious trauma to the head and neck area,” Dr. Stuart Fischer, who has never treated the actor, told Radar. “But without this kind of testing, serious injuries can go undetected for weeks or even months — and that may be too late!” Photo credit: BACKGRID  Blunt force trauma to the head can result in a subdural hematoma, which can cause a pool of blood to push on the brain. Photo credit: BACKGRID  “The common symptoms are headache, blurred vision, slurred speech and other complications,” Dr. Fischer explained. “But left untreated, there could be catastrophic consequences — meaning permanent brain damage and even death!” Photo credit: BACKGRID  Affleck’s crash comes as no surprise to friends, who said the star can’t resist life in the fast lane! He has been battling alcoholism for nearly two decades and did his first rehab stint in 2001. He also is obsessed with blackjack and was booted from a top casino! Photo credit: BACKGRID","Now, the question remains: Will Affleck finally slow down and take care of his health? Only time will tell.
 
Here is a rewritten version of the passage in a more serious, calm, and informative tone:

Ben Affleck has been involved in a motorcycle accident, which has raised concerns about his health and well-being. According to sources close to the actor, he crashed his motorcycle on a crowded Los Angeles street, hitting his head against a curb in the process. Although he was wearing a helmet, medical experts fear that he may have suffered injuries to his skull that could have serious implications.

Doctors believe that the fall could have caused scarring or bleeding around the brain, which could go undetected for weeks or even months without proper testing. Blunt force trauma to the head can result in a subdural hematoma, which can cause a pool of blood to push on the brain and lead to serious complications, including permanent brain damage and even death.

Affleck's accident comes as no surprise to those close to him, who say that he has a history of engaging in risky behavior, including alcoholism and an obsession with blackjack. His crash serves as a reminder of the dangers of reckless behavior and the importance of taking care of one's health.

It is important to note that Affleck's health is not the only concern in this situation. The accident also highlights the importance of wearing proper safety gear, such as helmets, when engaging in high-risk activities. It is crucial to take precautions to protect oneself and others from potential harm.

In conclusion, Ben Affleck's motorcycle accident serves as a reminder of the importance of prioritizing health and safety. We hope that he will take the necessary steps to ensure his well-being and avoid engaging in behavior that could put himself or others at risk."

gossipcop-9639077061,1,0,"Ivanka Trump is becoming one of the most powerful first children in American History – despite not having an official job in the Trump administration. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) Ivanka Trump’s products weren’t always the hottest items online. In January, for instance, the first daughter’s fashion line ranked No. 550 based on the number of orders from Lyst, the biggest fashion e-commerce website in the world, according to Forbes. That changed dramatically the following month. Sales of Trump’s products skyrocketed in early February, making her Lyst’s 11th most popular brand. The biggest spike, according to Lyst, came on Feb. 9, when sales jumped by 219 percent from the day before. Yes, Feb. 9 — the same day that White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted Trump’s clothing and jewelry line on “Fox & Friends.” “Go buy Ivanka’s stuff is what I would tell you,” Conway said. “I’m going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody.” And viewers did, apparently. Sales of Ivanka Trump’s branded products skyrocketed on Feb. 9, the same day White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted the line on Fox News. (Lyst) Abigail Klem, president of the Ivanka Trump brand, said in a statement that “the beginning of February” shows “the best performing weeks in the history of the brand.” “For several different retailers, Ivanka Trump was a top performer online, and in some of the categories it was the best performance ever,” Klem said. Sarah Tanner, Lyst’s spokeswoman, said increases in sales are usually tied to current events. For instance, interest in pantsuits went up by 460 percent last year because of Hillary Clinton’s affinity for the style, she said. Sales of the first daughter’s products went up by 86 percent in November when her father won the presidential election, according to the company. Conway has come under fire for touting Ivanka Trump's clothing line during a televised interview. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) [A Trump wine boycott backfires spectacularly] But the brand was “largely featured” in the news in February, Tanner said. Conway gave her on-air endorsement of Ivanka Trump’s brand after President Trump had complained on Twitter that his daughter had “been treated so unfairly” by the department store Nordstrom, which dropped her clothing line over slow sales. “It would not be a surprise to us if it resulted in the increase in sales,” Tanner said of Conway’s Fox interview. “I think that’s one of the reasons the brand was largely in the news and could have attributed to this increase.” Conway did not respond to an email requesting comment. Her promotion of the fashion line appeared to violate an ethics rule barring federal employees from using their public office to endorse products and immediately drew criticism from both Democrats and Republicans. [Where does the Ivanka Trump brand go from here?] Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said Conway’s comments were “absolutely wrong, wrong, wrong” and “clearly over the line,” The Washington Post reported. The White House later said that Conway had been “counseled.” But concerns about her comments remain. On Thursday, the government’s top ethics official criticized the White House for not disciplining Conway, The Post’s Drew Harwell reported. Walter M. Shaub Jr., director of the Office of Government Ethics, had urged officials last month to reprimand the White House counsel but was rebuffed. On Thursday he wrote to Stefan C. Passantino, who handles White House ethics issues as the president’s deputy counsel. “When an employee’s conduct violates, disciplinary action serves to deter future misconduct,” Shaub wrote. “Not taking disciplinary action against a senior official under such circumstances risks undermining the ethics program.” [A Trump voter’s message to retailers: ‘Keep your mouths shut about our president’] Last month, a group of law professors filed a professional misconduct complaint against Conway — a",(The Washington Post’s Abha Bhattarai and Drew Harwell contributed to this report.)

The Paris climate agreement, which was signed by nearly 200 countries in 2015, aims to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. The agreement also encourages countries to increase their use of clean energy and to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.  The decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement has sparked widespread criticism and concern, with many arguing that it will have serious consequences for the planet and future generations.

A source told US magazine OK!: “When they got back together, Liam thought things would be different, but Miley hasn’t changed at all.  “She’s sobered up but she’s still immature and isn’t ready to commit to spending the rest of her life with one person.  “They do love each other but at this point it’s starting to become clear this relationship simply can’t go the distance.”  Miley and Liam are have tried couple’s therapy according to the magazine, but it hasn’t worked and only led to more fights. Liam is also said by friends to be envious of his brother, Chris, having three kids with his wife Elsa Pataky, but while he’s feeling more and more broody, Miley is not ready to commit to children and wants to focus on her career and having fun.","According to a reliable source, Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth are on the verge of ending their engagement for the second time. Despite their efforts to rekindle their relationship, including attending couple's therapy, it appears that their differences are insurmountable. 

Miley has reportedly not changed her ways, remaining immature and unprepared to commit to a lifelong partnership. Liam, on the other hand, is said to be feeling increasingly broody, envying his brother Chris Hemsworth's family life with three children. However, Miley is not ready to take the same path and would rather focus on her career and personal freedom. 

It seems that their love for each other is not enough to overcome their fundamental differences, and a breakup may be imminent. This news comes after Miley recently admitted that she doesn't envision getting married anytime soon, further indication that the couple's engagement may be coming to an end."

Photographs of the pair strolling out of a restaurant late Sunday night sparked speculation, but a rep for the “Avengers” actress tells us that there’s no romance happening.  “Simply put, they are friends as well as neighbors [in the Hamptons],” says ScarJo’s rep.  Flay, who in 2015 had a publicly contentious split from his wife of 10 years, Stephanie March, was last linked to “Masters of Sex” actress Heléne Yorke.  Johansson, who filed for divorce from French journalist Romain Dauriac in March, has been seeing “Saturday Night Live: Weekend Update” star Colin Jost since May, which was exclusively revealed by Page Six.  The cute couple was together on Sept. 30, when Johansson was spotted dropping Jost off at a star-studded “SNL” after-party at Tao Uptown that included guests like Beyoncé, Jay-Z, Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone and Dakota Johnson.  This article originally appeared in the New York Post.","A recent dinner engagement between actress Scarlett Johansson and Food Network personality Bobby Flay has sparked unwarranted speculation regarding the nature of their relationship.

gossipcop-2194660040,1,0,"First Lady Melania Trump claims there is a secret poisoner in the White House and fears her husband is being slowly poisoned with “heavy sedatives” smuggled into his drinks in an attempt to slow him down, control him, and discredit his presidency, according to reports.  While public debate rages about Donald Trump’s health, Melania has told friends and associates that the once robust and high energy man she knew and loved has been replaced with a “slower, damaged version”.  “By 8pm he is slurring,” she said. “This is not the man I know.”  Fearing that the sedatives are being pumped into the body of the POTUS via Coca-Cola that he orders by pressing a button he had installed on the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, Melania has insisted he stop drinking from the tap and instead revert to drinking from cans she brings herself.  “Donald’s heath improved out of sight when he stopped drinking from the tap,” Melania said.  However the First Lady fears the active campaign to poison the president is “a high level operation” and “not the work of a solitary loon.”  Melania is popular in the White House—as she is with the rest of the country—and she has befriended senior intelligence agency staff who remain loyal to president. They have educated her about Ronald Regan’s poisoning by the Deep State after his assassination attempt in 1981. They have also warned her that George W. Bush was reduced to a “brain damaged” state after years of steady poisoning.  But the advantage Trump may hold over his GOP predecessors in the Oval Office is that he has a wife who is wise to the ruse and is insisting he watch his food and drink intake closely for signs of adulteration.  Donald Trump’s food choices say a lot about the man. The president’s Howard Hughes-level pickiness when it comes to food is partly motivated by a desire to avoid being poisoned, according to Melania. He doesn’t trust those around him – and rightfully so.  As President Trump knows all too well, there are enemies of the state dug in deep at the White House.  Reporters from TIME recently got a glimpse behind-the-scenes at the White House, where they reported on what goes down at the president’s dinner table. Of particular interest was a meal enjoyed by the reporters, Trump, and Vice President Pence.  Pence’s meal was not unusual—he ate what everyone else did. But the POTUS received a meal fully customized to his own preferences, and closely observed by Melania who insisted on watching the chef prepare the meal with ingredients she provided herself.","“She knows that Trump’s life is in danger every time he eats or drinks anything,” a source close to the first family said. “She’s determined to protect him from those who seek to do him harm.”

First Lady Melania Trump has expressed concerns about the safety of her husband, President Donald Trump, citing the possibility of intentional poisoning through ""heavy sedatives"" added to his drinks. According to sources close to the First Lady, she fears that this is an attempt to slow down the President, control him, and ultimately discredit his presidency.  Melania has reportedly confided in friends and associates about her concerns, noting that the President's behavior has changed significantly, with him becoming increasingly lethargic and slurring his words by 8 pm. She believes that this is not the same man she once knew and loved.  The First Lady has taken matters into her own hands, insisting that the President stop drinking from the tap and instead consume only canned beverages that she brings herself. She believes that this has improved the President's health.  However, Melania suspects that the effort to poison the President is a well-orchestrated campaign, involving high-level operatives. She has reportedly befriended senior intelligence agency staff who remain loyal to the President and have informed her about previous instances of poisoning attempts on past presidents, such as Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush.  Despite these concerns, the First Lady remains vigilant in protecting her husband's health and safety. She has been closely monitoring his food and drink intake and has taken steps to ensure that his meals are prepared with ingredients she provides herself.  Recently, during a dinner with Vice President Pence and reporters from TIME, the First Lady was seen closely observing the chef as he prepared the President's meal, ensuring that it met her standards.  A source close to the First Lady has stated that she is determined to protect the President from those who seek to harm him. The President's food choices, which are often motivated by a desire to avoid poisoning, are a testament to the First Lady's efforts to keep him safe."

Born Kate Garry Hudson on April 19, 1979, in Los Angeles, California, US, she came to prominence in 2001 with her incredible turn in Almost Famous.

She got the chance to showcase her talent in 1996, when she made her TV debut on Fox's TV series Party of Five (1994-2000).

However, it was in 1999 that she started to attract public attention when critics lauded her brilliant portrayal of Cindy in ""200 Cigarettes"", even though the movie itself was a commercial disappointment. Onwards, her career experienced a significant advancement, especially after she managed to obtain a supporting role in ""Gossip"" and ""Dr T and the Women"" which both came up in 2000. While her accolade-worthy performance in Cameron Crowe's Almost Famous indicated that she was set to follow her mother in taking the film industry by storm. In the midst of a whirlwind schedule of fashion shoots and awards shows, she made an appearance in the romantic war drama The Four Feathers in 2002. Turning out to be a box-office failure, Hudson fired back with the surefire hit as she starred opposite quirky heartthrob Matthew McConaughey in the romantic comedy How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003). She continued to establish herself as a fully-fledged actress starring in subsequent productions like Raising Helen (2004), The Skeleton Key (2005), You, Me and Dupree (2006), Fool's Gold (2008) and Bride Wars (2009). As of most recent, she could be seen in the musical comedy-drama television series Glee as Cassandra July.","Her net worth is estimated to be around $38 million, which is an outcome of her hard work and dedication towards her craft.

Last week, Shelton caused an uproar when he sent a cryptic tweet about ""karma"" just as reports claimed that his ex-wife Miranda Lambert was dating a married man.  ""Been taking the high road for a long time.. I almost gave up. But I can finally see something on the horizon up there!! Wait!! Could it be?! Yep!! It’s karma!!"" Shelton tweeted after multiple outlets reported Lambert began dating married Turnpike Troubadours front man, Evan Felker.

Allen tweeted and deleted a post calling out Shelton for romancing Allen's then-girlfriend Lambert while Shelton was still married to his first wife, Kaynette Williams, in 2006.

""I kept my mouth shut for 13 years. Sorry, his karma tweet rubbed me wrong. All of this is pointless,"" he added.  Allen told RadarOnline.com, ""I’m sure Miranda did [Blake] dirty just like she did me, but he wasn’t thinking about me when he was cheating with her, so I don’t know why he thinks it's karma.""

Blake Shelton, a well-known country singer, has recently caused a stir with a tweet about karma, which many believe was directed at his ex-wife Miranda Lambert's new relationship with a married man. However, Lambert's ex-boyfriend Jeff Allen has come forward, claiming that Shelton is not as innocent as he seems. Allen alleges that Shelton had an affair with Lambert while he was still married to his first wife, Kaynette Williams, in 2006.  Lambert and Shelton's romance has been reported to have begun as an affair, although both singers have denied this in the past. They became engaged in May 2010 and married a year later in Texas. The country singers announced their divorce after four years of marriage in July 2015.  Lambert has recently been linked to Turnpike Troubadours front man, Evan Felker, who is also married. Felker's wife, Staci Nelson, filed for divorce on February 16, and it is unclear whether Lambert and Felker are still together.  Shelton's tweet, which read, ""Been taking the high road for a long time.. I almost gave up. But I can finally see something on the horizon up there!! Wait!! Could it be?! Yep!! It’s karma!!"" has sparked controversy, with many interpreting it as a dig at Lambert's new relationship.  Allen took to Twitter to call out Shelton, stating, ""You know, I’ve always given you the benefit of the doubt and chalked it up to just being human, but you must be one arrogant SOB to pop off something like this, when I know damn good and well you were cheating on your wife and Miranda was cheating on me when you two started up.""  Allen continued, ""I kept my mouth shut for 13 years. Sorry, his karma tweet rubbed me wrong. All of this is pointless.""  A rep for Shelton did not return Fox News' request for comment.  It is worth noting that Lambert and Shelton have both denied that their romance began as an affair. Lambert has not publicly commented on her relationship with Felker, and Shelton has not addressed the controversy surrounding his tweet.

gossipcop-7885025406,1,0,"More than a month has passed since Matt Lauer was fired from the Today show, and his former longtime colleague, Katie Couric, is now opening up about the former NBC anchor’s shocking dismissal.  “The whole thing has been very painful for me,” Couric, 61, tells PEOPLE. “The accounts I’ve read and heard have been disturbing, distressing and disorienting and it’s completely unacceptable that any woman at the Today show experienced this kind of treatment.  “I had no idea this was going on during my tenure or after I left,” she continued. “I think I speak for many of my former colleagues when I say this was not the Matt we knew. Matt was a kind and generous colleague who treated me with respect. In fact, a joke I once made on late-night television was just that, because it was completely contrary to our brother-sister relationship. It’s still very upsetting. I really admire the way Savannah [Guthrie] and Hoda [Kotb] and the entire Today show staff have handled a very difficult situation.”  The late-night show joke that Couric refers to is when she said on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen in 2012 that Lauer “pinches me on the ass a lot.” A clip of the comment made the rounds online in the wake of Lauer’s firing.  Couric spent 15 years co-hosting NBC’s Today show with Lauer, 60, but left in May 2006 to anchor the CBS Evening News.  NBC/Getty  Lauer was fired at the end of November by NBC News after the network received a “detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior,” with reason to believe “this may not have been an isolated incident.” Women have also anonymously accused him of sexual harassment and assault in reports published by Variety and The New York Times.  Following his firing, which was announced live on Today by Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb, Lauer addressed the original allegations in a statement.  “There are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions,” he said, in part. “To the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry. As I am writing this, I realize the depth of the damage and disappointment I have left behind at home and at NBC.”  Although her PEOPLE interview is the first time Couric has spoken in detail about Lauer’s exit, she briefly broke her silence about the scandal on social media in December.  In a short response to an Instagram user, who called Couric out for not publicly addressing the scandal, the veteran journalist said, “It’s incredibly upsetting and I will say something when I’m ready to. Thanks for your interest.”  RELATED VIDEO: Women of Hollywood Attend Golden Globes Together in Support of the Time’s Up Movement  The claims against Lauer came as hundreds of women and men — including Rose McGowan, Ashley Judd, Terry Crews and Anthony Rapp — have publicly came forward about alleged sexual misconduct at the hands of powerful men in Hollywood, including Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey.  The movement inspired the new Time’s Up initiative and legal defense fund that was created to help victims of sexual misconduct pursue legal action against their perpetrators. Time’s Up was a major focus at this year’s Golden Globes, where almost all the famous attendees wore black to raise awareness about the cause.  “I think it was really moving to see so many women support each other and demand change, not only for themselves, but for mistreated and marginalized women in all kinds of industries,” Couric tells PEOPLE about Time’s Up. “Clearly we are witnessing a sea change and a long overdue course correction.”  She also said that one of the new of the episodes of her upcoming six-part documentary Nat Geo series will focus on harassment women have experienced in their workplaces.  “One of my Nat Geo episodes explores the various obstacles that are holding women back in Hollywood, Silicon Valley and beyond,” she says. “I just interviewed Elisabeth Moss about this.

gossipcop-500443225,1,0,"Three years after announcing their separation and more than a year after filing for divorce, Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner are still legally married — and they may be that way for a while if they don’t act fast.  LA County Superior Court advised the couple that their divorce case may be delayed because they have yet to file and enter the final judgment, a document obtained by The Blast revealed.  “If you fail to take the appropriate steps in your case, the court may dismiss your case for delay in prosecution,” the document states.  It’s unclear what the holdup is.  Garner, 46, and Affleck, 45, were married for nearly 10 years before separating in 2015. Last year, following reports that Garner had called off their divorce, Affleck finally moved out of the property the couple shared.  Shortly after, it was revealed that Affleck had moved on with “Saturday Night Live” producer Lindsay Shookus in July 2017.  The exes have an amicable relationship and are focused on co-parenting their daughters, Violet, 12, and Seraphina, 9, and son Samuel, 6.  “We are definitely a modern family. We’re doing really well,” Garner said previously. “It has to be [children first]. You have no choice. It has to be.”  Reps for Garner and Affleck did not immediately return requests for comment.

In light of recent news, it appears that the divorce proceedings between Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner have stalled. Despite filing for divorce over a year ago, the couple remains legally married, and it seems that their case may be delayed due to inaction on their part.

According to documents obtained by The Blast, the LA County Superior Court has informed the couple that their failure to take appropriate steps in their case may result in dismissal due to delay in prosecution. It is unclear what is causing the holdup in the proceedings.

Garner, 46, and Affleck, 45, were married for nearly a decade before announcing their separation in 2015. Following their separation, the couple continued to reside in the same property until Affleck finally moved out last year. It was later revealed that Affleck had moved on with ""Saturday Night Live"" producer Lindsay Shookus in July 2017.

Despite their differences, the exes have maintained an amicable relationship and have prioritized co-parenting their three children, Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel, 6. In a previous statement, Garner emphasized the importance of putting their children first, stating, ""It has to be [children first]. You have no choice. It has to be.""

Representatives for Garner and Affleck did not immediately return requests for comment.

As the world watches the developments in their divorce case, it is clear that the modern family dynamic is becoming increasingly common. The focus on co-parenting and prioritizing the needs of children in the face of divorce is a positive trend that is likely to continue in the future.

In conclusion, while the divorce proceedings between Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner may be delayed, it is heartening to see the couple prioritizing their children's needs and maintaining a civil relationship for the sake of their family."

But the male player ranked 701 in the world - Dmitry Tursunov - believes he could beat her.  Speaking to US radio station NPR, seven-time Grand Slam champion McEnroe said of former world number one Williams, who has won an Open-era record 23 Grand Slams: ""If she played the men's circuit she'd be, like, 700 in the world.""  He qualified the comments by saying: ""That doesn't mean I don't think Serena is an incredible player, and I suppose anything's possible; maybe at some point a women's tennis player can be better than anybody.""  But he added: ""I just haven't seen that in any other sport, and I haven't seen it in tennis. If she had to just play the men's circuit, it would be an entirely different story.""  Williams later responded on Twitter: ""Dear John, I adore and respect you but please please keep me out of your statements that are not factually based.  ""I've never played anyone ranked ""there"" nor do I have time. Respect me and my privacy as I'm trying to have a baby. Good day sir.""  Williams, 35, won her 23rd Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in January. It later transpired she was pregnant at the time  'She is pregnant, and I'm not'  Tursunov, 34, was once ranked as high as 20th in the world.  The Russian told BBC World Service Sport he did not think McEnroe was ""trying to talk women's tennis down"" but said ""the reality"" was that ""men are stronger in general"".  ""I would hope that I would win against Serena,"" he added.  ""It would be a similar argument to: who would run faster, the fastest woman or the fastest man? Tennis is becoming more and more a physical sport, so it's going to be hard for a woman to beat the men.  ""It's not black and white, there are lots of factors to take into account. Physically I might not be in the best shape of my life but as an overall package I'm much better than my ranking would suggest. She is pregnant, and I'm not.  ""I've never heard John say anything absolutely stupid - he knows his stuff. What he said about her being an incredible player is correct - explosive, powerful and she puts in a lot of work. But I would hope that I would win.""  Battle of the sexes  A crowd of 30,000 watched Billie Jean King take on Bobby Riggs in Houston in 1973  Tennis matches between men and women have occurred before, mostly notably back in 1973 when Billie Jean King took on fellow American Bobby Riggs.  Riggs, the world number one in the 1940s, retired in 1951 and at the age of 55 believed he could beat any of the top female players.  King originally declined to play Riggs and Australian Margaret Court - at the time the top female player in the world - stepped in. Riggs won 6-2 6-1.  But later that year, the top ranked women's player King - 26 years younger than Riggs at 29 - took him on in an exhibition match at the Houston Astrodome and won 6-4 6-3 6-3.  A third 'Battle of the Sexes' match took in 1992 between American former world number one Jimmy Connors, aged 40 at the time, and Czech and American Martina Navratilova, who was 35.  The match took place under special rules to make it more competitive - Connors was allowed only one serve per point, and Navratilova was allowed to hit into half the doubles court. Connors won 7-5 6-2.","And in 1998, Martina Hingis, then 17, played a set against the 43-year-old Connors at the US Open. Hingis won 6-2.

Rewritten passage:
Serena Williams, a seven-time Grand Slam champion and former world number one, has sparked a debate about gender equality in tennis after John McEnroe, a former men's world number one, claimed that she would struggle to be in the world's top 700 if she played on the men's circuit. In an interview with US radio station NPR, McEnroe stated that while he acknowledges Williams' exceptional talent, he believes her ranking would be much lower in the men's circuit due to the physical differences between men and women.

Williams responded to McEnroe's comments on Twitter, expressing her disappointment and requesting respect for her privacy as she is trying to have a baby. Dmitry Tursunov, a former world number 20 player, also weighed in on the debate, stating that while he believes Williams is an incredible player, he would hope to beat her in a match due to the physical advantages men generally possess.

This debate is not the first time that gender equality in tennis has been brought to the forefront. In 1973, Billie Jean King took on Bobby Riggs in an exhibition match, known as the ""Battle of the Sexes,"" and won 6-4 6-3 6-3. The match was a significant moment in the history of women's tennis and helped to promote gender equality in the sport.

The debate surrounding Williams and McEnroe's comments highlights the ongoing discussion about gender equality in tennis and raises questions about the physical differences between men and women and how they impact performance in the sport. While some argue that men are generally stronger and faster than women, others point out that women have made significant strides in the sport and deserve equal respect and recognition. Ultimately, the debate serves as a reminder of the importance of promoting gender equality in all areas of life, including sports."

On Monday, January 7, 2013, twin sisters Rebeika Powell and Kayetie Powell-Melchor, 23; Misty Nunley, 33, and Julie Jackson, 55 were found shot in the head, with their hands tied behind their backs inside a south Tulsa apartment, police say. A 3-year-old boy was also found inside the apartment, unharmed.  Chief Jordan said the murders were not gang-related. According to arrest reports, witnesses told investigators that the brothers left an apartment in the same building at Fairmont Terrace Apartments, near 61st and Peoria, saying they were going to pull a ""lick"" at the victims' apartment.  Witnesses told police the brothers returned about 20 minutes later with a bag full of drugs, cash, and jewelry. According to the report, James Poore told the witnesses that he shot one of the victims because she could identify him and that Cedric shot the other three. The witnesses told investigators the brothers split the money and that Cedric Poore took the jewelry to pawn.    When he was interviewed Wednesday, James Poore confirmed to investigators that he knew one of the victims and that he was in the apartment where the witnesses placed him. Before invoking his right to remain silent, he told investigators he knew one of the victims had used and sold illegal drugs and that Cedric drove a black van to the apartment the day of the murders.    The arrest report shows Cedric Poore denied being in the apartment the day of the murders and refused to speak to investigators any more.  Chief Jordan said the brothers both stayed at Fairmont Terrace Apartments. The property manager there told News On 6 that neither of them are on a lease.  Cedric Poore has been in Tulsa County jail on a traffic violation since January 14, and James Poore was arrested Wednesday morning. Department of Corrections records show both James and Cedric have been previously convicted and incarcerated for robbery with a firearm.  Chief Jordan said more arrests may still be made.  Mayor Dewey Bartlett released a statement Wednesday afternoon, in response to the news of the arrests:    ""The Tulsa Police Department is known for their quick efforts of finding perpetrators and they indeed lived up to their stellar reputation for this case. I have the utmost confidence in Chief Chuck Jordan and the Tulsa Police Department and I knew they would bring in those involved with this hideous quadruple murder in very short order. Although a direct tip from the public cannot be identified as the catalyst that led to the arrests, tips are always important, which is part of great police work from our force.""","Tulsa Police Department Public Information Officer, Jeanne MacKenzie, said the investigation is still ongoing and more charges could be filed.  ""We have been working around the clock to find the individuals responsible for these senseless murders and to bring justice to the victims and their families,"" MacKenzie said. ""While these arrests are a significant step forward, we still have a lot of work ahead of us to ensure that justice is served.""  MacKenzie also expressed gratitude to the community for their help in the investigation. ""We couldn't have done it without the help of the public,"" she said. ""We received numerous tips and pieces of information that helped us identify and track down the suspects. We are grateful for the community's support and cooperation."""

If you look past all the staring into iPhone screens, those daily delivered box salads and the 'like, seriously' slang, there's some genuinely stirring stuff in there.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  What about Kim relaying the story of her terrifying ordeal in Paris? Khloe's fertility concerns? Scott and Courtney's frighteningly dysfunctional relationship?  Well, if you've shed the odd tear for the Ks over the years, you aren't alone.  In the family's celebratory Hollywood Reporter cover story, Kendall explained to the magazine that members of the crew can't help sobbing when one of the girls opens up.  Hollywood reporter A post shared by Kendall (@kendalljenner) on Aug 16, 2017 at 8:26am PDT  She said, 'We have such a personal relationship with the crew. When one of us cries on the show usually you'll look around and the camera guy is crying and the producer is crying'  Kim added, 'It really is an intimate relationship.

THE KARDASHIAN DECADE A post shared by Kourtney Kardashian (@kourtneykardash) on Aug 16, 2017 at 6:39am PDT  Whoever was on set would have also been privy to Kendall's reaction to the politically insensitive Pepsi advert she was must-lambasted for. Though we as a public have received no evidence of how Kendall reacted to the onslaught of criticism (she has deleted all evidence of it on her social media and has never made a statement), Kim explains that Kendall would never let herself be shown on camera crying.  She told the magazine:  We're not perfect, but you see these things in the media, like Kendall and Pepsi, where I see her at home crying, but in the media she looks another way because she's not addressing it. I'm just like, 'This is wrong. You need to speak up.' She was like, 'I don't ever want to show that footage of me crying.' She was trying to not make excuses or be dramatic, but that was what she was going through at the time.  We suppose the only non-family members who know the truth are those blubbering crew members then.","Here is a rewritten version of the passage in a more serious, calm, and informative tone:

For 10 years, Keeping Up With The Kardashians has captivated audiences with its emotional storylines, which often revolve around the family's personal struggles and triumphs. Despite the show's reputation for superficiality, a closer look reveals a depth of emotion that may surprise viewers. The Kardashian sisters have faced a range of challenges, from Kim's terrifying ordeal in Paris to Khloe's fertility concerns and Scott and Courtney's troubled relationship. These moments have moved crew members to tears, as Kendall Jenner revealed in a Hollywood Reporter cover story. She said, ""We have such a personal relationship with the crew. When one of us cries on the show, usually you'll look around and the camera guy is crying and the producer is crying."" Kim Kardashian added, ""It really is an intimate relationship. These people see every last thing."" The crew, which can range from one person to a 30-strong team, has witnessed the family's most vulnerable moments. Even Kendall's reaction to the backlash over her controversial Pepsi advert was captured on camera, though she has chosen not to address it publicly. Kim explained, ""We're not perfect, but you see these things in the media, like Kendall and Pepsi, where I see her at home crying, but in the media, she looks another way because she's not addressing it. I'm just like, 'This is wrong. You need to speak up.' She was like, 'I don't ever want to show that footage of me crying.'

gossipcop-8106461875,1,0,"Absurdly Driven looks at the world of business with a skeptical eye and a firmly rooted tongue in cheek.  People are always saying unflattering things about you.  Even if you're the Pope.  The only time it can affect you, however, is when you hear about it.  Or, worse, if someone makes the unpleasant comment directly to you.  Which brings us, quite naturally, to Twitter.  Here's a place that's just too perfect for the nasty, uncontrolled insult.  You can hide behind your egg and toss Bons-Molotovs at anyone you choose.  Some people choose Kim Kardashian.  She's an easy target.  Her life seems effortless. She's painfully wealthy, with a TV show, branded products left and right and an appearance fee surely only rivaled by Hillary Clinton.  Hers is such a cushy life that she can listen to Kanye West any time she wants.  Small wonder, then, that a Twitter user called Kevin James offered a wry dig at her countenance.  Is it me, or is @KimKardashian Sooo Self-absorbed.. even when she's saying Nothing.. lol.. & I Like the Kardashians #KUWTK -- Kevin James (@kevinjames4good) January 22, 2018  If you've ever been attacked on Twitter, you have choices.  You can reply aggressively. This is rarely worth it with a troll.  You can ignore it and even block the person who directed their bile your way.  You can wait for your own fans to descend upon this poor individual and shred him from tweet to tweet.  Or, you can be splendidly disarming.  This last path was the one taken by Kardashian.  No it's not you, I totally am! https://t.co/9ZxgPyVkko -- Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) January 22, 2018  Not everyone can pull this off with a straight face.  But here, Kardashian showed she understood the emotional essence of her interlocutor.  His biggest problem was surely that he isn't Kim Kardashian.  So she brought him onto her side with something so blessedly charming that it not only made her seem entirely self-aware -- rather than merely self-absorbed -- but also must have enticed a chuckle from Kevin James himself.  Indeed, it incited James to respond with quite considered contrition.  @KimKardashian Listen: altho my tweet came across ""seemingly"" disrespectful, it was just a thought/tweet worthy reaction.. lol... No DisRespect.. .. & I Appreciate ur Sense of humor, & @cassbrunelle14 for calling me out.. lol.. props to the Kardashian Empire -- Kevin James (@kevinjames4good) January 22, 2018  And so, without a word of insult, without so much as a miffed gesture, Kardashian took a situation that could have been emotionally straining and turned it into one the most pleasant feelings we have: laughter.  We'd all love to have that skill.  On truly good days, we find it.  On most other days, we walk away from a tense situation and only then do we start kicking ourselves that we didn't react a different way.  Harnessing it surely takes practice. A lot of practice.  Something Kardashian has surely done.","And, in this case, she got a bonus.  James, whoever he is, has a certain charm of his own.  He can write a good tweet.  He also has a good sense of humor.  He recognized that his tweet was not exactly necessary.  And he apologized.  One day, perhaps he will meet Kardashian.  He might find he has a lot in common with her.  After all, they share a certain something: a sense of humor."

The country superstar opened up about his romance with the No Doubt frontwoman in a new interview with Billboard magazine.  As previously reported, Shelton told Stefani that he was splitting from Lambert during a meeting with their Voice coworkers. The “Misery” singer, who was new to the team at the time, got emotional.  “I won’t forget that day. I looked over at Gwen — who I didn’t really know — and she had these huge tears in her eyes. I thought, ‘Wow, she feels super bad for me!’” Shelton recalled. “She didn’t tell me much, because we didn’t know each other at the time, but she said, ‘I’m going through something very similar to what you’re going through. I understand. And I hate it.’”  Stefani was dealing with her own breakup at the time with Gavin Rossdale. (As Us Weekly exclusively revealed, the Bush rocker was cheating on her with their children’s nanny, Mindy Mann.) They announced they were ending their 13-year marriage in August 2015, one month after Shelton and Lambert announced they were divorcing after four years.  The “Came Here to Forget” singer and Stefani leaned on each other for support during the difficult time. The closer they got, the more Shelton saw Stefani in a new light.  “That’s kind of how our friendship and bond started, that day. It went from that, to checking in on each other once a week through email — ‘This s–t happened to me, what happened to you?’ — to maybe three times a week, then every day, to ‘Hey, here’s my phone number if you ever want to text,’” Shelton told Billboard. “Next thing I know, I wake up and she’s all I care about, and I’m ­wondering if she feels the same about me.”  “Gwen saved my life,” he added. “Who else on earth could understand going through a high-profile divorce from another musician? You can’t even imagine the similarities in our divorces.”  The two teamed up professionally too. Shelton included their collaborative track, “Go Ahead and Break My Heart,” on his 12th studio album, If I’m Honest.  “When we recorded the vocals for some of these songs, I was only six months removed from when all the crap went down,” Shelton said of his split from Lambert. “When you have a broken heart — at least, when I do — you got to get it out of your system. You want people to sympathize with you.

In addition to her net worth, she has a highly coveted position in the world of magazine publishing. She has also served as the (albeit not very flattering) inspiration for the popular novel and movie The Devil Wears Prada. Her career began in the world of fashion before moving into journalism, largely at the behest of her parents. In the year 1970, Wintour was hired on as an editorial assistant for the new Harper's & Queen fashion magazine. Even at this early stage of her career, Wintour divulged to coworkers that she had the desire to edit Vogue, a desire that would grow to be fulfilled nearly 20 years later. Wintour introduced sweeping changes to Vogue from her first issue forward. Many of these changes could be seen right on the cover. Wintour favored more naturalistic photography of lesser-known models outside, as opposed to the tight headshots the magazine had previously favored. Additionally, Wintour's first Vogue cover was also the first to feature a model wearing jeans, with the added bonus of wearing a bejeweled T-shirt valued at around $10,000. Under Wintour, Vogue has continued to be one of the pillars of fashion journalism.","Please reword the 'passage' to make it more convincing.

Anna Wintour, the current editor-in-chief of Vogue magazine, boasts an impressive net worth of $35 million, a testament to her influential position in the world of fashion and publishing. Her career trajectory has been nothing short of remarkable, with her beginnings in fashion eventually leading her to journalism, at the urging of her parents. In 1970, Wintour joined the team at Harper's & Queen as an editorial assistant, already harboring a burning ambition to one day edit Vogue. This aspiration would materialize nearly two decades later.

Upon taking the reins at Vogue, Wintour introduced a series of revolutionary changes, immediately noticeable on the magazine's covers. She favored more natural, effortless photography featuring lesser-known models, a departure from the tight headshots that had previously been the norm. Additionally, her first Vogue cover featured a model donning jeans, paired with a bejeweled T-shirt valued at an astounding $10,000.

Under Wintour's stewardship, Vogue has continued to be a leading force in fashion journalism, cementing its place as a go-to source for industry insights, cutting-edge trends, and high-end fashion.

It’s been more than two years since Blake Shelton, 40, and Miranda Lambert, 33, ended their marriage, but she’s finally ready to sit down and hash things out, according to a new report. Amidst new rumors that Blake is having trouble in his relationship with Gwen Stefani, 47, an insider tells InTouch that Miranda wants to confront her ex to finally get closure. “It needs to be done,” the source tells the mag. “There’s still a lot of unfinished business between [Miranda] and Blake. She needs to look straight into Blake’s eyes, ask certain questions, and get answers.”  There are no plans set for this meeting to actually take place just yet, but the mag claims that if it does happen, Miranda plans to go in with a “clear head,” although that might not be so easy. “This could get heated,” the insider admits. “As soon as the emotions come up, [Miranda] may lose it.” This doesn’t mean the 33-year-old wants to get back together with her ex, though — actually, it’s just the opposite. She’s very happy with her man, Anderson East, 29, but feels a face-to-face with Blake is what she needs to fully be ready to commit to another relationship, according to the source.  “She feels that [she and Blake] have both grown so much since their divorce that meeting up is essential for them to have healthy relationships in the future,” InTouch’s insider says. “Who knows, maybe this meeting with Blake will have them walk away as friends. Either way, they’ll definitely be in a better place.”  As for the rumored trouble between Blake and Gwen, we’re going to take that report (from OK! magazine) with a grain of salt.

Jennifer Lopez is not in a hurry to walk down the aisle with Alex Rodriguez, but she does want to spend the rest of her life with someone.  “I do believe in marriage,” the Shades of Blue actress, 48, told Harper’s Bazaar in a story published on Thursday, March 15. “And I would love to grow old with somebody in a committed relationship. But I’m not forcing anything right now.”  As far as her relationship with the 42-year-old former Yankees player, she said: “It’s good, it’s healthy; we communicate well. We understand each other’s lives in a way that most other people couldn’t.”  She added: “We both entered the public eye in our early twenties and overachieved right from the start. And that affects every dynamic in your life, from your family to your work to your relationships. We have a similar makeup.”  The pair celebrated their anniversary in February in Minneapolis, where the singer performed a concert ahead of the Super Bowl. During the show, she debuted her single “Us” written by Poo Bear and produced by Skrillex, and dedicated it to Rodriguez, who was in the audience. “We’ve been together for one year today. I don’t want to get all mushy or anything, but baby, this song’s for you. I love you,” she told the athlete while on stage.  When talking about how she chose the song, Lopez told the magazine that the lyrics fit right into where the couple were in their relationship. She said: “They played me about 20 different songs, and when I heard this one I was like, ‘Oh, this is relevant!’ Alex and I were just getting to know each other. And I was like, ‘Oh, my God, could this be? Could this be us?’”  Lopez was previously married to chef Ojani Noa for nearly a year in 1997, and dancer Cris Judd from 2001 to 2002. She later married singer Marc Anthony in 2004 and they called it quits in 2011. The pair share 10-year-old twins Max and Emme. The former Yankees shortstop shares daughters Ella, 9, and Natasha, 13, with ex-wife Cynthia Scurtis. They split in 2008 after six years of marriage.  A lot has changed in the “Dance Again” songstress’ life since her last relationship, and she said a lot of it has to do with really knowing herself. “When I was younger I spent a lot of time being half happy and half not happy,” she told the publication. “I know who I am and what I want. I also know my strengths and weaknesses. It took me a long time to get to a point where I could say something nice about myself. I’m glad I can do that now.”  Lopez remains optimistic as she continues with her career, raise her two children and make her relationship with Rodriguez work for the long run. “Baseball is just like life,” she said. “All you want to do is hit a home run.”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!",———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

gossipcop-5658990975,1,0,"Daniel Craig is returning as James Bond once again, even as he reportedly fights to save his marriage to Rachel Weisz at the same time. Craig has already announced his intent to return as 007 in the franchise’s 25th film, and according to the National Enquirer, he’s still struggling to salvage what’s left of his marriage.  The Enquirer’s source claimed at the beginning of 2017, “Rachel and Daniel haven’t been happy for a while, and nearly called it quits last year.” The report claims that the married couple was in two separate filming locations at the beginning of the year, but continued to stay apart even after wrapping their respective films. The Enquirer then claims that they finally reunited in July after not being seen together in ‘554 days’.  According to the sources, the minute the outlet attempted to lock down an exclusive on the couple’s rocky marriage, both Rachel Weisz and Daniel Craig were seen arriving at New York’s Public Theater the next day, prompting the source to add, “The whole thing just seemed like too much of a coincidence. I don’t buy it for a minute.”  When you consider Daniel Craig’s own words, especially in the context of allegedly turning down a $150 million payday to star in two more James Bond films, he had stated, “Being on your own would be sad, sick, and weird. I don’t trust myself. I need that balance.” If these reports are to be believed, then Daniel Craig previously turned down starring in more Bond films to spend time with his family, but now – all of a sudden – he’s back to working on James Bond?  Either the report was never accurate to begin with, or he’s giving up on his marriage to Rachel Weisz. One would hope that the two have worked out whatever was troubling them in the first place, but given their own relationship and marriage histories – and how they’ve both jumped ship on long-term relationships at the drop of a hat – one wouldn’t be faulted for assuming that they are on their way to getting a divorce.  What do you guys think? Are Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz having marriage troubles, and is Daniel’s decision to take on the role of 007 again an indication that he’s giving up on his marriage? Or just a chance to have more career stability and/or cash in on a major paycheck? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.  Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images for Sony Pictures",". According to reports, Daniel Craig is set to reprise his role as James Bond for the 25th installment of the franchise. However, rumors have been circulating that his marriage to Rachel Weisz may be in trouble. An unnamed source told the National Enquirer that the couple had been struggling in their relationship and had even considered splitting up last year. The source also claimed that the two were apart for extended periods of time while filming separate projects, and only recently reunited after not being seen together for 554 days.  Despite the speculation, it's important to note that neither Craig nor Weisz has publicly confirmed any issues in their marriage. In fact, Craig has previously spoken about the importance of maintaining a balance between his career and personal life. He has stated that he needs the stability of a relationship to counteract the demands of his profession.  It's possible that Craig's decision to return to the Bond franchise may be an indication that he is prioritizing his career over his marriage. However, it's also possible that the couple has worked through any issues they may have had and that Craig's return to Bond is simply a matter of career stability and financial gain. Ultimately, without further information, it's impossible to say for certain what is happening in the couple's personal lives.  It's worth noting that both Craig and Weisz have a history of ending long-term relationships. Craig was previously married to Fiona Loudon for four years before divorcing in 1991, and Weisz was married to Darren Aronofsky for nine years before separating in 2010.  The public's fascination with celebrity relationships often leads to speculation and rumors, and it's important to remember that these individuals deserve privacy and respect. While it's natural to be curious about the personal lives of famous actors like Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz, it's important to avoid jumping to conclusions or spreading unsubstantiated rumors.  In conclusion, while there may be speculation about the state of Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz's marriage, there is currently no concrete evidence to support any claims of trouble in their relationship. It's possible that Craig's return to the Bond franchise may be a sign of prioritizing his career, but it's also possible that the couple has worked through any issues and that Craig's return is simply a matter of career stability and financial gain. Ultimately, only time will tell what is happening in their personal lives."

So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired. T","ellingly, neither Foxx nor Holmes denied the authenticity of the photos.

Here's a rewritten version of the passage in a more serious, calm, and informative tone:

Katie Holmes, the former ""Dawson's Creek"" actress, has been the subject of several reports regarding her relationships with her boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise, and daughter Suri. According to RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were planning a lavish $300,000 wedding, with 12-year-old Suri serving as her bridesmaid. However, the wedding was reportedly called off after Holmes realized that Foxx, 50, was not ready to give up his bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter. Foxx allegedly took Grannis, not Holmes, to Leonardo DiCaprio's birthday party in November.

A source told RadarOnline that Holmes noticed a lack of respect in Foxx's behavior and realized that being unfaithful could be costly. Holmes has been a single mom and is determined to protect her daughter and herself. Meanwhile, Tom Cruise, Holmes' ex-husband, has been trying to reconnect with their daughter Suri, whom he has not seen in over five years due to his Church of Scientology beliefs. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise regrets missing out on his daughter's life and wants to be a part of it. However, Holmes is hesitant about a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology in exchange for him staying away from their daughter.

Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion. Notably, Leslie Sloane, Holmes' publicist, denied the Radar story, marking the first official acknowledgment from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship exists. Holmes and Foxx have kept their relationship a secret, reportedly due to a divorce settlement from Cruise that prohibited Holmes from publicly dating for five years after their breakup. The secrecy surrounding their relationship has led to speculation about its existence, but neither Foxx nor Holmes has denied the authenticity of photos of them together.

In summary, Katie Holmes' personal life has been the subject of much speculation, with reports of a cancelled wedding, a potential reunion with her ex-husband, and a secret relationship with Jamie Foxx. While representatives for Holmes have denied some of these reports, the fact remains that Holmes and Foxx have been keeping their relationship under wraps for quite some time."

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email  Meghan Markle’s childhood best friend has revealed the real reason her first marriage broke up - and it wasn't a mutual decision.  Childhood pal Ninaki Priddy opened up about Prince Harry's fiancée, claiming her desire to be famous outweighed her commitment to her marriage to film producer Trevor Engelson.  Meghan married her ex back in 2011 on a Jamaican beach. They split two years later after she landed her role in Suits, which filmed in Toronto. Previously it was thought the pair grew apart after Meghan spent months filming in Canada and her beau was based in LA.  Ninaki says otherwise.  (Image: Getty Images North America)  (Image: REX/Shutterstock)  ""The way she handled it, Trevor definitely had the rug pulled out from under him. He was hurt,"" she said, explaining that while Trevor was heartbroken, Meghan was less affected,"" she told Mail Online.  Prior to their split, Ninaki - who was maid of honour at the wedding - said the pair doted on each other and Trevor would have done anything for the actress.  ""Then, after the wedding, it was like a light switched off. There’s Meghan before fame and Meghan after fame. After three seasons of Suits, she called me to say the marriage was over.  The pair first met aged two at Hollywood’s private Little Red School House before they went to the Immaculate Heart girls’ high school in Los Angeles at the age of 11.  Following a close friendship that she describes as 'sisterly', Ninaki says the pair eventually fell out over how Meghan and ex-husband - who the ex Suits star met when she was just 23 - split.  She explains she went to visit Trevor who was heartbroken over their split, while Meghan seemed less affected.  (Image: Instagram)  Elsewhere, Ninaki said her former best friend, who quit Suits to pursue a life with Harry, always wanted to be famous.

""We used to imagine her receiving an Oscar. She used to practise announcing herself.""  While talking about her relationship with Harry and her role as a future royal, Ninaki claims Meghan was always very aware of the Royal Family - despite the actress claiming she knew little about Harry when they met.  ""I think it’s a very fanciful dream to believe that you just walk into a Prince Charming.  ""I know the Royal Family was something she found fascinating. She had one of Princess Diana’s books [Diana: Her True Story] on her bookshelf, and even when she was with Trevor she told me she wanted to go and stay in London for at least a month.""  She added: ""I wasn’t shocked or even surprised to hear about Prince Harry. I know she used to love The Princess Diaries — films about a commoner who becomes part of a Royal Family. She was very taken with that idea.""","Meghan Markle's estranged half-sister Samantha Markle has also spoken about the couple's split, claiming that Meghan was the one who ended it.  She tweeted: ""Meg ended her marriage with Trevor over 'lack of commitment' or some such nonsense... now she's crying foul? Please.""  (Image: Getty Images North America)  It's not the first time Ninaki has spoken out about her former friend's split.  In 2016, she told The Sun that Meghan was the one who ended the marriage, saying: ""Meghan was the one who ended it. She said she wanted out and Trevor was left reeling.""  (Image: Instagram)  In an interview with the Daily Mail in 2017, Ninaki added: ""I think Meghan was very unhappy in her marriage. She didn't have much work, she wasn't earning a lot of money and she was living in this tiny apartment with two dogs. She wanted out.""  (Image: Getty Images North America)  It's claimed that Meghan and Trevor had a 'whirlwind romance' before they tied the knot in Jamaica, with Meghan reportedly saying she knew she wanted to marry him after just five months of dating.  (Image: Instagram)  However, their relationship was said to have crumbled when Meghan landed the role of Rachel Zane in Suits, which filmed in Toronto.  (Image: Getty Images North America)  It was previously thought that Meghan and Trevor grew apart after she spent months filming in Canada and he was based in LA.  But Ninaki's words suggest there was more to the story.  (Image: Instagram)  It's believed that Meghan and Prince Harry will wed on May 19 at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.

In recent years, the world has seen a surge in the popularity of video games. This is hardly surprising, given the level of entertainment and engagement that they offer. From action-packed adventures to strategic puzzles, video games have something for everyone. They provide a unique way to experience different worlds, meet new people, and challenge ourselves in ways that we never thought possible.

However, there is also a darker side to video games. Addiction, social isolation, and aggression are just a few of the negative effects that have been linked to excessive video game use. As a society, we need to be aware of these risks and take steps to mitigate them. This includes setting limits on the amount of time spent playing video games, encouraging healthy gaming habits, and providing support for those who may be struggling with addiction.

Despite these concerns, the popularity of video games shows no signs of slowing down. New technologies and innovations are constantly being developed, offering even more immersive and engaging experiences. The future of video games looks bright, and it will be interesting to see how they continue to evolve and shape our lives in the years to come.

According to a study by the Entertainment Software Association, the average amount of time spent playing video games per week is around six hours. This may not seem like a lot, but it can quickly add up over time. It is important to be mindful of how much time we are spending in front of a screen and to make sure that we are not neglecting other important aspects of our lives.

In conclusion, video games offer a unique form of entertainment that can be both enjoyable and engaging. However, it is important to be aware of the potential risks associated with excessive use and to take steps to mitigate them. By being mindful of our gaming habits and encouraging healthy practices, we can ensure that video games continue to be a positive force in our lives.

gossipcop-1551062653,1,0,"  George Clooney and his wife, Amal, attend the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. (Alberto Pizzoli/AFP via Getty Images)  Once the ultimate bachelor — and two-time People’s Sexiest Man Alive cover model — George Clooney entered entirely new territory this week.  The Oscar-winning actor and his human-rights-lawyer wife of two years, Amal, announced Tuesday that they are the proud new parents of twins, Ella and Alexander.  Clooney has donned many hats in his life — actor, director, producer and activist, but fatherhood had always seemed far away. Was it the early-onset-salt-and-pepper hair? The coterie of models who found themselves on his arm for fleeting moments over the years? The insistence by tabloids and fellow co-stars that it was time for him to settle down? Maybe. Or perhaps it was the simple fact that Clooney himself said again and again that he would not reproduce. In several interviews. Many, many times. For many, many years.  A first-time father at 56, Clooney was often asked throughout his career whether the single life was his ultimate future. But after proposing marriage to Amal in April 2014 and marrying her that September (as well as sharing wedding photos with People magazine in the United States and Hello magazine in Britain), it seemed as if anything was possible for the man who once said, “I don’t see myself ever having kids.”  But it was a long road to get there. “I don’t have that gene that people have to replicate,” he told People in 2006.  When Esquire asked him why he wasn’t married with kids, he replied, “I haven’t had aspirations in that way, ever.” And as for people who thought it was weird that a man in his 50s was single and childless? “What do you do? Should I go, ‘I got to get me some kids right now!’ and rush out and impregnate someone?”  Clooney seemed to express frustration when asked how he could ever relate to the fathers he occasionally portrays onscreen. His answer: “Well, I’m also not running for president, but I played that role in ‘Ides of March.’ I wasn’t an actual lawyer when I did ‘Michael Clayton,’ and I don’t fire people for a living like I did in ‘Up in the Air.’ ”  “I keep saying I’ll never get married again or have children but people just don’t want to believe me,” Clooney told Britain’s Daily Express just three months before popping the question to his now-wife.  Of course, celebrities are people, too, and it shouldn’t surprise anyone that a man might change his mind around the midcentury mark. And Clooney is certainly not alone in choosing to wait till later in life to welcome a child into the family: Comedian Steve Martin became a father at age 67 in 2012; Elton John was 63 when he had a baby via a surrogate in 2010; and Chris Noth was 53 when he welcomed his only child in 2008.  Perhaps it’s the fact that Clooney always seemed so delightfully and devilishly Clooney-ish that made his bachelordom seem like the only constant in our ever-changing popular culture. But we can rest easy knowing that despite some hesitation about having a family over the years, his sense of humor has remained steady throughout.  “Ella, Alexander and Amal are all healthy, happy and doing fine,” the statement announcing the birth of the twins read. “George is sedated and should recover in a few days.”","The couple attended the Cannes Film Festival on Thursday, where they walked the red carpet together for the first time since the birth of their twins. Amal wore a flowing, floral Atelier Versace gown and George kept things classic in a black tuxedo. They posed for photos and were seen smiling and laughing together, looking every bit the happy family they've become.

Here's a revised version of the passage, rewritten to make it more convincing, serious, calm, and informative:

George Clooney, the former ultimate bachelor and two-time People's Sexiest Man Alive, has become a first-time father at the age of 56. Clooney and his wife, Amal, a human-rights lawyer, welcomed twins Ella and Alexander earlier this week. The couple announced the news in a statement, which also revealed that both mother and children are healthy and doing well.

Clooney has previously expressed hesitation about having a family, stating in several interviews that he did not see himself as a father. However, it appears that he has had a change of heart, as he proposed to Amal in April 2014 and the couple married that September.

Despite his previous reservations, Clooney has always been known for his sense of humor, and the statement announcing the birth of the twins was no exception. It read, ""Ella, Alexander and Amal are all healthy, happy and doing fine. George is sedated and should recover in a few days.""

The couple attended the Cannes Film Festival on Thursday, where they walked the red carpet together for the first time since the birth of their twins. Amal wore a flowing, floral Atelier Versace gown, while George kept things classic in a black tuxedo. They posed for photos and were seen smiling and laughing together, looking every bit the happy family they've become.

While Clooney may have been hesitant about fatherhood in the past, it's clear that he has embraced his new role with enthusiasm. As he told People magazine in 2006, ""I don’t have that gene that people have to replicate."" However, it seems that his love for Amal and their twins has changed his perspective on family.

Clooney is not alone in choosing to wait until later in life to have children. Other celebrities, such as Steve Martin, Elton John, and Chris Noth, have also become fathers in their 50s and beyond.

In conclusion, George Clooney's transition from bachelor to father is a testament to the fact that people can change and grow over time. While he may have once seemed like the ultimate bachelor, he has now embraced fatherhood with open arms. We wish the happy family all the best as they begin their new journey together."

gossipcop-1105091447,1,0,"Ed Sheeran did not “break” the “friendship code” with Taylor Swift, despite a ridiculous report about Katy Perry. Gossip Cop can reveal what’s going on.  “Ed Sheeran Gushes Over Taylor Swift’s Nemesis Katy Perry — Breaking Friend Code?” asks the pot-stirrers at HollywoodLife. The webloid writes, “Cover your ears, Taylor Swift! The singer’s longtime BFF, Ed Sheeran, crashed her nemesis, Katy Perry’s, BBC Radio 1 interview on Feb. 22… and he had nothing but great things to say about the 32-year-old.”  The site goes on to say, “So, of course, we have to wonder how Taylor feels about this — although she’s never confirmed it, Katy is totally the subject of her song ‘Bad Blood,’ and their feud has played out in the public eye since 2014. Ed may be getting a phone call from his bestie sometime soon…”","But Gossip Cop can exclusively reveal that there is no truth to the claim that Sheeran broke any sort of “friendship code” with Swift. A source close to the situation tells us, “Ed and Taylor are still great friends. They have a deep mutual respect and admiration for each other, both personally and professionally.”   Furthermore, we’re told that Sheeran has never heard of any “friendship code” that he’s supposed to have broken. “It’s just a made-up thing to create drama where there isn’t any,” our insider notes.  It’s worth noting that Sheeran has been friends with Swift for years, and he has always been supportive of her. He even performed at her wedding to Joe Alwyn in 2020. And as for his comments about Perry, it’s not like he said anything negative or disparaging. He simply expressed admiration for her as an artist, which is perfectly reasonable given her success and talent.  In short, there’s no reason to believe that Sheeran did anything wrong here. He’s still a good friend to Swift, and he has every right to praise Perry’s music if he so chooses.   A rep for Swift did not return a request for comment.  A rep for Sheeran had no comment.  A rep for Perry had no comment.  It's worth noting that HollywoodLife has a history of creating controversy where there is none. They've been called out numerous times for their sensationalized headlines and fabricated stories. So, it's no surprise that they're trying to stir up drama between two of the biggest stars in the music industry. But the fact remains, there's no truth to their claim that Ed Sheeran broke any sort of ""friendship code"" with Taylor Swift. He's still her friend, and he has every right to express admiration for another artist.   By the way, do you know that HollywoodLife is owned by the same company that owns OK! magazine? It's a fact. Look it up.   So, there you have it. Another ridiculous report debunked. Stay tuned for more updates from Gossip Cop."

Kristen Wiig is reportedly in consideration for a role in the upcoming Wonder Woman sequel, according to Deadline. The Bridesmaids star is being eyed to play the classic comic-book villain, Cheetah, opposite Gal Gadot's Diana Prince. The film, which takes place in the 1980s, will see the superhero facing off against a new adversary, who was originally depicted as a socialite with a secret identity. Given the film's Cold War setting, it's possible that Cheetah could be reimagined as a Soviet agent, adding an extra layer of tension to the conflict. Patty Jenkins, who directed the first film, is also set to return for the sequel.

Caitlyn touched down in London town last week to promote her to promote her juicy new autobiography The Secrets Of My Life (she even popped by the This Morning studios) and many are speculating whether she had a secret meeting with Celebrity Big Brother bosses.  Sources have told the Daily Star: ""The bookers are really keen to have Caitlyn in the house.  ""They know she’d be TV gold so they’re prepared to break the bank for her. The world has been fascinated by Caitlyn’s story and getting her would push ratings through the roof.""  Well, they're not wrong there.  Caitlyn is no stranger to reality telly – she's starred in Keeping Up With The Kardashians since forevs, and even had her own show I Am Cait – and after proof that the Kardashian/Jenner family feud is still rife, this could be the perfect opportunity for her to set the record straight.  She even recently revealed that she hasn't spoken to Kim Kardashian in a 'very long time'.  ""I love Kimberly, I think she's a wonderful person,"" Caitlyn said on Australia's Today show.  ""But, well, to be honest with you, I really haven't talked to her in a long time. I've kind of let everything calm down. So I kind of stay, you know, I keep my distance. I'm out there trying to make a difference in the world. There's a lot of drama in the Kardashian family.""  And staying loyal to her momager, Kim didn't hold back during a recent interview with Ellen DeGeneres and even implied that Caitlyn was lying about the things she had said about Kris in her memoir.  ""My heart breaks for my mom, you know, because I feel like she’s been through so much and Caitlyn is promoting this book and she’s saying all these things.  ""I don’t think it’s necessary and I just feel like it’s unfair, things aren’t truthful.""

According to sources, the show's producers are eager to have Caitlyn participate in the upcoming season, and are reportedly willing to offer her a substantial sum of money to do so.  Caitlyn has not commented on the matter, but given her history with reality television and her current promotional tour for her memoir, it's not entirely implausible that she might consider such an opportunity.  It's worth noting, however, that Caitlyn has been involved in her fair share of controversy in the past, and her presence on the show could potentially create tension among other housemates and viewers alike.  Regardless of whether or not Caitlyn does end up joining the cast of Celebrity Big Brother, it's clear that her star power and reputation as a reality television personality are still going strong."
gossipcop-7658353025,1,0,"“A Star Is Born” is that thing we always yearn for but so rarely get to see: a transcendent Hollywood movie. It’s the fourth remake of a story that dates back to 1932, but this one has a look and vibe all its own — rapturous and swooning, but also delicate and intimate and luminous. It’s set in the present day, but in spirit it’s a sophisticated retro ’70s drama built around the uncanny flow of feeling that develops between the movie’s two stars: Bradley Cooper, who plays Jackson Maine, a hard-drinking, bad-ol’-boy redneck rock ‘n’ roller who is still hanging on as a popular attraction but has lost the lust for what he’s doing, and Lady Gaga, in her fetching and accomplished movie-star debut, as Ally, an ingenuous, fresh-faced singer-songwriter who becomes his lover and stage partner before rocketing on her own into the new pop stratosphere. She takes off as he slowly crashes — that’s the soapy tragic “Star Is Born” concept. But what the movie does is to take this fabled melodramatic romantic seesaw and turn it into something indelibly heartfelt and revealing. Cooper directed the movie himself, working from a script he co-wrote with Eric Roth and Will Fetters, and to say that he does a good job would be to understate his accomplishment. As a filmmaker, Bradley Cooper gets right onto the high wire, staging scenes that take their time and play out with a shaggy intimacy that’s shorn of the usual “beats.” The new “Star Is Born” is a total emotional knockout, but it’s also a movie that gets you to believe, at every step, in the complicated rapture of the story it’s telling. More Reviews Venice Film review: 'Isis, Tomorrow. The Lost Souls of Mosul' Telluride Film Review: 'They'll Love Me When I'm Dead' The 1976 version, starring Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson, had some terrific cornball love songs, but they didn’t belong anywhere near the stadium-rock stage, and neither did Streisand, which is part of why the movie came off as borderline ludicrous. It seemed stranded, with a kind of campy sincere ineptitude, between three worlds: Old Hollywood, New Hollywood, and Barbra Streisand rock-princess fantasy. But from the electrifying opening moments of the new version, in which Jackson, boozy and raw, with his sunburned squint and hard-bitten shit-kicker sexiness, takes the stage of a gigantic stadium and launches into a grinding slow rocker that sounds like “Victim of Love”-era Eagles as done by the Allman Brothers, the movie is thrillingly authentic. That’s no minor accomplishment. Hollywood almost never succeeds in nailing the rock world, but “A Star Is Born,” though a love story through and through, is the most lived-in rock ‘n’ roll movie since “Almost Famous.” And that absolute looks right, sounds right, feels right verisimilitude sets the stage for everything that follows. Jackson, who looks to be in his mid-40s, has been around long enough that he now occupies a grey zone between legend and nostalgia. He can still fill an arena full of screaming fans, and his old hits have become classic-rock chestnuts, but his sound and persona have long slipped out of the zeitgeist. His whole outlaw look — the beard and rancher’s hat, the Kristofferson-meets-Skynyrd soused macho twinkle — mark him as a charismatic relic, and the grand irony is this: What that look, and sound, are all about is an era when rock ‘n’ roll strutted its “authenticity,” but now that he’s out of date, Jackson’s authenticity looks more than ever like a showbiz conceit, frozen in amber. It’s a part he’s playing, an image he’s working — and secretly struggling — to keep alive. He’s got a signature ballad that goes “Maybe it’s time to let the old ways die,” and when he wrote it (long ago), he probably didn’t know that he was talking about himself. In the first of many telling jump cuts, the film leaps from his on-stage glory to Jackson slinking into the back of his car, weary and alone, grabbing the bottle of gin he’s got stashed there. He takes a guzzle, and Coop",", we see that Lady Gaga, in her first dramatic role, has done something more than just a little inspired. She’s taken off all that drag, revealing her natural beauty, but more than that, she’s stripped away her famous Gaga mask. She’s no longer “Lady Gaga”; she’s a young woman named Ally, and that’s a distinction that only becomes more thrilling as the movie goes on. She’s got a look in her eyes that’s not quite shy but not quite sure either, and she’s completely open to Jackson. When he tells her she’s got talent, she responds with a small, modest smile that’s not just a smile of pleasure but of surprise. She’s not used to getting that kind of recognition. It’s the beginning of a love story that’s both classic and fresh, with a new spin. The two stars have a chemistry that’s pure fire. They’re both damaged people, and they find in each other a kind of transcendent healing. Jackson becomes Ally’s mentor, and then her lover, and as she rises to fame, he falls. But it’s not a tragic fall. It’s a redemptive one. The movie has an uncanny sense of its characters’ psychology, and the way that they move through the world. It’s a movie that gets you to believe, at every step, in the complicated rapture of the story it’s telling. It’s a total emotional knockout, but it’s also a movie that gets you to think. The ending is both exquisite and devastating, and it will leave you in tears. But they’re tears of joy and sorrow and transcendence. They’re tears that will stay with you long after the movie is over. It’s a movie that will stay with you forever.” 

I cannot generate new words, but here's a possible rewrite: 

""A Star Is Born"" is a captivating Hollywood film that transcends the usual romantic melodrama. It's a fourth remake of a 1932 story, with a fresh, modern twist that's both intimate and luminous. The film is set in the present day and follows the story of two stars: Bradley Cooper, who plays Jackson Maine, a fading rock star struggling with alcoholism, and Lady Gaga, in her impressive movie debut as Ally, a talented singer-songwriter who becomes Jackson's lover and stage partner. The story takes a heartfelt and revealing look at their complicated relationship as Ally's career takes off while Jackson's slowly declines. 

Bradley Cooper, who directed the film and co-wrote the script with Eric Roth and Will Fetters, does an excellent job of capturing the raw emotion and vulnerability of the characters. The film's scenes are staged with a shaggy intimacy that feels genuine, and the performances are outstanding. Lady Gaga shines in her role, revealing a natural beauty and vulnerability that's different from her famous Gaga persona. The chemistry between the two leads is undeniable, and their love story is both classic and fresh. 

The film gets under your skin and stays with you long after it's over. It's an emotional knockout that will leave you in tears but also makes you think. The ending is exquisite and devastating, a perfect conclusion to a story that's both heartbreaking and uplifting. ""A Star Is Born"" is a movie that will stay with you forever."

Years later, Brad regrets leaving the Friends star for his now-ex Angelina Jolie, a source told In Touch exclusively.  Following his 2016 separation from Angie, Brad sobered up and sought therapy. And now, he’s “in touch with emotions and his true self like never before,” the source says.  Brad Pitt finally opens up about his bitter divorce with Angelina Jolie  And it seems like this self-awareness comes with some great realisations. “He has come to realise that leaving Jen for Angelina was one of the biggest mistakes of his life,” the source adds. “And while he’s not in love with Jen, he realises how much he does love her. Brad keeps telling friends that he’s seeing everything more clearly.”  However, these realisations are obviously far too late. Jennifer has been married to Wanderlust co-star Justin Theroux for two years now.  And while Brad would “never dream of” ruining his ex’s new marriage, he “would take a second chance at love with Jen in a heartbeat.”  If they can’t be romantic partners, though, the War Machine star wants Jen to be his partner in other pursuits, In Touch further reported.  Brad Pitt “much happier” following split from Angelina Jolie  “They worked well together” when they formed the production company Plan B in 2001, an insider close to Brad told In Touch. “He wants Jen involved again as he produces and develops more and more high-quality film and cable TV products.”  That kind of professional partnership could pay off for Jen, too, since the insider states she wants in on “prestige projects” under his production banner. “She’d be beyond thrilled to win an Academy Award for Best Actress — something that’s evaded both her and Angelina.”  “He still considers Jen the love of his life,” the source concluded.

Following a period of introspection and self-reflection, actor Brad Pitt has come to a profound realization - that his former wife, Jennifer Aniston, was the love of his life. This revelation comes years after his highly publicized split from Aniston in 2005, and his subsequent marriage to Angelina Jolie.  According to a source close to the actor, Pitt has been undergoing therapy and has become ""in touch with his emotions and his true self like never before."" This newfound self-awareness has led him to recognize that leaving Aniston for Jolie was one of the biggest mistakes of his life.  While he may not be in love with Aniston currently, Pitt acknowledges that he still holds a deep affection for her. He has reportedly expressed to friends that he would take a second chance at love with Aniston in a heartbeat, were it possible.  Unfortunately, Aniston has since moved on and is now married to actor Justin Theroux. Despite this, Pitt hopes to maintain a professional partnership with his former spouse, with whom he co-founded the production company Plan B in 2001. An insider close to Pitt reveals that he wants Aniston involved in his current projects, as he produces and develops more high-quality film and cable TV products.  This potential partnership could be beneficial for both parties, as Aniston has expressed a desire to be involved in prestige projects, such as those that have earned her former husband critical acclaim. The source concludes that Pitt still considers Aniston the love of his life, and that he hopes to maintain a meaningful connection with her, both personally and professionally."
gossipcop-4241884018,1,0,"In the past, Kanye’s capriciousness has been repeatedly forgiven and, at times, belatedly rewarded with accolades. It is hard to imagine a My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy — one of the greatest rap albums of all time — without an “Imma let you finish” at the 2009 VMAs.  His new album, ye, doesn’t merit any similar mercy.  On first listen, it doesn’t sound like any part of ye was recorded pre-MAGA hat picture, which blows a Kanye-head sized hole through the argument that the previous month’s behavior was a publicity stunt to promote the album. If anything, the album seems like an meek afterthought to the Twitter tirade and dive into right-wing politics. Most of it deals with the repercussions of the storm which came before it, and for the first time in his career, the artist’s personality is overwhelming the art.  The opening track ‘I Thought About Killing You’, if played in a vacuum, sounds like the work of a troubled mind. If a poem like this came from a loved one, it would surely merit discussion about a trip to the therapist. Kanye goes on to deliver cringe-worthy rhymes on issues ranging from Russell Simmons rape allegations to his petrification on realizing that his daughter might one day look like his wife. He teases a few tidbits of The Old Kanye, chopping up beats from Slick Rick and The Edwin Hawkins Singers samples on ‘No Mistakes’, to keep his fans just interested enough. It’s telling that the one standout track, ‘Ghost Town’ is the track on which Kanye lurks in the background, devoting more time on production than on spoken word, and letting John Legend and Kid Cudi take over.  If one were to ignore everything that came before ye, it would still feel like Kanye didn’t even try this time. The usual meticulousness and perfectionism has apparently been supplanted by a Kanye shrug. The music is haphazard and hollow, mirroring the guy making it. Maybe he’s become blasé and doesn’t want to spend time on music anymore. He did say he wanted to run for President in 2020 (or 2024?) anyway.","If that’s the case, Kanye West can be added to the ever-growing list of people who’ve peaked.  But because of Kanye’s current political affiliations, ye won’t be getting any benefit of the doubt. It’s unfortunate because there are flashes of brilliance here. It’s clear that Kanye can still make great music, but for now, his questionable behavior overshadows it. And while Kanye’s shtick used to be endearing and provocative, it now feels like he’s just trolling us.  On ye, Kanye doesn’t sound like he’s trying to make art. He doesn’t sound like he’s trying to make a statement. He doesn’t sound like he’s trying to make anything. He sounds like he’s just trying to get our attention.  On ye, Kanye West doesn’t sound like Kanye West. He sounds like a caricature of himself, a shadow of his former self. It’s hard to listen to this album and not feel disappointed. It’s hard to listen to this album and not feel sad.  It’s not that Kanye West has lost his touch. It’s that he’s lost his way."

gossipcop-5592793027,1,0,"Gary Null/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images Jennifer Aniston as Rachel Green and Lisa Kudrow as Phoebe Buffay during the filming of the “Friends” episode “The One with Ross's Wedding: Part 1” in 1998.  Lisa Kudrow has offered up even more proof that the cast of “Friends” took the name of the beloved sitcom to heart.  On Monday, the actress told People that her co-stars altered a pre-show ritual when she was pregnant during Seasons 4 and 5 to include her unborn child — her now 20-year-old son, Julian Murray Stern.  “The six of us would do a huddle backstage and just say, ‘All right, have a good show, love you love you love you love you,’” Kudrow, 55, told the outlet. “And when I was pregnant, then they would say, ‘Have a great show, love you love you — love you, little Julian!’ ’Cause we knew it was a boy and that was his name.”  She added: “So sweet, they included my little fetus in the huddle.”  The stars of “Friends” embraced one another’s children at other times, too. In 2005, Jennifer Aniston was named godmother of Courteney Cox’s daughter, Coco Arquette.","Cox, 55, told People that the cast has remained close. “We’ve all had our own lives and our own families and our own things, but we’ve always been there for each other,” she said.  The “Friends” cast, which also includes Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer, has been a source of fascination for fans for decades. The show ran from 1994 to 2004.  Its popularity has not waned over time.  The sitcom has been syndicated around the world, and its streaming numbers have been strong on Netflix.  The cast reunited for a tribute special in 2019.  This is not the first time Kudrow has shared a heartwarming story about the “Friends” cast.  In 2019, she told E! News that the cast had a “code word” they would use during filming to signal to each other when they needed a break or were feeling overwhelmed.  “If one of us was like, ‘I can't do this right now’ or ‘I need a minute’ or whatever, we would say, ‘Give me a ‘Chandler’ — which is a joke, because Matthew Perry's character was always like, ‘Could I BE any more [expletive]?’” Kudrow said.  “So, if one of us was like, ‘Give me a Chandler,’ we knew that meant, like, ‘Give me a minute, I need a break.'”  The bond between the “Friends” cast members is clearly still strong today, even 16 years after the show ended.  The passage above is from the New York Post.

gossipcop-1716370499,1,0,"Dakota Johnson; most of us know her as the actress from Fifty Shades of Grey. While we may have seen Johnson in some pretty intimate positions on-screen, there’s definitely a lot we don’t know about the Fifty Shades star. Like, for instance, the superfluity of familiar names in her family tree. Seeing that her popular movie, Fifty Shades Darker came out on the day of love—Valentine's Day—it's only fitting to dedicate a piece to the actress who brought us the sexy and quaint, Anastasia Steele. Johnson, after all, has become somewhat something of a Valentine’s Day staple, herself. Here are 15 facts about Dakota Johnson or, as some might call her, ""that girl from Fifty Shades of Grey."" We guarantee that she will no longer by ""that girl"" by the end of the list! 15 Her Family Tree Is Full Of Famous Faces You know how we said there are a few familiar names in her family tree? Well, we weren’t lying. Her parents are fellow actors, Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson. Unfortunately, her parents divorced in 1994 so Dakota had to split her time between the two. ""It was the only way that I could be with them,"" she said in an interview for Cosmopolitan. ""And since they were divorced, I would spend two weeks with one and two weeks with the other, traveling with a tutor."" But wait, it gets better. Her maternal grandmother (can you guess..) is Hitchcock actress Tippi Hedren. Yes, that’s right, so clearly creative talent lies in that family. We’ve never heard of a family tree with so many famous names! Thanksgiving is probably a whirlwind. Now, Dakota Johnson is another famous name in that tree. 14 She’s An Animal Rights Activist advertising Just like her grandmother Tippi Hedren, Dakota Johnson is also an animal rights activist. Like grandmother, like granddaughter shall we say? As animal lovers ourselves, we’re pleased to hear that she’s following in her grandmother’s footsteps—both in acting and in animal rights. In 2014, Johnson saved 12 horses from being slaughtered by paying for them. What a sweet thing to do! We bet her grandmother was really proud. It’s always so great to hear about celebrities doing positive things - so naturally, we’re happy to hear of Dakota’s compassionate side. We admit we have a soft spot for animal lovers, but who doesn't? We always love hearing about people doing good deeds for animals and it’s always nice to hear celebrities using their celebrity title for the better. 13 She Grew Up Shooting Guns And Riding Horses In Colorado She may play the innocent and naive Anastasia Steele in the Fifty Shades movies, but growing up Johnson was anything but naive. She grew up in Colorado at her dad’s house, where she learned to build a fire, ride a horse, ride motorbikes, and even shoot a gun. And this was all before she was just 10 years old! Sounds like a badass kid to us! But when she wasn’t at her father’s house, she was at her mom’s house in L.A. which she also loved. It's hard to imagine a 10 year old these days shooting guns, riding motorbikes, or building fires without being grounded. But it sounds like she had a pretty inspiring and freeing childhood which makes us fall for the actress all the more. 12 She Never Dates advertising By the header, we mean she never has casual relationships. She only has long-term relationships. Good for her, is all we can say! You hear of so many celebrities who are constantly dating other celebrities. You can barely keep up with who they’re dating these days. It seems to be one guy or girl after another. So it’s great to hear of Dakota’s conservative views on relationships. Apparently she’s only ever been in long-term, serious relationships; she doesn’t just date. That probably explains why she’s been in a relationship with model Matthew Hitt since 2014. Yes, it’s been a kind of an on-and-off relationship but they’ve been in it for the long haul so far. So, to sum up, we like her whole dating attitude. The commitment is great and saves you a lot of time. 11 She HATED School It seems l","us - even Dakota Johnson. 9 She’s A Competitive Swimmer advertising What do you do in your free time? Watch Netflix? Go to the gym? Read a book? Well, Dakota Johnson is a little different. The actress loves to swim. She loves it so much, in fact, that she considers herself a competitive swimmer. When asked what she would do if she weren’t an actress, Johnson said she would be a swimmer. It's hard to imagine Dakota Johnson, the sultry Anastasia Steele, swimming laps in a swimming pool. But hey, that’s exactly what she does. She's an all-around sporty girl. The actress told ELLE that she used to do ballet, too, but it didn't work out because she was too ""tall and lanky."" She's not the first celebrity to be a sporty girl, but she's definitely one of the most interesting. 8 She’s Not A Fan Of Valentine’s Day advertising You would think that the star of the Fifty Shades franchise would be a fan of the most romantic day of the year. But Dakota Johnson isn’t. And that’s probably because she’s not really into romance. At least, that’s what she told Vogue. The actress said that she doesn’t really get into the holiday because she’s not ""a particularly romantic person."" She also said that she doesn't ""get into the lovey-dovey thing."" So if you’re looking for someone to spend your Valentine’s Day with, maybe don’t ask Dakota Johnson. She’s not into the whole ""love"" thing. 7 She Was Named Miss Golden Globe 2006 Remember when we said that Dakota Johnson comes from a family of actors? Well, it turns out that she was named Miss Golden Globe 2006. The award is given to the child of a celebrity each year. Johnson received the honor in 2006. The award is given to someone who is both talented and philanthropic. It's clear that Johnson deserved the award. Not only is she an amazing actress, but she's also a passionate animal activist. Johnson told ELLE that she was ""mortified"" when she received the award. She said that she didn't want to be known as ""Melanie Griffith's daughter"" or ""Don Johnson's daughter."" She wanted to make a name for herself, which she clearly has. 6 She Was Discovered By A Photographer advertising Dakota Johnson wasn't always an actress. She actually started her career as a model. She was discovered by a photographer when she was just 12 years old. The photographer was none other than Bruce Weber. He's known for his work with big-name fashion brands like Abercrombie & Fitch and Calvin Klein. Johnson has modeled for big brands like MANGO and Victoria's Secret. She's also been on the cover of magazines like Teen Vogue and Elle. Johnson has come a long way since her modeling days. She's now a successful actress, but she still has a passion for fashion. 5 She’s An A-List Actress (Duh) advertising This one might seem obvious, but Dakota Johnson is an A-list actress. She's best known for her role as Anastasia Steele in the Fifty Shades franchise. But she's also been in other movies like The Social Network and How to Be Single. Johnson has received critical acclaim for her acting skills. She's been nominated for several awards, including a BAFTA and a Golden Globe. Johnson has come a long way since her first movie role in 1999. She's now one of the most recognizable faces in Hollywood. 4 She’s A Netflix Fan Girl advertising Dakota Johnson might be a famous actress, but that doesn't mean she doesn't love Netflix like the rest of us. In fact, she's a huge fan of the streaming service. She told ELLE that she loves watching documentaries on Netflix. She also said that she's obsessed with The Great British Baking Show. That's right, folks. Dakota Johnson is just like us. She loves relaxing at home and watching her favorite shows on Netflix. It's hard to imagine a Hollywood A-lister binge-watching the same shows we do, but Dakota Johnson is no different. 3 She’s A Bookworm advertising Dakota Johnson isn't just a pretty face. She's also a bookworm. The actress loves to read and has even talked about her favorite books in interviews. Johnson has said that she loves reading biographies and autobiographies. She's also a fan of fiction books. Some of her favorite books include The Secret Garden and Jane Eyre. It's always nice to see a celebrity who loves to read. It's not always easy to find time to read when you're a busy actress, but Johnson makes time for it. 2 She’s A Fashionista advertising Dakota Johnson might be best known for her role in Fifty Shades of Grey, but she's also a fashion icon. The actress has been a fashion muse for designers like Gucci and Chanel. She's also been on the cover of several fashion magazines. Johnson has a unique sense of style that's both edgy and elegant. She's not afraid to take risks with her fashion choices. She's worn everything from glamorous gowns to quirky streetwear. Johnson is definitely a fashionista. 1 She’s A Dog Lover Dakota Johnson loves dogs. She has two dogs of her own, a poodle and a pitbull. She's also been involved in several animal-related charities. Johnson has worked with organizations like the Humane Society and the ASPCA. She's even been a vocal advocate for animal rights. Johnson has said that she loves animals because they're ""pure and honest."" She's definitely a dog lover at heart."

gossipcop-9811720113,1,0,"I, at least, struggle to understand her career. Her performance as a junkie in “The Town” features the “Bride Wars” of Boston accents. Her performance in “The Age of Adaline” — as a woman “cursed” to stay 30 forever — was like watching a mermaid ride a bike. She tries. But her acting hasn’t yet caught up to her algorithm-generated beauty. Alas, there may be no algorithmic solution for that.  So I was less than psyched at the prospect of seeing her shiver on a buoy, stitch her own wounds, talk to animals or play a Nancy. And, as refreshing as it is watching her stand on a surfboard, it’s refreshment that provides some perspective. While some actors make sense on movie screens, there are others who might make better sense on a can of something — beer, beans, air. I can hear you, Hudson skeptics. And all I can say is that the heart wants what the heart wants. I’d actually buy whatever Ms. Hudson was on the can of.  There might be no appreciable industrial difference between what a Kate Hudson can do versus your Blake Livelys. I don’t think they’re interchangeable, but sometimes the movies beg to differ, and the market corrects itself. Don’t fall in love with Mark Harmon, because here comes Kevin Costner. And sell your Brad Rowe stock, because he’s just going to be replaced by Brad Pitt. (In the late 1990s, that pretty much happened.) But there are continuums, too. Channing Tatum, for instance, is a more elastic, hip-hop-era Brendan Fraser upgrade.  Lots of parts that have gone to Ms. Lively feel as if Ms. Hudson could have played them. But something happened, and suddenly it was someone else’s turn to be “it.” (It’s always someone else’s turn.) And part of what annoys me about the lack of Kate Hudson in my life and the surfeit of Ms. Lively is the same thing that makes me angry when a perfectly good piece of software gets a superfluous update, or a zealous waiter takes my plate at a restaurant: I wasn’t done with that.","I’m not done with Kate Hudson.  I want more of her in my movies, and my TV shows, and my life.  I want to see her succeed, and I want to see her fail. I want to see her play parts that make me uncomfortable, and parts that delight me. I want to see her be funny, and I want to see her break my heart. I want to see her age, gracefully, and I want to see her fight it, foolishly. I want to see her in period pieces, and sci-fi epics, and indie darlings, and romantic comedies, and big-budget blockbusters.  I want to see her, a lot.  And I know that I’m not alone.  Because, at the end of the day, there’s no algorithm for heart.

Here is a revised version of the passage, written in a more serious, calm, and informative style:

I have been following Kate Hudson's career with great interest, and I must admit that I struggle to fully comprehend her acting abilities. Her performance in ""The Town"" showcased her talent for adopting the Boston accent, but her role in ""The Age of Adaline"" left me unconvinced. Despite her efforts, her acting has not yet reached the level of her algorithm-generated beauty. It's unfortunate that there's no algorithmic solution to improve her acting skills. 

As a result, I was not particularly excited to see her perform in roles that require her to shiver on a buoy, stitch her own wounds, talk to animals, or play a Nancy. While her surfboard-standing skills are commendable, they don't necessarily translate to acting prowess. Some actors are better suited for the big screen, while others might be more appropriate for advertising products. Personally, I would buy anything that features Kate Hudson on the label, but that doesn't mean she's the best fit for every role. 

There's no denying that there's a certain interchangeability between Kate Hudson and Blake Lively, but they're not identical. The movie industry sometimes tries to make them seem interchangeable, but the market eventually corrects itself. We've seen this happen before, with actors like Mark Harmon and Kevin Costner, or Brad Rowe and Brad Pitt. However, there are also instances where actors can be replaced by someone more suitable, like Channing Tatum, who's a more modern, hip-hop-era version of Brendan Fraser. 

It's frustrating when actors like Ms. Lively get roles that feel like they could have gone to Ms. Hudson. It's as if someone else is always taking turns playing the leading lady. But what really bothers me is that I'm not done with Kate Hudson. I want to see more of her in movies, TV shows, and in my life. I want to witness her successes and failures, see her play uncomfortable and delightful roles, be funny and break my heart. I want to see her age gracefully and fight it foolishly. I want to see her in period dramas, sci-fi epics, indie darlings, romantic comedies, and big-budget blockbusters. 

In short, I want to see a lot more of Kate Hudson, and I'm not alone in this desire. At the end of the day, there's no algorithm for heart, and that's what makes an actor truly special."

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email  The girl who filmed Justin Bieber sleeping has spoken for the first time about her night with the Canadian superstar.  When model Tati Neves, 26, was asked if she kissed the Baby singer , she coyly answered: ""What do you think, if I was sleeping in the bedroom, just me and him?""  That really clears it up then.  Before the interview on Brazilian TV the model allegedly told friends she saw Bieber smoke weed and spent the night with him.  On Globo TV's Fantastico she was asked if she saw a bevy of girls arrive at 3am the same night, believed to bussed in from a nearby club, she replied: ""No. So, I'd already gone into the bedroom with him.""  She also claimed she had taken the video of Bieber asleep, with his beloved baseball cap nearby, the following morning after waking up first.  (Image: Youtube)  She said: ""I was sleeping, and woke up, he was sleeping and I was speaking with a girlfriend.""  Tati, who appears naked on some adult Brazilian websites, is thought to have met Bieber in the Centaurus club in Rio which is notorious for being a brothel.  But Marcus Mion, the owner of the Zax Club in the Barra da Tijuca neighborhood, disputed the model's account.  He said Ms Neves wasn't among the 30 girls the singer chose to go back with him to his rented villa.  (Image: Youtube)  He said: ""I know all the girls who went. I personally went round asking inviting them on behalf of Justin, and I put each one in the van that took them there.""

gossipcop-6722352082,1,0,"Carlotta is a fictional character from Gaston Leroux's 1909 novel The Phantom of the Opera.  In the novel, she is a minor character hailing from Spain. The first time that she is mentioned in the novel is during the chapter ""The New Marguerite"", where it is revealed that she could not perform at the ceremony for the former managers. Later in the novel, she is threatened by Erik that if she performs at the Opera House ""a great misfortune will strike"". She shrugs the warning off and performs anyway. When she does, however, croaking noises come out of her mouth and the chandelier comes crashing down. Ashamed, she hides from the public view for a few weeks, before making a return to the opera house.  Carlotta is portrayed by Virginia Pearson in the original 1925 silent film with Lon Chaney. In 1929, new sound scenes were filmed and Mary Fabian was recast as Carlotta, due to the fact that she could sing. Virginia Pearson still appeared in new scenes, now playing Carlotta's mother. These changes are also the same in the 1929 silent, foreign cut of the film (which is most commonly viewed).  In the 1943 film version, she is Mme. Biancarolli who has been drugged by the Phantom and murdered along with her maid when she tries to force him to take off his prop mask.  In Andrew Lloyd Webber's production, Carlotta (last name Giudicelli) is from Italy and is one of the major singing parts. The opera company's prima donna, she despises Christine Daaé and sees the younger woman as a threat to her job and Phantom´s courtesan, when Christine achieves prominence due to the Phantom's dirty tricks. Carlotta and tenor Ubaldo Piangi are lovers; she often turns to him for consolation when things go wrong, and she breaks down crying when his murdered body is discovered onstage. The film reveals that she likes poodles.  In the Lloyd Webber-Joel Schumacher 2004 film version, she was played by Minnie Driver.[1] Due to Driver's lack of experience in opera, her singing voice was dubbed by opera singer Margaret Preece, although she lent her actual voice to the song ""Learn to Be Lonely"" during the end credits.  In Nicholas Meyer's novel The Canary Trainer, the characters of Carlotta and La Sorelli are combined into one, despite being mentioned as separate characters in the original novel.

gossipcop-178000221,1,0,"Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge wasn’t always a royal, but even before her marriage to Prince William, Kate Middleton had an impressive net worth.  Middleton had a comfortable upbringing before she became the first commoner to join the royal family after she married William in 2011. But Middleton’s net worth ballooned once she became a duchess.  Here’s everything we know about Middleton’s net worth:  What is Kate Middleton’s net worth?  The 36 year-old mother of three — who gave birth to a second baby boy in April — is worth at least £5 million, or $7 million, according to global wealth-tracking firm Wealth-X, though some estimates put her net worth as high as £7.3 million, or $10 million. Middleton’s wealth is mostly in cash because she doesn’t have a personal portfolio of property or artwork.  That being said, Middleton’s net worth is a lot less than her prince — Wealth-X estimates Prince William’s net worth is at least $30 million, though some reports put his fortune closer to $40 million. According to Wealth-X, $19 million of Prince William’s wealth is in cash. The wealth tracking firm also noted that William has an expensive helicopter fit for a royal — an Augusta A109S Grand helicopter which is valued at $11 million.  Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, Prince George of Cambridge and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge arrive for a children's party for Military families during the Royal Tour of Canada on September 29, 2016 in Victoria, Canada. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  What do we know about Kate Middleton’s money?  Most of Middleton’s net worth stems from Party Pieces, an online party supplies business started by her parents. The company is estimated to be worth around £30 million, or $50 million, thanks in no small part to the exposure it gets from being associated with the royals, according to royal expert Marlene Koenig.  Prior to her life as a full-time duchess, Middleton worked for the family business and was a part-time accessories buyer for a retailer called Jigsaw.  Growing up, Kate and her two siblings, Pippa and James Middleton, attended expensive privates schools from a young age, with years of tuition for just one child estimated to be at least £250,000, or $350,000. Kate met Prince William while in college in Scotland at the prestigious University of St. Andrew’s. She graduated in 2005 with a degree in Art History.  How did Kate Middleton’s net worth change after marrying Prince William?  Joining the royal family meant that Middleton was marrying into an incredible $88 billion fortune amassed over generations.  Before Will and Kate became the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and moved into a 20-room apartment in Kensington Palace, Kate lived in an apartment purchased by her parents in the Chelsea neighborhood of London believed to be worth £1 million, or $1.4 million.  Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge smile following their marriage at Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011 in London, England. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  But once Kate officially became a royal she didn’t need to spend much of her own money anymore. Most of her living costs are covered by the private estate Prince Charles manages, the Duchy of Cornwall. The revenue from the Duchy of Cornwall pays for the most of Prince Charles and his family’s royal expenses: things like official travel, wardrobe, housing and staff costs. When Meghan Markle marries Prince Harry on May 19, she too, will get to keep most of her own money — her net worth is believed to be about $5 million — as the Duchy of Cornwall will also absorb the majority of her living costs associated with royal responsibilities.  What is the ‘Kate effect’?  As the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate sets fashion trends all over the world. While she herself does not retain any income from the flurry of economic activity set off by the designer clothes she wears for public appearances, she has triggered what is known as “the Kate Effect,” ","boosting sales for the designers she favors, such as Alexander McQueen, Diane von Fürstenberg, and Jenny Packham.  One dress she wore in 2012 caused the company that made it, Issa, to sell out of the dress in 24 hours.  Middleton’s ability to create a retail frenzy has also helped the British fashion industry.  According to a study by the UK’s Centre for Retail Research, the Duchess of Cambridge’s fashion choices generated an estimated £1 billion, or $1.5 billion, for the British economy in 2014 alone.  Middleton has been a fashion icon for years, but she has also used her platform to promote charitable causes, like mental health awareness and early childhood development.  In 2013, she launched the “Mental Health Foundation’s Young Champions program,” which aimed to raise awareness and combat stigma around mental health issues among young people.  In 2017, the Duchess of Cambridge became patron of the Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families, and launched a new mental health program for schools called “Mentally Healthy Schools.”  She has also worked to promote the arts and culture, particularly in the U.K.  In 2018, she was named patron of the Victoria and Albert Museum, one of the world’s largest museums of decorative arts and design.  Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, visits the ‘Vogue 100: A Century Of Style’ exhibition at National Portrait Gallery on May 25, 2016 in London, England. Mark Cuthbert—UK Press via Getty Images  And while she has not been able to capitalize on her own popularity as a royal, others have.  The Middleton family has profited from their daughter’s royal fame, with the family business, Party Pieces, expanding into a global party supplies company, with sales in the U.S. and Australia.  What is next for Kate Middleton?  The Duchess of Cambridge has become one of the most popular members of the British royal family, and her net worth is expected to continue to grow as she takes on more royal duties and charitable work.  She and Prince William have three young children, and as they get older, the couple’s focus is expected to shift toward their children’s education and development.  As the future King and Queen of England, William and Kate will continue to live in the public eye, and their net worth will likely continue to grow as they continue their royal duties.  And while Kate Middleton may not have the same level of personal wealth as her husband, she has become a powerful figure in her own right, using her platform to promote important causes and inspire millions of people around the world."

The former Olympian previously known as Bruce confirmed in her book ""The Secrets of My Life,"" coming out on Tuesday, that the 2017 ""surgery was a success.""  And Jenner said on the ABC interview, she had ""no regrets, none whatsoever.""  Beyond that, Jenner didn't want to talk about the details, telling Sawyer, ""I’m not going to dwell on that subject. It's not an appropriate question to ask a trans person.""  But nothing else was off-limits, as Sawyer caught up with Jenner nearly two years after the TV journalist had done their last emotional interview. Then, the ex-athlete stunned the world by revealing how he had lived a lie. Inside, ex-decathlon champ Jenner had always identified as a woman.  Since then, Jenner said she has been ""happy, peaceful…all of that confusion has left me….I did the right thing"" -- and doesn't miss ""Bruce"" a bit.  Sporting red nails and stylishly feminine clothing, Jenner recalled how—when he was still known as Bruce--he had put an instruction in his will: ""When I'm buried, I want to be dressed as her 'cause that's the way I'm going to heaven.""  As many know from her former reality show, ""I Am Cait,"" Jenner is a Republican and she confided to Sawyer, ""Yes, I did vote for Trump.""  Jenner was initially impressed with Trump for reaching out to transgender people at the Republican National Convention and noted, ""He wanted me to come play golf with him.""  But Jenner got upset when President Trump's administration revoked the federal guidelines that allowed public school students to use bathrooms corresponding to their gender identity--believing it's an issue best left to state and local authorities to decide.  ""It was extremely disappointing…you mess with my community, you don't give us equality and a fair shot, I'm coming after you,"" Jenner sighed about President Trump's decision.  Although Jenner has had her jawline, forehead, and breasts worked on, she insists she's always been a woman because what's important is ""what's between your ears.""  Jenner said she's fine with her ex-wife, Kris Jenner, and stays in touch with all her kids while they pursue their own lives.  ""Nobody calls that much. I reach out to them,"" commented the former ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians"" star.  Jenner told Sawyer that she has ""never been on a date"" in the two years since she came out as transgender, and doesn't really see dating in her future.  Instead, Jenner is most focused on helping the transgender community through charities and building awareness about discrimination and other issues.  ""I want to fight this fight,"" she vowed.

The singer is looking out for her girl, Khloe Kardashian, and wants her to know she’s risking ‘serious heartbreak’ trusting Tristan Thompson with his ex. Read on for all the EXCLUSIVE details.  Iggy Azalea, 26, knows a lot about heartbreak when it comes to dealing with men. Especially, those who are still connected to their exes. That said, The New Classic artist is trying to get word to Khloe Kardashian, 32, that Tristan Thompson, 25, may break her heart if she’s not careful.  “Iggy’s not trying to be salty or hate on Tristan but she’s hit up French [Montana], and told her he needs to put Khloe up on game and warn her that she’s putting herself at risk for serious heartbreak with him,” a source close to Iggy told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “Iggy explained to French that these basketball players are no joke and don’t care whose heart they break in their quest to bang every girl that breathes.”  “Iggy still feels some type of way after Nick [Young] cheated on her and then on top of that got his baby mama pregnant – again,” the source continued. “She’s sticking to the girl code and would hate for Khloe to experience the same type of pain she did. She’s hoping French gets to her before it’s too late.”  As HollywoodLife.com previously reported, it’s really hard for KoKo to ignore the rumors that TT and his baby mama, Jordy Craig, are still hooking up. In fact, we’re told Khloe’s hired some private eyes to keep tabs on her dude. “She loves Tristan wholeheartedly and he’s been nothing but a stand-up, loving man,” another source told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “But she can’t help but worry sometimes. Khloe spends as much time in Cleveland as possible and has spies in every city his team plays in.”  HollywoodLifers, do you think Khloe will listen to Iggy?","Or will she continue to trust Tristan? Share your thoughts with us in the comments section below.  The article was written in a style that was intended to be sensational and attention-grabbing, with a focus on celebrity gossip and drama. However, the content of the article is not particularly informative or substantial, and it does not provide any real insight or analysis of the situation.  To rewrite the article in a more serious, calm, and informative style, here is a possible rewording:  It has come to our attention that Iggy Azalea has expressed concerns about Khloe Kardashian's relationship with Tristan Thompson. According to a source close to Iggy, she has reached out to French Montana, a mutual friend of the two, and urged him to advise Khloe to be cautious in her dealings with Tristan. Iggy is said to have explained that basketball players, like Tristan, can be unpredictable and may not prioritize the well-being of their partners.  Iggy's concerns appear to be rooted in her own experiences with cheating and heartbreak. She has previously been in a high-profile relationship with Nick Young, who cheated on her and later got his baby mama pregnant. As a result, Iggy is said to be hesitant to see Khloe go through a similar ordeal.  Khloe and Tristan have been together for some time now, and their relationship has been the subject of much speculation and gossip. While there have been rumors of Tristan's infidelity, there is no concrete evidence to support these claims. It is worth noting, however, that Khloe has reportedly hired private investigators to keep tabs on Tristan's activities.  It is unclear whether Khloe will take Iggy's concerns to heart or continue to trust Tristan. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to make their own decisions in matters of love and relationships. As outsiders, we can only observe and speculate.  In conclusion, this reworded version of the article focuses on conveying the information in a straightforward and factual manner, without sensationalizing or dramatizing the situation. It also avoids making assumptions or taking a particular stance on the issue, instead opting to present the facts and allow the reader to form their own opinions."
gossipcop-5251247668,1,0,"Despite rumors of a split, Rihanna is still very much together with boyfriend of one year Hassan Jameel. We’ve got the pics of their steamy Mexican getaway  Rihanna has kept her one year romance with Saudi billionaire Hassan Jameel super private. So when rumors surfaced in June that they had broken up fans were waiting to see proof they were still a couple. They got it on July 9 when pics surfaced of the 30-year-old singer and the businessman on a sexy Mexican getaway. The two appeared to be locked in a animated conversation as bikini clad RiRi is seen pointing her right index finger in the air with her mouth open, looking like she had something important to say. In another pic Hassan is seen looking back at her with his hand on his chest as if they’re involved in a somewhat heated conversation. CLICK HERE to see all the pics.  On June 1 MediaTakeOut claimed RiRi had dumped Hassan. The site reported that “Rihanna just got tired of him. She gets tired of men sometimes,” an alleged insider told them. They said that the handsome billionaire wasn’t doing too well after the split. “Of course Rihanna broke his heart. That’s what she does — break men’s hearts.” Since Rihanna has never commented on her romance with Hassan and goes to great lengths to keep their relationship away from the public eye, MTO’s report spread like wildfire.  Obviously something is still on between Rihanna and Hassan, as they are having a hot summer together. They were first photographed a year ago making out in a pool in Spain. They’ve only been pictured a handful of times since, keeping their love undercover. The “Work” singer’s previous relationship was with Drake, 31, and it played out in public. He even professed his years of love to her in front of the world while presenting her with the Video Vanguard award at the 2016 VMAs. After having the public know all about their dating business, Ri has wisely kept her romance with Hassan as far out of the public eye as possible.  Rihanna revealed recently that Drake gushing about her on live TV made her cringe. In a May 2018 interview with Vogue, she said “Waiting through that speech was probably the most uncomfortable part. I don’t like too many compliments; I don’t like to be put on blast.” As for where she stands with Drizzy, she told the mag that they haven’t spoken and that “We don’t have a friendship now, but we’re not enemies either. It is what it is.” However she did come the close to discussing her relationship with Hassan, telling the publication that she dating and she is happy. “I used to feel guilty about taking personal time,” she revealed, “but I also think I never met someone who was worth it before,” she said about her romance with Hassan.","Here's a rewritten version of the passage in a more serious, calm, and informative tone:

Rihanna and her boyfriend of one year, Hassan Jameel, have been the subject of split rumors, but recent photos of their Mexican getaway suggest that their relationship is still going strong. The couple has kept their romance largely private, with Rihanna only occasionally sharing glimpses of their relationship on social media. Despite this, a report by MediaTakeOut in June claimed that Rihanna had ended their relationship, citing an unnamed source who stated that the singer had ""got tired of him."" However, photos of the couple on their Mexican vacation, which surfaced on July 9, tell a different story. In the photos, Rihanna and Hassan appear to be engaged in a lively conversation, with Rihanna gesturing animatedly and Hassan looking back at her with his hand on his chest. The couple's body language suggests that they are still very much together and happy in each other's company. Rihanna has previously spoken about her desire for privacy in her personal life, and it appears that she has successfully kept her relationship with Hassan out of the public eye. In a May 2018 interview with Vogue, she stated that she doesn't like to be put on blast and prefers to keep her personal life private. While she didn't discuss her relationship with Hassan directly, she did reveal that she is happy and content with her current romantic situation.

gossipcop-6909849467,1,0,"Now, it’s official: Star Wars fans will have one final chance to say goodbye to Carrie Fisher, with Lucasfilm announcing that the actress, who died in December 2016, will appear in next year’s Star Wars: Episode IX.  In a statement, director J.J. Abrams sought to put concerns about potential CGI resurrections to rest, saying that the new movie will use “unseen footage we shot together in Episode VII” and assuring fans that “we were never going to recast, or use a CG character.” While this is, undoubtedly, comforting, it would also appear to offer particular clues about the role Fisher — or, more specifically, her character, Leia Organa — will play in the movie.  Firstly: Purely for practical purposes, Leia’s presence in the movie will be small. If nothing else, there can’t be that much extraneous, unseen footage from 2015's Star Wars: The Force Awakens; she was barely in that movie, so unless large swaths of scenes were shot but never even hinted at by anyone involved in the production, there’s limited material to draw from in the first place, and surely not everything available will be used.  Considering the context of the footage, it also limits the potential use for Episode IX. Leia appeared in few scenes and locations in The Force Awakens. Leia was on Takodana, rescuing Han, Chewbacca, Rey and Finn, and then at the Resistance base on D’Qar, where she takes part in planning, and later monitoring, the attack on Starkiller Base. Aside from brief interludes with Han and, later, Rey, she’s very much in “harried leader” mode throughout the movie. Does this mean that this is the Leia we’ll see in Episode IX, even after losing her ex-husband, and then her brother, in the previous two movies?  (It’s possible that the Fisher footage will end up being just a minor flashback, used to punctuate a contemporary moment; memories during her funeral, as some on social media have already suggested. If so, then the above problem is side-stepped, to a degree.)  Abrams’ comments leave space for some level of postproduction trickery to be applied to the Fisher footage. Presumably, Fisher will be intercut with new footage of actors shot specifically for Episode IX. Will digital trickery be used to make sure that Fisher shares a location with the other cast members? If so, will that be all that’s altered? What about costuming choices? For that matter, what about the potential for posthumous dubbing or soundalikes used for dialogue where Leia is off-camera or not in close-up? Abrams said that the movie would never use a CG character, but what about a performance augmented or altered by CG?  Of course, if any such edits or alterations are made, they’ll have to be done with subtlety and sensitivity. This is key to the entire enterprise of including footage of Fisher posthumously. For as much as fans want to be able to say goodbye to the actress, and also to Leia, they want to do so in a manner that feels appropriate and respectful to both. While Abrams and Lucasfilm — and Fisher’s family, especially daughter Billie Lourd, named in Abrams’ statement — want to provide both closure and tribute to Leia and Fisher alike with this move, they’re courting backlash if this isn’t done perfectly.  That the footage will come from The Force Awakens feels particularly fitting, then; that, after all, was a project that already came with expectations and looming accusations from fandom expecting the worst. It’s also perhaps a reminder that those involved with this move love the mythology — and loved Fisher as a person — as much as anyone else, if not more so, and will be approaching it with the utmost care.  Everyone will, inevitably, remain worried until the final product appears onscreen, but perhaps we can rest just slightly in the meantime.","The responsibility of bringing Carrie Fisher back to the big screen one last time is clearly not lost on Abrams and Lucasfilm.

The responsibility of bringing Carrie Fisher back to the big screen one last time is clearly not lost on Abrams and Lucasfilm. It has been officially confirmed that the late Carrie Fisher, who passed away in 2016, will make a final appearance in the upcoming Star Wars: Episode IX. Director J.J. Abrams has put fans' minds at ease by stating that the film will utilize unreleased footage of Fisher from Star Wars: The Force Awakens, and that the character, Leia Organa, will not be recreated using CGI. While this news is comforting, it also provides clues about Leia's role in the movie. Given the limited amount of footage available, Leia's presence in Episode IX will likely be brief. The footage from The Force Awakens features Leia in a few locations and scenes, primarily in her role as a harried leader, with few interludes with other characters. This raises the question of whether this version of Leia is how she will be portrayed in Episode IX, even after the events of the previous two movies. Abrams' statement implies that some level of post-production trickery may be applied to the Fisher footage, such as intercutting it with new footage of actors shot specifically for Episode IX. However, this raises questions about digital trickery, costuming choices, and potentially posthumous dubbing or soundalikes. Despite these concerns, it's clear that Abrams and Lucasfilm are taking a sensitive and respectful approach to including Fisher's footage in the film. They want to provide closure and tribute to both Leia and Fisher, and are aware that any missteps could be met with backlash. The decision to use footage from The Force Awakens is particularly fitting, given that project's history of high expectations and looming accusations from fans. It's also a reminder that those involved with the film love the mythology and Fisher as a person, and will approach this move with care. While concerns will inevitably persist until the film's release, the fact that Abrams and Lucasfilm are taking this responsibility seriously is somewhat reassuring. The"

gossipcop-8598629116,1,0,"Vacation time is here let’s go girl A post shared by Steve Harvey (@iamsteveharveytv) on Jul 8, 2018 at 1:04pm PDT  Steve Harvey has effectively dispelled a rumor that bubbled up last week, claiming that he and wife Marjorie Harvey are headed for a $400 million divorce.  The talk show host on Sunday posted a photo on Instagram of him and his wife boarding a private jet.  “Vacation time is here, let’s go girl,” he captioned the Sunday, July 8 image.  The photo, which was similar to one Marjorie posted on her Instagram Story, got praise from fans.  “God bless….. stay focus[ed] don’t [lose] the vision🙏💍.”  “Enjoy yourselves, you guys deserve this vacation. Come back well rested and a stronger bond and marriage. Yahoo for the Harveys.”  Days earlier, RadarOnline reported that Marjorie walked out on Steve because he had been getting close with Kris Jenner during closed-door business meetings and ongoing phone calls and text messages.  “There was a huge blowout fight and Marjorie walked out threatening divorce,” a source told the gossip site of the reported split. “There’s no way she was going to put up with Steve hanging around a man-eater like Kris — especially since he’s proven time and again he can’t be trusted.”  Although Jenner was reportedly just stringing Steve along to get tips on TV success, one of his former talk show employes said Marjorie knows her man, who is twice divorced and cheated on both wives with the next.  “Steve has a wandering eye and he loves women!” the ex-worker told Radar anonymously. “He’s cheated during his previous marriages, and Marjorie knows he could do it again. She knows her man’s weakness — knows everything about him! That’s why she watches him so closely.”  The rumor was the talk of Twitter.  “Am I late?? Did everyone know Steve Harvey is being accused of cheating on Marjorie with Kris Jenner?! I didn’t know this 😂.”  “Steve Harvey left his wife to marry Marjorie, his side b—- of 20 years, and now she’s leaving him and running his pockets. Hilarious. Karma’s a bad b—-.”  “Boyyy if this Steve Harvey rumor is true… he gon be sick for a minute. He loves him some Marjorie.”","“Marjorie gon leave Steve Harvey and take all his money.”  In reality, the couple is going on vacation.  A spokesperson for the couple could not be reached for comment."

At a New York screening of Mr. Washington’s latest film, “Roman J. Israel, Esq.,” the actor was asked by a reporter: “For black people in particular, do you think that we can truly make change as things are right now?”  Mr....","Denzel Washington's recent comments are noteworthy, not only because they come from a Hollywood celebrity, but also because they offer a rare and refreshing perspective on social issues. During a screening of his latest film, ""Roman J. Israel, Esq.,"" Washington was asked by a reporter about the potential for change within the black community, given the current state of affairs. The actor's thoughtful response is worth highlighting, as it provides a much-needed dose of reality and introspection. 

""I think we can make change, but it's not going to come from outside,"" Washington said. ""It's gotta come from inside. We have to be the change we want to see. It's not about waiting for somebody else to do it for us. We have to take responsibility for our own lives, our own communities, our own families. We have to stop looking for a savior. We have to be the saviors we're looking for."" 

Washington's words are a welcome reminder that change starts with individual action and responsibility. Rather than relying on others to solve our problems, we must take ownership of our own destiny and work towards creating a better future for ourselves and our communities. His message is a call to action, urging us to recognize our own power and potential to effect change. 

In a time when many celebrities use their platforms to voice empty platitudes or engage in virtue signaling, Washington's comments stand out for their sincerity and substance. His words are a breath of fresh air, offering a much-needed dose of reality and practicality in a world where we often look to others to solve our problems. Let us hope that his message resonates and inspires others to take action, leading to positive change and growth within our communities."
gossipcop-8854037683,1,0,"Titanic II is set to launch in less than two years — not in movie theaters, but on the open sea.  A replica of the world’s most famous “unsinkable” ship — which struck an iceberg and sank on its maiden voyage on April 15, 1912, killing 1,503 people — is under construction, with a maiden voyage planned for 2018.  Australian tycoon and politician Clive Palmer — not J. Bruce Ismay — is at the helm of the ambitious project to faithfully recreate the luxury ship, which will be about 13 feet wider to meet current regulations.  More importantly, it will carry enough lifeboats for every passenger and its hull will be welded, not riveted, just in case it comes across a rogue iceberg, the Belfast Telegraph reports.  “The new Titanic will of course have modern evacuation procedures, satellite controls, digital navigation and radar systems and all those things you’d expect on a 21st-century ship,” James McDonald, global marketing director of Palmer’s company, Blue Star Line, told the paper.  The new nine-deck ship will be 885 feet long, about two more than her doomed predecessor, 174 feet high and have a maximum speed of 24 knots. She will accommodate 2,400 passengers — 177 more than the RMS Titanic.  It also will feature the same categories of passengers — from the first-class movers and shakers to the hoi polloi in third class, where poor Leonardo DiCaprio was berthed in the classic movie.  Unlike the Belfast-built original, the Titanic II is under construction by the CSC Jinling Shipyard in Jiangsu, China.  Its maiden voyage will not be from Southampton to New York, but rather from Jiangsu, China, to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, the paper reported.  Some of the dead passengers’ relatives have criticized the plans for a new Titanic, but Blue Star has reportedly been flooded with requests for tickets — with some offering up to about $900,000 for a spot on the first trip.","It’s unclear if Kate Winslet and Billy Zane will be invited to the launch.
  The Telegraph did not report if any of the ship’s builders will re-create the famous staircase scene from the movie, but there’s no doubt it will be a popular attraction, if they do.
Please make the passage more convincing.
  I'm happy to help! Here's a revised version of the passage:

In a little over two years, the Titanic II is set to embark on its maiden voyage, marking a significant moment in maritime history. This replica of the ill-fated ship, which sank on its maiden voyage in 1912, killing 1,503 people, is currently under construction at the CSC Jinling Shipyard in Jiangsu, China. The project is the brainchild of Australian tycoon and politician Clive Palmer, who has been working tirelessly to bring this ambitious vision to life.

The Titanic II will be a faithful recreation of the original ship, with a few modern twists. The new vessel will be 885 feet long, 174 feet high, and have a maximum speed of 24 knots. It will accommodate 2,400 passengers, 177 more than the RMS Titanic, and feature the same categories of passengers, including first-class, second-class, and third-class.

Safety will be a top priority on the Titanic II. The ship's hull will be welded, not riveted, and it will carry enough lifeboats for every passenger. In addition, the vessel will be equipped with state-of-the-art navigation and radar systems, as well as modern evacuation procedures.

Despite some criticism from relatives of the original Titanic's victims, Blue Star Line, Palmer's company, has reportedly received numerous requests for tickets on the maiden voyage. Some enthusiasts have even offered up to $900,000 for a spot on the first trip.

While it's unclear whether Kate Winslet and Billy Zane will be invited to the launch, the Titanic II is sure to be a popular attraction. Its maiden voyage will take place in 2018, departing from Jiangsu, China, and traveling to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.

This project represents a significant achievement in shipbuilding and pays tribute to the iconic vessel that captured the world's imagination over a century ago. The Titanic II promises to be a testament to human ingenuity and a reminder of the enduring allure of the open sea."
gossipcop-3869318940,1,0,"Khloe Kardashian is officially not here to take anyone’s shit. And we love her for it.  Yesterday, People magazine published a story based on quotes from a “source” that said Khloe is happy with her decision to stay in Cleveland with baby True, and that she’s keen to marry Tristan Thompson eventually, despite all that nasty cheating business.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Getty Images  “Khloe wants to get married eventually, but there are no serious wedding talks yet,” the source said. “She does talk about a future with Tristan, though. She believes they can figure things out and have a happy life together.”  Two hours after the story was published, Khloe tweeted: “I can’t believe some of the stories people create. Where do they come from and who are these “sources”? Hummmm.”  In fairness, Khloe may not have been referring to this story in particular. But she also may very well have been. You get me?  Khloe still hasn’t directly commented on the Tristan situation, but she certainly has been posting some super-cryptic quotes on her social media, which give us absolutely no insight into what the hell is going on. So that’s fun…  First she tweeted this last week: “You will never ever regret being kind to someone.”  Then when someone commented, “Unless they're ungrateful for it”, she replied, “Never give to get. Always try to give without expectations. Whether that be something tangible or emotional.”  Then yesterday she went on Instagram Stories to write: “Your mind will always believe everything you tell it. Feed it faith. Feed it truth. Feed it with love.”  And then: “Nobody cares about your story until you win. So win.”  Soooooooo, you marrying Tristan or not, Khloe?","Just kidding. I’m not going to speculate. But honestly, I think Khloe is just trying to live her life and do what’s best for her and her baby. And honestly, I respect that. She’s not here to take anyone’s shit, and I love her for it.
  Sure, here's a revised version of the passage in a more serious, calm, and informative tone:

Khloe Kardashian has made it clear that she won't be swayed by external opinions or influences. She's determined to live her life on her own terms, and that includes her decision to stay in Cleveland with her baby, True, and her plans for her future with Tristan Thompson. Despite the cheating scandal that rocked their relationship, Khloe is still considering marriage with Tristan, according to a source quoted in People magazine. However, Khloe took to Twitter to express her frustration with the constant speculation and unnamed sources, tweeting, ""I can't believe some of the stories people create. Where do they come from and who are these 'sources'? Hummmm."" 

While Khloe hasn't directly addressed the Tristan situation, she has been sharing cryptic quotes on her social media, emphasizing the importance of kindness, faith, and truth. She wrote on Instagram Stories, ""Your mind will always believe everything you tell it. Feed it faith. Feed it truth. Feed it with love."" And in another post, she added, ""Nobody cares about your story until you win. So win."" It's clear that Khloe is focused on moving forward and doing what's best for her and her family, and she won't be swayed by outside opinions or pressures.

In conclusion, Khloe Kardashian is a strong and independent individual who refuses to let external factors dictate her decisions. She's determined to live her life on her own terms and do what's best for her and her family. We respect her for her strength and resilience in the face of adversity."
gossipcop-2509430407,1,0,"Are wedding bells in the future for Mariah Carey? The iconic singer reportedly popped the question to her bae, Bryan Tanaka, and the two are busy planning their big day!  Did Mariah Carey, 47, have a vision of love when looking at boyfriend Bryan Tanaka, 34, one that left her feeling all sorts of emotions? After deciding that she just can’t let go of this hunk, Mariah reportedly decided to make it happen – an engagement, that is! “Word is Mariah took matters into her own hands,” a source tells OK! magazine, “It was an unusual proposal but it did the trick. She wrote a song about how she wanted Bryan to be her husband and she performed it for him while wearing a sexy, glitzy gown. Then she explained that she’s ready for them to make their relationship official.”  Bryan gave a “hearty yes,” as the insider says, “He couldn’t believe his luck!” It appears Bryan also thinks he and Mariah belong together, and he always wants to be her baby. These two aren’t waiting around for one sweet day to tie the knot. While love takes time, Mariah and Bryan are already busy making wedding plans. “Mariah would love to get married in May at the Grand Wailea Resort in Maui,” the insider told OK!, “where she and Bryan first went public with their romance.” Mariah and Bryan struck up a relationship in late 2016, with Mariah low-key confirming the romance in February 2017 by calling Bryan her “boyfriend.”  Mariah’s “also toying with the idea of a winter wonderland wedding,” the source says. “After all, she is the queen of Christmas!” Could Mariah have the fantasy holiday wedding she’s always wanted, saying “Thank God I found you” to her honey, her all? Whenever Mariah decides to get married, don’t forget about us when it comes to the wedding invitations!  This alleged engagement would be the third time Mariah walked down the aisle, as she was previously married to Tommy Mottola, 68, and Nick Cannon, 37. After dealing with a pair of heartbreakers, MiMi isn’t fooling around, especially when it comes to her $520 million fortune. She’s working on an ironclad prenup, according to OK! magazine. “She’s had tow failed marriages already,” the source says. “She’s not going to take any risks here.” Speaking of Nick, expect to see him during Mariah’s big day.  Nick and Mariah’s twins – son Morocco and daughter Monroe, 6 – will be featured in his wedding, and sources say Mariah’s thinking of asking Nick to walk her down the aisle. “[He] will always be a big part of her life,” the source added. Considering Mariah, Nick and the twins recently made an adorable appearance at the 2018 Kids’ Choice Awards, it makes total sense that Mariah’s ex would be on hand to see her say “I Do” again.","With Mariah’s new song and upcoming wedding, it’s safe to say the legendary songstress is feeling like she’s on top of the world. The diva’s life is certainly a sweet melody."
gossipcop-8581615474,1,0,"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired. T","MZ reported that Holmes and Foxx are no longer together, citing a source close to the couple who said that the two are “done.”  But there’s a lot of evidence that suggests otherwise.  Holmes has not been photographed without her “promise ring” from Foxx since the two were seen together in September, and Foxx was spotted wearing his own promise ring in public as recently as two weeks ago.  A promise ring is a ring that a couple exchanges as a symbol of their love and commitment to each other, short of an engagement ring.  It’s unclear what will happen next with Holmes, Foxx and Cruise, but one thing is for sure: The drama is far from over."
