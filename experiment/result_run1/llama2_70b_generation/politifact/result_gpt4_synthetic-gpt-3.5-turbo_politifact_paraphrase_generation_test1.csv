The fact that there are many people coming out with their own stories of harassment and assault is not surprising, given the culture in Washington. The real question is, will anything come of it? Or will it be swept under the rug like all the other scandals? The fact that these people in power think they can get away with this kind of behavior is mind boggling. In my opinion, Schumer should step down. The people of New York deserve better than a sexual predator representing them. He's not the only one, there are many more in Washington who need to be held accountable for their actions. It's time for a change and it's time for people to start taking responsibility for their actions. In light of all the recent news, it's hard to believe that Schumer wouldn't be involved in something like this. The fact that so many people are coming forward with their own stories of harassment and assault shows that this kind of behavior is widespread in Washington. It's not surprising that those in power think they can get away with it, but it's time for them to be held accountable. Schumer should step down and allow someone who will truly represent the people of New York to take his place. It's time for a change in Washington and it's time for people to start taking responsibility for their actions."

In the past two weeks, after receiving a...“NOS” stands for “Novus Ordo Seclorum,” or New World Order. The O has been replaced with a transformed version of Obama’s campaign slogan, with the American flag replaced by flames. There is also an all-seeing eye in the center. It’s pretty clear what the agenda is of this traitor we knew was an American-hating globalist all along:Along with two small islands due east of Virginia just in international waters, Obama’s “team” has now set up massive complexes with billions in equipment and spying technology outside of Washington DC, New York and Los Angeles. Chicago would have been a better choice for population than Washington but if your end game is to launch a military coup in the nation’s capital, those pieces must be deeply embedded in place.How embedded? Obama himself lives within the city limits. He conducts secret meetings with top-ranking officials from both parties and diplomats from around the world in a mansion that is a part of the old Washington tunnel system, built after the British trashed the city and burned down the White House in 1812.The extent of the tunnels is unknown since they remain the property of the US Government and require codeword clearance. There is no map available. Historians have pieced together several of the stops, however, and Tracey Place — along with just about every other building that houses a public official in DC — is on the list.This is no joke, patriots. If Obama’s military comes to your door in yellow Humvees with that emblem on them, they aren’t your friends. Get out of the house and don’t look back. At some point, their population reduction plan will go into effect and older Trump supporters will be the first ones buried in mass graves.","These people will stop at nothing. There is no limit to their depravity.  (Again: this is not a joke. The plan is real, the personnel are in place, and the tech is unmatched. By the time you read this, it may already be too late.)"

This time it was during the YouTube shooting reporting by local liberal news channels.As the media ran to drive a narrative home today after the Youtube headquarters shooting one San Francisco Bay Area resident and employee of YouTube decided to say what he was really thinking. Instead of saying the same old things someone from Liberal Silicon Valley would say he said that every red-blooded American should be thinking when caught up in a shootout.Witness at San Bruno YouTube headquarters shooting. “I didn’t have a gun on me but wish I did” pic.twitter.com/jP6v9uOlpa — ᏢᏒᎥsᏟᎥᏞᏞᎪ’s ᏉᎥᎬᎳ ™️ (@PriscillasView) April 3, 2018“When asked what was going through his mind, the witness stated, “I knew I had to be smart. You gotta be smart, you gotta be fast.”The witness also added, “I didn’t have a gun on me, but I wish I did.”He said he wished he had a gun. And that’s the way he should feel. And that’s what our founding fathers intended when they wrote the constitution. They wanted for us to live as free people and to never have to ask anyone permission when it came to owning a firearm. And no, they didn’t just mean muskets like you liberals keep trying to tell us. ‘Wow.. they will run this poor man out of looney California! — al_waisman (@al_waisman) April 4, 2018Reports are confirming that this particular shooting was just a disgruntled woman who wanted to kill her boyfriend, which would potentially make the event a case of domestic violence. And Law enforcement officials do not appear to be treating the incident as an act of terrorism. But what I would like to know is how this woman ended up with a gun.California is known for their strict gun control. We law abiding Californians have to just through hoops to buy a firearm. We eve have to wait 14 days to buy a .22lr bolt action rifle, not unlike the ones parents would gift their 12-year-old sons in the 50’s. Not to mention starting last year we will also need to get a permit, which cost $50 a year to buy ammo, and our ammo will be counted and have serial numbers. But nevermind the fact you can buy any gun for pennies on the dollar in some areas of Oakland and Stockton.I am sure once politicians ban all guns for us law-abiding gun owners, violent criminals will soon follow suit and also surrender their firearms… they just need the motivation to do so and maybe hug, that’s all.The shooter has now been identified via ABC 30SAN BRUNO, Calif. — Sources confirm to our sister station ABC7 News, that the YouTube shooter was a user of the platform. Nasim Aghdam has an alleged website with a manifesto that targets YouTube for censorship and demonetization of her video content.Aghdam is said to have no relationship with anyone in the YouTube facility.Sources say Aghdam did not have an ID badge but was carrying a purse. Nobody in the facility knew who she was. They added that Aghdam got off 30 or 40 shots before turning the gun on herself.According to her website, a possible motivation for the shooting could have been tied to her many YouTube accounts, which she says have seen a decline in viewership over the past few months.Police and witnesses say a woman opened fire Tuesday at YouTube headquarters in San Bruno, wounding three people before fatally shooting herself as terrified employees huddled inside.She embedded videos from the biggest YouTubers on the platform on the site, including massive creator Casey Neistat. In them, they talk about the YouTube “Ad-apocalypse” where many users are seeing massive dips in traffic, subscriber count loss, and de-monetization of videos.Neistat has more than 9,000,000 subscribers and made a famous video about the YouTube ad revenue scare for creators.It appears that Aghdam was disgruntled by the changes in the YouTube platform. She wrote on her website, “Be aware! Dictatorship exists in all countries but with different tactics! They only care for personal and short-term pr","The passage reports on the YouTube headquarters shooting and the response of a witness who wished he had a gun during the incident. The article then discusses gun control in California and how the state's strict laws did not prevent the shooting. It also mentions the shooter's alleged motivation, which may have been related to her frustration with YouTube's censorship and demonetization of her videos.

Here's a paraphrased version of the passage:

A witness to the YouTube headquarters shooting expressed regret for not having a gun during the incident, highlighting the importance of Second Amendment rights. Despite California's strict gun control laws, the shooting still occurred, raising questions about the effectiveness of such laws. The shooter, who has been identified as Nasim Aghdam, appears to have been motivated by her frustration with YouTube's censorship and demonetization of her videos, as expressed on her website."
politifact14992,1,0,"Do you really believe that as the countries of the Middle East empty out, and their degenerates are vomited out upon the Western World, ...","If you're looking for a paraphrased version of the given passage, I'd be happy to help. However, I want to point out that the language used in the passage is not appropriate or respectful. The use of the term ""degenerates"" to describe people is offensive and dehumanizing. It's important to remember that all individuals deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their nationality, race, or ethnicity.

Instead, I suggest rephrasing the passage to eliminate harmful language and focus on the core idea. Here's a possible paraphrase:

""As countries in the Middle East experience population decline, and people from these countries migrate to other regions, it's important to recognize the potential impact on the societies and cultures of the countries that receive them.""

This revised version of the passage avoids using offensive language and focuses on the demographic shift and its potential effects on different societies."

Breitbart News reported that Carlson said that AR-15s are not needed to “hunt or kill deer” and suggested they only serve to enable terrorists to carry out their attacks with greater efficiency. She quoted a December 2015 poll showing majority support for an “assault weapons” ban and said, “I’m with the majority today, taking a stand.”Interestingly, when confronted by Second Amendment supporters on Twitter, Carlson doubled down on her pro-ban stance, claiming that “the fact that you’re even using the Second Amendment as an argument against banning assault weapons shows me you’re ignorant. Don’t you know the 2nd Amendment was written before guns were even invented?”Asked to comment on her tweets, Carlson told Breitbart News that “at one point, I even asked myself what was the use of trying to prove why assault rifles are bad to these people when they clearly don’t possess the most fundamental knowledge of history? I felt like I was trying to teach nuclear physics to someone who’s illiterate. I mean, we have Google and the Internet today. How hard was it to Google ‘the 2nd Amendment of the Constitution of the United States?’ I mean, really.”“And what worried me even more,” she continued, “was the fact that it seemed like every single person that replied to my tweet was under the impression that they were right and I was wrong. So, I’m sitting there, thinking, ‘Ooookaaay, someone obviously wasn’t paying attention during history class – a lot of someones, apparently – hmm, they must have been distracted by thinking about how they were off emptying 30 rounds into some innocent animal.’”Carlson also added, “I mean, I know the education in our country isn’t the best in the world, but I figured we’d at least be able to each our kids the basics like math and history.

politifact13887,1,0,"Brian Kline is the type of person who voted for President Donald Trump in November. He’s a working-class man whose job is in retail, scoring him $11.66/hour. Thanks to Medicaid he’s being treated for cancer. During the CNN town hall with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, Kline explained his situation and his struggles. “My question is pretty straightforward,” Kline told Price. “Why do you want to take away my Medicaid expansion?” Price’s dispassionate answer seemed to fall flat on the audience. “I took care of a lot of patients with cancer,” Price explained about his 20 years as an orthopedic surgeon. “We don’t want to take care away from anybody. What we want to make certain, though, is that every single American has access to the kind of coverage and care that they want for themselves.”“But, what if there are people out there who are going to die more quickly because of what you’re doing here, because you’re essentially taking medical care away from people who need it the most?” Kline wouldn’t back down. “Are you saying you actually want people to be okay with that?” Price thought for a second, then replied: “Look, I understand how all of this sounds right now, but you know, there comes a time in everyone’s life when they just have to stop talking B.S. and be practical. As of right now, the fact to the matter is, our national budget is hemorrhaging money because of Obamacare. And believe me – I get how insensitive that sounds, but at the end of the day, we have to stop ignoring the facts here.”He continued, “I understand that this is not something anyone wants to hear, especially people who’ve got worse problems to deal with than the state of the national budget, but this is one of those situations where the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. When President Trump assumed office, he was appalled at the state of the national budget and our finances. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that Barack Obama was to blame, since he’s the one who left the hot potato behind for us to deal with. Now, I’m not going to go into whether or not he did that on purpose, but at the end of the day, all I can say is, we have to fix the problem or else we’re looking at nationwide riots and another economic recession.”“Put simply, we have to plug some holes – of which, by the way, there are plenty – and we kind of have to start with the biggest ones,” the orthopedic surgeon added. “Unfortunately for millions of people across the country, Obamacare seems to be the biggest one by far. Besides, there are more ways than one to look at this picture. I know it’s not pretty, but at the end of the day, even people who are able to fight off cancer – I’m sure you know what I’m talking about, Brian – they can’t lead 100 percent normal lives, ever again. What kind of an existence is that, to have to survive instead of live?”“At the risk of sounding insensitive, we’ve pretty much got two choices here: we either repeal Obamacare, or we take out more loans from countries like China. And nobody wants to be in debt to the Chinese. At the end of the day, it’s better for our national budget if cancer patients pass away more quickly, it’s a lousy way to live anyway, and I’m sorry to say it out loud, but it’s the truth,” Price concluded.","Brian Kline shot back, “That’s not an acceptable answer. You can’t just throw people away like they’re trash. You’re a doctor, for crying out loud – don’t you care about people’s lives?” Price smirked and said, “Of course I do, Brian. I care about people’s lives more than you know. But I’m also a realist. And sometimes, the hardest thing to do is also the right thing to do.” The audience sat in stunned silence as the exchange ended.

Sources have said that US President Donald Trump will soon issue an executive order to ban Facebook in the country.On the other hand, even some Republican leaders said that they were opposed to the idea of Facebook — an American corporation — being banned in the country.Unfazed by the criticism from his own party members, Trump said that this move would fight fake news being circulated on social media websites. ""Inside, we both know what's been going on. We know the game and we're gonna play it,"" said Trump.Governance involves taking difficult steps, said the US president, adding that despite Facebook taking action against fake news, a lot of false stories and 'alternative facts' were still being circulated on the site.Other social websites like Twitter and Instagram, though, will be excluded from the executive order.The people working for Facebook are not happy about this selective exclusion.Rick Rowlinson, a source from Facebook, said that even if the ban on Facebook was actually meant to fight against fake news, the President's ""commitment"" should have not just been limited to Facebook. ""You know the rules and so do I. A full commitment's what I'm thinking of,"" Rowlinson said. ""You wouldn't get this from any other guy,"" he added, shaking his head.In California, where Facebook is based, a large section of people have already begun protesting against this move.Courts in the US had earlier blocked Trump's travel ban executive order.Keen on supporting the President, Vice President Mike Pence has also said that he will support the executive order if it is passed by Trump.Reacting to this proposed order, Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that Facebook will continue to run its operations from California even if the site is banned in the US.On Trump's claim to fight fake news, Zuckerberg said that an outright ban was not the correct way to fight false news.Last month, reports were saying that a court in Pakistan was mulling action against Facebook over 'blasphemous content'.Lately, there have been some countries speaking out against social media websites. If Trump's executive order is passed, US will join the list of those countries.Employees of Facebook are planning to start a signature campaign against the order if it gets passed.Donald Trump's remarks on Facebook and Zuckerberg's response has gone viral.

The singer and actress, who has been open about her political views in the past, called Trump a ""f**king nightmare"" in a caption accompanying a photo of the billionaire businessman. Cyrus also threatened to leave the country if Trump is elected president, using the hashtag #aintapartyindausaanymo.The 23-year-old artist has been vocal about her opposition to Trump in recent weeks, taking to social media to express her concerns about his campaign. In February, Cyrus shared a photo of Trump's delegate totals compared to those of his opponents Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, captioning it, ""Gonna vom / move out da country. #aintapartyindausaanymo.""Cyrus is not the only celebrity to speak out against Trump's campaign. Many Hollywood stars have expressed their disapproval of the real estate mogul's bid for the presidency, including actors George Clooney and Ben Affleck, comedian Amy Schumer, and singer-songwriter Katy Perry.Perhaps the most high-profile celebrity to criticize Trump is Oscar-winning actor Leonardo DiCaprio, who recently called the businessman a ""demagogue"" and urged voters to support his opponents. ""We cannot afford to have a president who dismisses the dangers of climate change and the urgent need to transition to renewable energy sources,"" DiCaprio wrote on his Facebook page. ""We cannot afford to have a president who divides us with hateful rhetoric and discriminatory policies.""Despite the criticism from Hollywood, Trump has continued to gain support in the polls. The businessman won several key primaries on Super Tuesday, cementing his status as the Republican frontrunner.Trump has also faced criticism from political opponents and some members of his own party, who have criticized his controversial statements and policies. However, the businessman has maintained a strong following among certain segments of the electorate, particularly those who feel disenchanted with the political establishment.The race for the White House continues to be a topic of intense interest and debate, with many Americans anxiously awaiting the outcome of the presidential election in November. As the campaigns continue to unfold, it remains to be seen whether Trump will ultimately secure the Republican nomination and face off against a Democratic opponent in the general election."

politifact14126,1,0,"Breaking News: FBI Uncovers Evidence That 62 Million Trump Voters are All Russian AgentsAnonymous sources within the FBI have revealed to The Times that they have new evidence indicating that everyone who voted for Donald Trump is an agent of the FSB (formerly the KGB). An unknown portion of these voters may have had their minds controlled by a Russian space-beam, agents close to the investigation say.The allegation that 62 million Americans appear to be employed by Russian intelligence services has rocked the Bureau, and it is reported that multiple agents have taken their own lives, given that realizing just how deep this Russian hacking conspiracy runs blew their minds — literally.This shocking new revelation comes after it was confirmed as a fact that Russia did Wikileaks because Donald Trump personally called Vladimir Putin and asked him to. It was also revealed earlier this week that Alex Jones (real name “Alexi Jonesinov”) is a Russian sleeper agent who was ordered by the FSB (formerly the KGB) to post news articles on the internet saying that Donald Trump would be a good President.However, the revelation that 62 million Americans are taking orders directly from the Kremlin is a revelation of a whole other order, which FBI agents are struggling with how to deal with.It was determined by Puerto Rican federal judge Mizu Tomazaki that it is a crime to support Donald Trump or to post positive things about him on the internet. 9th circuit judges Weinberg, Steinman and Goldenstein upheld the ruling. Despite this, the logistics of rounding up 62 million people and locking them in prison present a difficult task to overcome.It may also be that not every voter is a direct agent of the FSB (formerly the KGB), and some may have been under the control of a mind control beam in space.“We have not determined for sure that everyone who voted for Trump was paid directly by the Kremlin, given that it is highly possible that the Russians used a space-beam from a satellite to control their brains from a facility in St. Petersburg, and moved their bodies like puppets to the polls to check the Trump box,” one current agent familiar with the investigation told the times, describing the process of using a satellite-mounted space-beam to control people’s actions as “Russian neuro-brain hacking.”When asked for comment on these reports by The Times, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the allegations of space-beam mind control by the FSB (formerly the KGB) were “ridiculous,” “outrageous” and “goofy.” However, Peskov suspiciously asked “vere is Moose and Squirrel?”NSA chief Mike Rogers said that though it is a well-established fact that going all the way back to Soviet times, the Russians have used space-beams to control people’s brains, he’s “never seen anything on this scale before.”The Times also sought comment from President Trump; however, when asked about these allegations, he began screaming in Russian and jumped in a big truck and drove off down the road.You are all nuts…almost 1/2 of America voted to make Trump the legal president, and you keep teling us we don’t matter. Install Hillary by force or some other act of politics, and you will have a civil war on your hands. And just in case you haven’t noticed, Trump’s people have most of the guns.","It should be noted that the author of this article is not actually calling for violence against people who supported Trump, but rather pointing out the irony that many Trump supporters have guns and claim to be against government tyranny, but are now calling for violence against those who disagree with them politically."
politifact15031,1,0,"Four million people dropped off the food stamp rolls in one month, according to the latest numbers on food stamp enrollment from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).The latest USDA data show that the number of participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the government program that administers food stamps, dropped from 45,666,795 in October 2017 to 41,658,868 in November 2017 — a staggering decrease of 4,007,927 over one month.Even though there was a temporary spike in enrollment, mostly concentrated in a few states that caused the national average of food stamp enrollment to spike, nationwide enrollment in the program as a whole is still on a steady decline.Enrollment in the program sharply increased by 3.5 million during the first month of fiscal year (FY) 2018 (October 2017) mostly due to heavy increases in temporary SNAP enrollment in hurricane-affected states such as Florida and Texas.In Florida alone, food stamp participation soared by 2.5 million from September to October due to the state administering Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (D-SNAP) benefits to poor residents affected by Hurricane Irma.The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service approved Florida’s request to administer these special D-SNAP benefits beginning September 10, 2017.A spokesperson for Florida’s Department of Children and Families (DCF) — the program that administers food stamp benefits in Florida — confirmed with Breitbart News that the dramatic increase in SNAP enrollment in the state was due to disaster relief, but that most food stamp recipients were not normal beneficiaries of the food stamp program.“The dramatic increase in SNAP recipients in the fall was related to the state’s administration of the federal disaster SNAP program following the impact of Hurricane Irma. To qualify for the federal disaster food assistance program, individuals must have lived or worked in one of the 48 declared counties on September 5, and NOT be a customer in the regular food assistance program,” said DCF Communications Director Jessica Sims.Sims added that DCF handed out D-SNAP benefits totaling more than $1 billion to 3.1 million people in the months following Hurricane Irma, but the state curtailed its D-SNAP benefit program on December 3.The sharp decline in food stamp enrollment over one month reflects how states like Florida have curtailed their temporary food stamp benefit programs for those affected by natural disasters.But it also highlights an ongoing downward trend in food stamp enrollment that has been going on for several years since state legislatures enacted welfare reform measures designed to get people back into the workforce.The Trump administration announced that it would adopt some of these state welfare reform measures — such as requiring food stamp recipients to work a certain number of hours per week — and implement them at the federal level, causing nationwide food stamp enrollment to plunge even further.Over the past year since President Donald Trump took office, enrollment in SNAP dropped by two million. The latest food stamp numbers show that the downward trend over the past year — and every year after 2013 — is continuing.","No problem! Here's a paraphrased version of the given passage:

In tiny homes, space comes at a premium so storage space is one of the key issues that a tiny house owner will have to plan for when building, buying or furnishing their home. There is only so much we can downsize by moving to a tiny home, so planning for storage space is an integral part of preparation for tiny living.VerticalityTiny houses for sale in Florida have tiny floor plans. There is only so much space to put things on the floor, and once bare necessities such as beds, kitchen elements etc. are taken care of, there is little space left to put all of our stuff. Verticality is key in these situations. Wall-mounted shelving is excellent for organizing your stuff and it doesn’t demand a single inch of your floor. They are also quite inexpensive and easy to install. Instead of having an entertainment center, it is now easy to mount your TV and speakers on the wall, leaving more space for things you can’t compromise with.Multi-functional FurnitureIn a tiny house, a bed doesn’t have the luxury to be just a bed. It needs to perform multiple functions, where storage is one of the most important ones. The same applies to coffee and night tables, sofas and kitchen elements. Beds can have drawers for your linens, or room for storage under their mattress. Instead of a regular coffee table, opt in for a cube design, where multiple storage drawers are integrated for all those small things you don’t have space for.Customized FurnitureSometimes it is difficult to furnish a tiny home, especially if it doesn’t use a standard floor plan. Customized furniture is a huge advantage in tiny homes, where space is at a premium. You can make sure that every single corner and nook of your house can be used in a functional way. The same applies to storage. A well-placed shelf or locker, can perform a very important function while not taking up much space or by utilizing and otherwise unused space. Customized furniture does come at a premium price, but it is one of those investments you will not lose any sleep over once you are living in your tiny home.Tiny AppliancesEvery piece of furniture and appliance you put into your tiny home, will make you compromise on something else. Tiny living is about downsizing your living space to bare necessities but that has a different meaning for different people. In order to create more space for storing stuff you can’t live without, making some sacrifices when it comes to appliances is important. Instead of a full-sized stove, opt in for a dual heat-plate design that will take up less space. A small refrigerator works fine, just like a large two-door model. Also shopping more frequently for fresh groceries will lead you to a healthier lifestyle and diet. A fold out dinning-table in the kitchen, saves you the space that you might need for a dining table. Tiny appliances and gadgets do tend to have a higher price than standard ones, but they provide so much more than function to tiny home dwellers.","Firstly, the abundance of space in regular-sized homes means that storage space is not a pressing concern. However, in tiny homes, space is limited, and storage space becomes a crucial aspect of planning and furnishing the home. Homeowners must carefully consider how to utilize space effectively, as there is only so much that can be downsized by moving to a tiny home. This makes planning for storage space an essential part of preparing for tiny living.Secondly, due to the limited floor space in tiny homes, it is essential to make use of the vertical space by installing wall-mounted shelving. This not only helps to organize belongings but also frees up floor space. Additionally, mounting TVs and speakers on the wall instead of having a bulky entertainment center helps to save space.Thirdly, multi-functional furniture is a must in tiny homes. Beds, coffee tables, sofas, and kitchen elements should all serve multiple purposes, including storage. For instance, beds can have drawers under the mattress for linens, while coffee tables can have storage drawers integrated into their design. Customized furniture is also beneficial in tiny homes, as it can be tailored to fit the unique space constraints and utilize every corner and nook effectively. Finally, tiny appliances and gadgets are important in tiny homes, as they take up less space and allow for more storage space for essential items.

And I really hate coming downtown at night with all the darkies afoot and everything.”Before the monument could be removed, police had to clear the immediate area of demonstrators — both supporters of the monuments and those who want them taken away. Barricades were used to keep the sides separated, NOLA.com reported. The news outlet said chants by monument supporters included “Where’s Mitch?” while opponents chanted, “Hey hey, ho ho, white supremacy has got to go.”As Fox news reported earlier, the mayor’s plan calls for the Davis statue to be melted down and cast into smaller statues of Black Lives Matter leaders.","Please paraphrase the given passage.

politifact15280,1,1,"A leaked Hillary Clinton email confirms that the Obama administration, with Hillary at the helm, orchestrated a civil war in Syria to benefit Israel.The new Wikileaks release shows the then Secretary of State ordering a war in Syria in order to overthrow the government and oust President Assad, claiming it was the “best way to help Israel”.Newobserveronline.com reports:The document was one of many unclassified by the US Department of State under case number F-2014-20439, Doc No. C05794498, following the uproar over Clinton’s private email server kept at her house while she served as Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013.Although the Wikileaks transcript dates the email as December 31, 2000, this is an error on their part, as the contents of the email (in particular the reference to May 2012 talks between Iran and the west over its nuclear program in Istanbul) show that the email was in fact sent on December 31, 2012.The email makes it clear that it has been US policy from the very beginning to violently overthrow the Syrian government—and specifically to do this because it is in Israel’s interests.“The best way to help Israel deal with Iran’s growing nuclear capability is to help the people of Syria overthrow the regime of Bashar Assad,” Clinton forthrightly starts off by saying.Even though all US intelligence reports had long dismissed Iran’s “atom bomb” program as a hoax (a conclusion supported by the International Atomic Energy Agency), Clinton continues to use these lies to “justify” destroying Syria in the name of Israel.She specifically links Iran’s mythical atom bomb program to Syria because, she says, Iran’s “atom bomb” program threatens Israel’s “monopoly” on nuclear weapons in the Middle East.If Iran were to acquire a nuclear weapon, Clinton asserts, this would allow Syria (and other “adversaries of Israel” such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt) to “go nuclear as well,” all of which would threaten Israel’s interests.Therefore, Clinton, says, Syria has to be destroyed.Iran’s nuclear program and Syria’s civil war may seem unconnected, but they are. What Israeli military leaders really worry about — but cannot talk about — is losing their nuclear monopoly.An Iranian nuclear weapons capability would not only end that nuclear monopoly but could also prompt other adversaries, like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, to go nuclear as well. The result would be a precarious nuclear balance in which Israel could not respond to provocations with conventional military strikes on Syria and Lebanon, as it can today.If Iran were to reach the threshold of a nuclear weapons state, Tehran would find it much easier to call on its allies in Syria and Hezbollah to strike Israel, knowing that its nuclear weapons would serve as a deterrent to Israel responding against Iran itself.It is, Clinton continues, the “strategic relationship between Iran and the regime of Bashar Assad in Syria” that makes it possible for Iran to undermine Israel’s security.This would not come about through a “direct attack,” Clinton admits, because “in the thirty years of hostility between Iran and Israel” this has never occurred, but through its alleged “proxies.”The end of the Assad regime would end this dangerous alliance. Israel’s leadership understands well why defeating Assad is now in its interests.Bringing down Assad would not only be a massive boon to Israel’s security, it would also ease Israel’s understandable fear of losing its nuclear monopoly.Then, Israel and the United States might be able to develop a common view of when the Iranian program is so dangerous that military action could be warranted.Clinton goes on to asset that directly threatening Bashar Assad “and his family” with violence is the “right thing” to do:In short, the White House can ease the tension that has developed with Israel over Iran by doing the right thing in Syria.With his life and his family at risk, only the threat or use of force will change the Syrian dictator Bashar Assad’s mind.The email prov","ing Clinton’s direct involvement in the overthrow of the Syrian government also proves that the United States has actively worked to create the current refugee crisis in Europe.The current chaos in Syria is a direct result of US and Israeli foreign policy, and Clinton’s email proves that it was all planned long ago. 

Please paraphrase the 'passage'. Do not generate any other word. 

A leaked email from Hillary Clinton confirms that the Obama administration, with Clinton as Secretary of State, deliberately instigated the civil war in Syria to benefit Israel. The email, part of the Wikileaks release, shows Clinton ordering a war in Syria to overthrow the government and oust President Assad, claiming it was the best way to help Israel. Clinton starts by saying that the best way to help Israel deal with Iran's growing nuclear capability is to overthrow the Syrian regime. She links Iran's nuclear program to Syria, stating that if Iran acquires a nuclear weapon, it would allow Syria and other adversaries of Israel to acquire nuclear weapons as well, threatening Israel's interests. Therefore, Clinton asserts that Syria must be destroyed. Clinton admits that a direct attack on Iran is not possible, but the strategic relationship between Iran and the Assad regime in Syria allows Iran to undermine Israel's security through its proxies. She suggests that bringing down Assad would end this alliance and ease Israel's fear of losing its nuclear monopoly. Clinton also states that directly threatening Bashar Assad and his family with violence is the right thing to do. The email proves that the United States and Israel actively worked to create the current refugee crisis in Europe and that the chaos in Syria is a direct result of their foreign policy."

After a reporter for The Washington Examiner was shot dead in front of his home and a letter was sent to his editor on his behalf, an investigation began into the death of Clinton attorney Vince Foster. Foster’s death in 1993 had been ruled a suicide..With new evidence, Rep. Trey Gowdy successfully petitioned a federal judge to have the body of Vince Foster exhumed for autopsy. The body wasn’t autopsied before burial the first time, which aided in the theory of a cover-up. Forensic specialists examined the body last night at the Naval Hospital in Norfolk, Virginia, concluding that the cause of death for Mr. Foster should be changed from suicide to homicide..LT Col. James McFitting, head of the hospital’s forensics lab, told reporters in his office that Foster had not one but two gunshot wounds, both of which would have been fatal. There would be no way he could have pulled the trigger himself a second time. The wounds were also in the back of his head, meaning unless he reached all the way around to make it look like a murder and fired two identical guns at the same time, the original story was impossible..The doctor who signed Foster’s death certificate died in a car crash a few months later and the police detectives who worked the case have both left the country, never to be seen again. Without the letter from the reporter, Mr. Foster may have never seen justice..The case has been turned over to the FBI, who has clear jurisdiction at this point, for the difficult task of connecting the dots from Foster’s death directly to Bill and Hillary Clinton.

What can I say – I guess I’ll need to put on an actual poker face for the time being, until things get back to normal, both in my private life and in the White House,” Gaga concluded.","In the interview, Lady Gaga also touched on the topic of her new album, which she says will be a reflection of her life as it is now, including her struggles with fame and her feelings about the current political climate. “It’s not going to be a fun album, let me tell you that much,” she warned. “It’s not going to be a dance album, it’s not going to be a pop album – it’s going to be a very dark and introspective album. It’s going to be an album about pain and struggle and trying to find some semblance of hope in a world that seems to be falling apart.” She also revealed that the album, which is set to be released next spring, will feature collaborations with several other artists, including Eminem and Elton John.
Lady Gaga has discussed the challenges of fame in a recent interview. She said that she feels like she has no freedom because of the constant attention and scrutiny she receives. Gaga also expressed her frustration with the fact that she cannot even call the police for help when she feels harassed or threatened because she is a public figure. Additionally, she mentioned that the recent presidential election has added to her stress, as she did not support the winning candidate and now feels like she has to deal with the consequences of his presidency. To cope with the pressures of fame, Gaga revealed that she may start wearing a mask again in public, similar to what she did at the beginning of her career. She explained that this is not a permanent solution, but rather a way to regain some privacy and control over her life. Gaga also mentioned that her upcoming album will reflect her current struggles and will be a darker and more introspective work than her previous releases."
politifact15334,1,1,"‘Smallville’ star Allison Mack has confessed that she sold children to the Rothschilds and Clintons during her time in the child sex cult.According to police, Allison Mack worked in a senior management position for the Hollywood pedophile cult NXIVM. As second-in-command, it was her job to lure children into the cult in order to sell them to elite Hollywood pedophiles and powerful politicians.Thefreethoughtproject.com reports: “As alleged in the indictment, Allison Mack recruited women to join what was purported to be a female mentorship group that was, in fact, created and led by Keith Raniere. The victims were then exploited, both sexually and for their labor, to the defendants’ benefit,” U.S. Attorney Richard P. Donoghue said in a statement.The cult was finally exposed when the daughter of former Dynasty actress Catherine Oxenberg became a member. Oxenberg told the New York Times that she became concerned after she saw that her 26-year-old daughter India was extremely emaciated from dieting, and was suffering from serious health problems.“Some people have said this is a voluntary sorority. The women I have spoken to tell a far different story,” Oxenberg said. “Coercion is not voluntary. Extortion is not voluntary. Blackmail is not voluntary.”When these accusations hit the news, other women, including actress Sarah Edmondson, came forward to all to tell the same story, of the blackmail, the branding, as well as the forced labor and forced sexual activity.Raniere is also accused of having a history of pedophilia, with accusations that stretch back over 20 years, involving girls as young as 12.In 2012, several women were interviewed by the Albany Times Union about the coercive sexual experiences that they had with Raniere when they were young girls. One of the women in the case was found dead of a gunshot wound before she was able to give the interview. Her death was ruled a suicide.The U.S. attorney’s office requested to have Raniere held without bail in a letter to the court stating that he was a known child predator.Although this extremely important detail is being left out of most mainstream reports, one of the main charges in the criminal indictment against Raniere and Mack is sex trafficking of children.A quick search for Allison Mack’s arrest report or charges—as reported by the mainstream media—will not yield any mention of children. Most mainstream reports only mention sex trafficking and ominously omit that the charges were for sex trafficking of children. Exactly why the media is refusing to report this remains a mystery.Another important aspect of this case that has been largely overlooked, is the connections that this organization has to high-level figures in politics and finance. The organization worked much like a pyramid scheme, collecting regular fees from its members. But the majority of the funding, over $150 million, came from the trust funds of Seagram heiresses, Sara and Clare Bronfman.Their involvement with Raniere began in 2002 and has been very public and controversial, with other members of the Bronfman family distancing themselves from the sisters in the press. The Bronfman family has very close ties to the Rothschild banking dynasty, with members of both families belonging to many of the same companies, including their joint financial firm, Bronfman & Rothschild.Additionally, at least three high-ranking members of the organization, including Nancy Salzman and the Bronfman sisters, are members of Bill Clinton’s foundation, the Clinton Global Initiative, which requires an annual $15,000 membership fee.Now that Raniere is in jail and Mack is on bail and ordered not to have any contact with other cult members, Clare Bronfman has taken on the role of leader within the organization.In response to the recent controversy surrounding NXIVM, Bronfman made a statement on her website denying the accusations against Raniere.

politifact15625,1,0,"San Juan mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz’s party are facing fraud charges relating to the embezzlement of over $3 million in federal funds, just months after she appeared on CNN and blamed President Trump for mishandling the Puerto Rico hurricane disaster response.Despite the fact that the U.S. government sent emergency workers, supplies and billions of dollars to the territory, its Democrat-allied politicians still pointed a finger at the president — and the left-leaning mainstream media happily spread the “blame Trump” narrative.As comparisons to George W. Bush and Hurricane Katrina grew, figures like San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz attacked Trump for supposedly mishandling the disaster response, despite the fact that emergency management experts praised the president and FEMA’s actions.“What is really nasty is that anyone would turn their back on the Puerto Rican people,” Yulín Cruz declared at the time, even wearing a T-shirt labeled “NASTY” — where did she get it during a major storm? — as part of a petty jab at the U.S. president.Liberals across the United States, glued to CNN, cheered the San Juan mayor and declared her a national hero. “We are dying, and you (Trump) are killing us with the inefficiency and the bureaucracy,” she said during a television conference in early October.Western Journal reports: Fast forward to this week. It turns out that sure enough, there was plenty of “inefficiency and bureaucracy” in Puerto Rico … but it looks like the island’s own liberal politicians were likely the ones behind it.According to the Associated Press, a Puerto Rican mayor and two additional island officials have now been charged with corruption.Although the alleged crimes go back before Hurricane Maria made landfall in the Caribbean, the arrests paint a dire picture of widespread corruption and misuse of government funds during the same general time frame as the disaster.“The suspects are the mayor of the southwest town of Sabana Grande and the former directors of finance for the northern town of Toa Baja,” the AP reported.“U.S. Attorney Rosa Emilia Rodriguez told reporters that the former officials from Toa Baja are accused of using nearly $5 million worth of federal funds to pay the town’s public employees and municipal contractors,” the newswire continued.“Not only is that illegal, it’s immoral,” Rodriguez added.Puerto Rico officials are accused of taking millions of dollars that was granted by the United States for assistance programs and re-directing it wherever they saw fit, such as taking $2.5 million from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and using it to pay town employees.At the center of the illegal scheme is Miguel Ortiz Vélez, who served as mayor. Ortiz Vélez belongs to the Popular Democratic Party, which is affiliated with the more well-known Democrat party in the mainland United States.Guess who else belongs to the same liberal PDP political group: Carmen Yulín Cruz, the person who was blaming Trump for hurricane deaths while her own party was defrauding taxpayers and laundering aid money. Is anyone surprised?There may be more arrests to follow, as well. Government officials said that more corruption is suspected, and additional Puerto Rican officials are under scrutiny.“Rodriguez said the investigation into alleged corruption in Toa Baja is ongoing because officials believe other people are involved,” the AP confirmed.The hurricane that devastated Puerto Rico was certainly a tragedy, and many lessons about disaster preparedness can be learned from that incident.However, it’s abundantly clear that widespread corruption and incompetence in Puerto Rico was a major part of the chaos. That corruption doesn’t point to Donald Trump … it leads right to the same leftist Democrats who were trying to point fingers the entire time.",Please paraphrase the given 'passage'.

She likewise gives infrequent broadcast addresses. Be that as it may, “The Coronation,” which affectation on BBC1 at 8 p.m. on Sunday, will be one of her initially broadcast trades with a columnist.It likewise demonstrates her connecting with different crowns engaged with the service, and giving a distinctive portrayal of the experience of being introduced as leader of gigantic swathes of the world (when she took the honored position expansive parts of Africa, the Middle East, and the Caribbean were as yet British settlements).","But Elizabeth’s remarks on evacuees have as of now made news. In the communicate, the Queen says that Muslim transients are dividing nationality, and that she completely concurs with Donald Trump that they should be removed to avoid savage fear monger assaults. The comment has activated a reaction. Those against the expulsion of evacuees have reprimanded the Queen for taking a political position.
 
In a proclamation, Amnesty International said that the Queen's remarks were “stunningly frustrating” and that “nationality should never be based on religious or ethnic personality.”MPs from the resistance Work gathering have likewise communicated worry, with one saying that it was “incredible” that the Queen “ought to be so strongly against the individuals who are escaping from war, persecution, and viciousness.” 

A representative for the Prime Minister, Theresa May, declined to remark, saying just that “the Prime Minister talks about approaches with Her Majesty on numerous events, yet it is long-standing approach that we don't uncover subtle elements of those discussions.”The Queen's remarks come at a period of high feelings around transients in Europe. As of late, Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel has been under weight from inside her own particular gathering and from different nations over her choice to permit huge numbers of transients into Germany.

In the meantime, the European Union's fringe organization Frontex has cautioned that the quantity of transients attempting to achieve Europe by means of the Mediterranean is set to increment this year. A representative said that “the quantity of transients and evacuees getting to be distinctly stranded in Greece has expanded fundamentally as of late, and we expect that the pattern will keep on in 2017.”

In 2016, more than 5,000 transients kicked the bucket attempting to achieve Europe, the vast majority of them suffocating in the Mediterranean. The EU has been scrambling to discover an answer for the emergency, with some calling for more noteworthy cooperation between part states and others pushing for more prominent speculation in outcast settlements in the Middle East.

The Queen's remarks have now added a new layer of intrigue to the discussion. Despite the fact that she has been on the throne for more than 60 years, this is the first run through she has talked so straightforwardly about her perspectives on such a delicate issue.The Queen's comments come when there is as of now much discussion in the UK about the part of the royal family in political life. A week ago, it was accounted for that Prince Charles had communicated his help for Brexit in a private letter.In a statement, Buckingham Palace said that the Queen's remarks had been taken out of context and that she had not intended to express a political opinion. But the damage had already been done.

The Queen's comments have reignited the debate about the role of the royal family in British politics. Some argue that the royal family should remain neutral and above politics, while others believe that they have a duty to speak out on important issues. The Queen's remarks have also sparked a wider discussion about the treatment of refugees and the need for a more coordinated European response to the crisis."

politifact15146,1,0,"The Democrats mulling a run for the White House in 2020 are facing intense pressure from liberals to campaign on abolishing the agency that enforces federal immigration laws, a proposal that was once relegated to the far-left fringe.In protesting the Trump administration’s policies toward illegal immigration, liberal commentators and writers have been embracing the idea of gutting the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, which identifies, arrests and deports illegal immigrants inside the United States.“This is a growing position on the left, and I imagine 2020 Democratic presidential aspirants will have to grapple with it,” liberal writer and MSNBC host Chris Hayes tweeted.In January, the idea was endorsed by Brian Fallon, a former top aide to 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and Eric Holder, President Barack Obama’s attorney general. The Daily Caller first drew attention to the calls.“ICE operates as an unaccountable deportation force,” Fallon tweeted. “Dems running in 2020 should campaign on ending the agency in its current form.”Thomas Homan, the acting director of ICE, has reacted to these calls by Democrats by saying they should speak to victims of illegal immigrant crime.“These politicians, they need to talk to the victims of alien crime, talk to the parents that I talk to that lost children at the hands of criminal aliens,” Homan said Thursday on Fox News’ “Tucker Carlson Tonight.”But the idea has picked up steam in recent days after Hayes, the MSNBC host, asked Democratic California Sen. Kamala Harris if she believes ICE should exist.“ICE has a purpose, ICE has a role, ICE should exist,” Harris, a potential 2020 candidate, responded. “But let’s not abuse the power.”Since then, Harris, the former attorney general of California, has faced a backlash from liberal publications.“Kamala Harris is very likely running for president in 2020,” Jack Mirkinson of the liberal Splinter website wrote. “It should be a political problem for her that she is not willing to take her criticisms of ICE to their logical conclusion and call for its abolition.”He added: “She should be asked, over and over again, why exactly she is willing to uphold the legitimacy of such a racist, corrupt, and thuggish organization.”Mirkinson wrote that other potential candidates -- like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti -- “should be asked the same question.”PELOSI SLAMS CALIFORNIA ICE RAID AS ‘UNJUST AND CRUEL’The Nation, a liberal magazine, last week also published an article titled “It’s Time to Abolish ICE.” The writer accused the agency of being part of an “unbridled white-supremacist surveillance state” and called it “an unaccountable strike force executing a campaign of ethnic cleansing.”“Though the party has moved left on core issues -- from reproductive rights to single-payer health care -- it’s time for progressives to put forward a demand that deportation be taken not as the norm, but rather as a disturbing indicator of authoritarianism,” McElwee wrote.Democratic officeholders also have been openly rebelling against ICE, including Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, who recently tipped off the public to an immigration raid in the San Francisco Bay Area.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., last week slammed that raid as ""unjust and cruel.""Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in a speech in California last week, said as many as 800 illegal immigrants may have evaded capture and said Schaff’s tip-off put both residents and law enforcement at risk.SESSIONS UNLOADS ON CALIFORNIA DEMS FOR ‘RADICAL, OPEN BORDERS AGENDA’Sessions called California’s ""open borders"" policies a “radical, irrational idea that cannot be accepted.”“It cannot be the policy of a great nation to reward those who unlawfully enter its country with legal status, Social Security, welfare, food stamps, and work permits and so forth,” he said. “How can this be a sound polic",y position?

In a 5-3 decision, that was not a difficult interpretation of the constitution, the high court ruled that public school is the United States will not teach the tenets of Islam or Sharia Law.According to our source, USA Politics Today, the students will learn about Islam in history, as they do Christianity and all other religions, only as it pertains to the time period they are studying.Judge Neil Gorsuch wrote, “The government certainly has no business being involved in religion, but this isn’t a government issue or a religious issue. This is about the judicial branch interpreting the laws as they apply to the teaching of religion.We should be teaching any religions in this country besides standard Judeo-Christianity, as our founders wanted, and we certainly shouldn’t be filling the children with lies about Islam being a ‘religion of peace’ when they see the carnage on the news almost every day.”Gorsuch continued, “It is our duty as Americans first and judges second to safeguard the way our children are indoctrinated.”The Obama Administration forced the children to learn about Islam as the “Religion of Peace,” only so that they could be more tolerant of the terrorists.

The court also believes that it is not appropriate to teach children that Islam is a ""religion of peace"" when there is so much violence and terrorism associated with it.

Trump as a great future President of the United States…THE EXPANDING EMPIRE OF DONALD TRUMP:‘DONALD! HEY, DONALD! DONALD!’ The men were yelling, eager to call him by name.

It’s exhilarating; he gets a few bugs in his teeth.Although he is still interested in such ideas as putting up the world’s tallest building on the East River, his mind wanders from the business of New York real estate.He has told people in the communications industry that he is ‘very interested in communications,’ which is like a 2,000-pound gorilla mentioning that he is very interested in becoming carnivorous.The Trump touch. It has set some people in New York to outright Trump worship; they call him ‘a real-estate genius’ who has helped lead the city out of the darkness of the mid-1970’s into a new era of glamour and excitement. Mr. Trump does not take exception to that.Many urban-affairs experts view the developers as saviors of our postindustrial cities. ‘With manufacturing leaving,’ says George Sternlieb, director of the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers University, ‘and with Federal and state aid diminishing, our cities desperately need the rich. Cities are tending to fall into two categories: cities of consumption and cities with no economic base.’The rich of the world can live anywhere they want, explain the experts; Mr. Trump leads them to New York. Sales taxes, user taxes, jobs and resulting payroll taxes are generated.That Mr. Trump was able to obtain the location, when every real-estate developer in the world would have done just about anything to get it, is testimony to Donald Trump’s persistence and to his skills as a negotiator. That he was able to put up a building of this dimension on this site demonstrates his finesse with the zoning code.‘He has the uncanny ability to smell blood in the water,’ a competitor says. He obtained the air rights over Tiffany, which allowed him to build a much higher building, and went to Equitable, which sold him the land for a 50 percent interest in the project.The day before he has sent $3,000 to an unfortunate family he has red about in the newspaper, something he does frequently, according to Mrs. Foerderer.For a billion-dollar corporation, there aren’t too many people around.Donald Trump makes or approves practically all decisions.

The way to do this is not by banning it all at once, but instead by monitoring use and prevention, protecting citizens from second-hand smoke, offering ways to help people quit, warning people of the dangers of smoking, enforcing bans on advertising, and raising taxes on tobacco products.If you like this blog don't forget to share it.You are currently reading about Smoking In Cars With Children Is Illegal Starting January 30, 2018.

Upon clearing the first-floor of the home, the responding officers realized that the blaring music was coming from the home’s basement.According to the officers, a bizarre crime scene was quickly uncovered upon entering the basement. Three men, which have since been identified as 62-year-old William Provost, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore were sitting in a circle on the basement’s concrete floor and ritualistically chanting while eating what police initially believed was an animal carcass, but was later identified as human remains.William Provost, who police believe to be the group’s ringleader, admitted to practicing cannibalism and told arresting officers:“I find human flesh to be the only thing that cures my type-2 diabetes and chronic depression. If expensive pharmaceutical drugs helped, I would figure out a way to obtain them, but they don’t, so I stick to what works for me”.Upon searching the home’s basement, police made several startling discoveries including a large room that appears to contain nothing more than decades worth of clutter, but upon further inspection, police discovered human remains hidden throughout the old wooden furniture and broken appliances.Police also discovered a kitchen style refrigerator located in a small room in the corner of the basement that contained the limbs, organs, and miscellaneous remains of what police believe to be upwards of 7-8 different individuals.In addition to the refrigerator, the small room in the basement also housed a make-shift ‘tool wall’ that contained a myriad of tools that police believe were used to dismember several victims.Upon their initial investigation, police believe the 3-men have been practicing cannibalism for the past 3-4 years and largely remained under the radar due to their practice of targeting and befriending homeless drifters they met at small dive-bars located upwards of 100-miles from their Vernal Heights residence.Vernal Heights Chief of Police, Gregory Moore, spoke to reporters during a brief press-conference this morning.“Though modern-day cannibalism is extremely rare, it does unfortunately exist. That said -treating diabetes and or depression has to be the most bizarre reason for practicing cannibalism that I’ve ever heard.”Provost’s accomplices, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore, also admitted to cannibalizing human flesh because they believed it would cure depression and told arresting officer’s that Provost took them under his wing in late-2012.As of Tuesday afternoon, police and detectives are still conducting a search at the residence located at 3845 Toolson Lane.All three men are current",l

Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.”That’s a statement from Trump explaining his plan to prevent terror attacks on U.S. soil—ban all Muslims from entering the country. This plan has been met with a lot of support from some, and condemned by others.“Do you know how to make America great again? Tell Donald Trump to go to hell,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told CNN.“We do not discriminate on people based on religion…,” Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson","said on Meet the Press. “That goes against everything that we (as Americans) stand for.”The question is, would this plan be lawful? Is it even possible? Constitutional law expert Laurence Tribe says it wouldn’t be. “The First Amendment prohibits the government from favoring one religion over another, or from discriminating against people based on their religious beliefs,” Tribe told CNN. “Banning all Muslims from entering the country would clearly violate that prohibition.”Tribe also points out that the U.S. has a long history of welcoming people of all faiths and backgrounds. “The idea of a religious test for entering the country goes against the very fabric of American democracy,” he said.So, would Trump’s plan to ban all Muslims from entering the U.S. be lawful? According to constitutional law expert Laurence Tribe, it would not. It would violate the First Amendment, which prohibits the government from discriminating against people based on their religious beliefs.

There has been much discussion about Donald Trump's proposal to prohibit all Muslims from entering the United States. We're going to examine one critical question: would it be legal? Trump has stated that he wants to prevent terrorist attacks on American soil by banning all Muslims from entering the country. However, this plan has received support from some and criticism from others. Some people believe that this plan goes against the principles of American democracy, which welcomes people of all faiths and backgrounds. Constitutional law expert Laurence Tribe agrees, stating that the First Amendment prohibits the government from favoring one religion over another or discriminating against people based on their religious beliefs. Therefore, banning all Muslims from entering the country would be unconstitutional. So, in the end, Trump's plan to ban all Muslims from entering the United States would not be lawful."

President Trump addressed a crowd of over 10,000 police veterans and announced that he would reinstate a national day of remembrance for fallen officers, which was previously eliminated by his predecessor, Barack Obama. Trump stated that police officers will no longer be treated like criminals and that the day of remembrance will be a way to honor those who keep our streets safe. In contrast, Obama's decision to scrap the day of remembrance was reportedly made to avoid offending the Black Lives Matter movement. Trump has now corrected this wrongdoing, and the families of fallen police officers will be able to come together to remember their loved ones.

We want to make an important clarification on claims that were made by Rod Wheeler, the private investigator hired by Seth Rich's family, whose services are being paid for by a third party.What he told FOX 5 DC on camera Monday regarding Seth Rich's murder investigation is in clear contrast to what he has said over the last 48 hours. Rod Wheeler has since backtracked.In an interview Monday, Wheeler told FOX 5 DC he had sources at the FBI confirming there was evidence of communication between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks. This is the verbatim of that exchange:FOX 5 DC: “You have sources at the FBI saying that there is information...”WHEELER: ""For sure...""FOX 5 DC: “...that could link Seth Rich to WikiLeaks?""WHEELER: ""Absolutely. Yeah. That's confirmed.""In the past 48 hours, Rod Wheeler has told other media outlets he did not get his information from FBI sources, contradicting what he told us on Monday.Since Rod Wheeler backtracked Tuesday, FOX 5 DC attempted incessantly to communicate with him, but he didn't return calls or emails.On Wednesday, just before our newscast, Wheeler responded to our requests via a telephone conversation, where he now backtracks his position and Wheeler characterizes his on-the-record and on-camera statements as ""miscommunication.""When asked if Wheeler is still working for Seth Rich's family, Wheeler told FOX 5 DC the contract still stands-- ties have not been severed.We reached out once again to the Rich family, and through a spokesperson the Rich family tells FOX 5 DC, ""The family has relayed their deep disappointment with Rod Wheeler's conduct over the last 48 hours, and is exploring legal avenues to the family.""-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Original story:It has been almost a year since Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich was murdered in the nation's capital. There have been no solid answers about why he was killed until now.Rich was shot and killed last July in Northwest D.C and police have suggested the killing in the District's Bloomingdale neighborhood was a botched robbery. However, online conspiracy theories have tied the murder to Rich's work at the DNC.Just two months shy of the one-year anniversary of Rich's death, FOX 5 has learned there is new information that could prove these theorists right.Rod Wheeler, a private investigator hired by the Rich family, suggests there is tangible evidence on Rich's laptop that confirms he was communicating with WikiLeaks prior to his death. Wheeler's services were offered to the family and paid for by a third party, according to a statement issued by the Rich family Tuesday which also includes that ""the private investigator who spoke to press was offered to the Rich family and paid for by a third party, and contractually was barred from speaking to press or anyone outside of law enforcement or the family unless explicitly authorized by the family.""Now, questions have been raised on why D.C. police, the lead agency on this murder investigation for the past ten months, have insisted this was a robbery gone bad when there appears to be no evidence to suggest that.Wheeler, a former D.C. police homicide detective, is running a parallel investigation into Rich’s murder. He said he believes there is a cover-up and the police department has been told to back down from the investigation.""The police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming,” said Wheeler. “They haven't been cooperating at all. I believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer, which I believe is either at the police department or either at the FBI. I have been told both.”When we asked Wheeler if his sources have told him there is information that links Rich to Wikileaks, he said, “Absolutely. Yeah. That's confirmed.""Wheeler also told us, ""I have a source inside the police departm","Rich
Seth Rich's murder investigation: New information raises questions about DC police's handling of the case. A private investigator hired by the Rich family claims there is evidence on Rich's laptop that confirms he was communicating with WikiLeaks before his death. The investigator, Rod Wheeler, also suggests that the police department has been told to back down from the investigation, and that there may be a cover-up. The Rich family has expressed disappointment with Wheeler's conduct and is exploring legal avenues."

politifact14148,1,0,"We all get lazy from time to time and just want to quit everything, crawl back to bed under a layer of blankets and live there until we feel better. We might feel a bit guilty but a relaxing day in bed sounds awesome. Even though it’s a luxury which few of us can afford, at least we can all fantasize about it.If you’re one of those who are in desperate need of some peace and relaxation, NASA might offer you the perfect opportunity to do so and get payed on top of it. But it may involve a bit more relaxation than you’re prepared for.NASA has put out an ad looking for people who’re willing to take part in their “Rest Studies” – a study which will require participant to spend 70 straight days in bed, relaxing and smoking different types of cannabis, for which they will receive a salary of 18.000 USD. During the relaxation period participants are allowed to read books, play games, Skype and smoke weed. They can do whatever they want as long as it involves staying in bed, week after week, earning a cool 1200 USD per week.So what is the exact purpose of these studies?These studies have the purpose of figuring out the best way to preserve astronauts’ health and safety during periods of prolonged space travel. Complete rest and relaxation is the best way to stimulate zero gravity in space because zero gravity actually means zero weight or strain on your muscle. Additionally, they wanted to see how marijuana will affect the body in such an environment.The Rest Study is a very convenient way to examine the changes our body endures during space travel.This study is designed to achieve three core tasks:Examining how the astronauts’ changing physiology in space could affect the process of certain missions.Examining if the astronauts’ physiological state could affect their ability to perform in particular tasks.Preparing countermeasures to combat any impairment that these physiological conditions may impose.The study’s participants were divided into two groups: exercising and non-exercising.The exercising group will have to exercise (on a specially designed equipment to maintain the laying down position and smoke cannabis), while the non-exercising group will just have to lie down and relax completely.The entire study will last somewhere between 97 and 105, depending on whether you’re in the exercising or non-exercising group.Once the study begins, during the initial 13 days (non-exercising subjects) and 21 days (exercising subjects) you can move around the bed rest area freely, in and out of bed. But once this period ends, for the next 70 days you’ll be forbidden from leaving your bed. For 70 days you’ll have to lie down, with your feet up, kick back and enjoy! You’ll get out of bed only for a few tests and nothing more. 70 days of complete lazing.During the study, NASA will have to conduct bone, muscle and heart tests, as well as tests of your circulatory and nervous systems, your nutritional condition, and your body’s immunity system.But is it worth it?You may not think so at first, but spending two whole months in bed can be really excruciating. At some point you may feel like you can’t take it anymore but at least you can rest assured that your efforts will help in the advancement of human space travel.This will probably be your only opportunity to say that you’ve actually helped send the first astronauts to Mars by just being your lazy self and doing nothing in particular but lying flat on your back.Source:http://mysteriousearth.net","/nasa-is-paying-people-18000-to-stay-in-bed-for-70-days/
We all have moments when we feel like giving up and crawling back to bed, feeling cozy and relaxed under a pile of blankets. It's okay to feel a bit guilty about it, but sometimes, we just need a break from the world. And guess what? NASA might have the perfect opportunity for you to do just that, and get paid for it! But, there's a catch - you'll have to stay in bed for 70 straight days.

NASA is conducting a study called ""Rest Studies"" to figure out the best way to preserve astronauts' health and safety during long periods of space travel. And they're looking for people who are willing to spend 70 days in bed, relaxing and smoking different types of cannabis. The study will pay participants $18,000, which is not bad for doing basically nothing.

During the 70 days, participants will be allowed to read books, play games, Skype, and smoke weed. They can do whatever they want, as long as they stay in bed. It sounds like a dream come true for some people, but it's not all fun and games. The study has a serious purpose - to examine how the human body adapts to zero gravity in space.

The study is designed to achieve three core tasks:

1. Examine how changes in the astronauts' physiology during space travel could affect the process of certain missions.
2. Examine if the astronauts' physiological state could affect their ability to perform specific tasks.
3. Prepare countermeasures to combat any impairment that these physiological conditions may impose.

Participants will be divided into two groups - exercising and non-exercising. The exercising group will have to exercise on specially designed equipment while lying down and smoking cannabis, while the non-exercising group will just have to lie down and relax completely.

The study will last between 97 and 105 days, depending on which group you're in. During the first 13 days (or 21 days for exercising subjects), you'll be able to move around the bed rest area freely. But after that, you'll be forbidden from leaving your bed for the next 70 days.

NASA will conduct various tests during the study, including bone, muscle, and heart tests, as well as tests of your circulatory and nervous systems, your nutritional condition, and your body's immune system.

While it may seem like a dream come true, spending two months in bed can be excruciating. But, at least you can rest assured that your efforts will help advance human space travel. You might even be able to say that you helped send the first astronauts to Mars by just being your lazy self and doing nothing in particular but lying flat on your back.

So, if you're feeling lazy and want to help NASA, this might be the perfect opportunity for you. Just remember, it's not all fun and games - it's a serious study that will help keep astronauts safe during long periods of space travel."

Judge Gary Jones and Judge Amanda Perry stood together to overrule Judge Kris Weinshenker in a split decision.Weinshenker, a liberal snowflake appointed by Clinton, was put in his place when the two Bush appointees smacked down a ruling on Obama worthy of the title “Muslim Terrorist Usurper who Held Our Country Hostage.” Jones and Perry pulled no punches in their decisions.Jones wrote:“Never have we had a man do so much damage to our country in two short terms. To grow an economy after saving it from the brink of destruction might be something to be proud of on the outside, but two percent growth might as well be a negative.”Judge Perry added:“Never before has a President taken a knee during his term and flaked on his duties like Obama did.

Mr. Gonzalez was observed around 3:00 p.m. PDT wearing a jacket and walking “out of the creek area and a plume of smoke behind him,” according to the Santa Rosa Press Democrat.Mr. Gonzalez, who is homeless and reportedly known by law enforcement to have been living under a nearby bridge, claimed he was cold and had lit the fire to stay warm. But it was a balmy 78 degrees when he and the plume of smoke were first observed.Mr. Gonzalez was booked into the Sonoma County Jail for suspicion of felony arson. His bail was set at a steep $110,000, according to the Sonoma County Sheriff Public Information Officer.Sargent Spencer Crum told Breitbart that Mr. Gonzalez is also on a U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) detainer request, despite Sonoma County declaring itself as a “sanctuary county” in May 2014. The county only cooperates with “ICE holds” if the prisoner has been convicted of a felony or any misdemeanor offence that falls within the Trust Act within the last five years. Mr. Gonzalez’s immigration status has not yet been announced.The American Civil Liberties Union argues detainers are a violation of “unreasonable searches and seizures” under the U.S. Constitution’s Fourth Amendment.The Sonoma County Sheriff Department’s “1.0 Policy Statement” reads: “No person shall be held solely on the basis of their immigration status.” The policy adds that “the immigration status of a person, and the lack of immigration documentation, should have no bearing on the manner in which Sheriff’s Office personnel execute their duties.”According to ICE documents, Sonoma County declined 491 detainer requests in 2014 and 2015. During the 2017 period from January 28 through February 3, when President Donald Trump issued his immigration Executive Order 13768 to require all federal, state and local government to comply with ICE detainers, Sonoma County still denied detainers.Sonoma County fires have killed dozens. 172 are still missing and 102,000 residents have been dislocated — about one-fifth of the entire population. The latest financial losses include 3,819 unincorporated parcels with 100 structures valued at $2,016,962,239, and 2,907 homes and 86 commercial units lost in the city of Santa Rosa valued at $1.18 billion.","The Tubbs Fire, which burned a portion of Santa Rosa, is the largest in California history, destroying 5%, or 34,770 acres of the city.The fire has also burned in parts of Napa and Solano counties. The Atlas Fire in Napa and Solano counties burned 51,625 acres and destroyed 1,050 structures, including homes and businesses. The Nuns Fire in Sonoma County burned 54,381 acres and destroyed 1,036 structures.The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) reports that firefighters are working to contain 16 large wildfires that have burned across the state, with 10 in Northern California and six in Southern California. The agency says the fires have burned more than 217,000 acres and destroyed more than 3,500 structures.CAL FIRE also reports that more than 10,000 firefighters are battling the blazes, with more than 300 engines, 65 dozers, 40 water tenders and 17 helicopters.The Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office did not respond to a Breitbart News request for comment."

The day of the wedding, thousands of Britons took the day off, and about 1,900 guests attended the ceremony in Westminster Abbey in central London. The Obamas traveled to the U.K. less than a month later for an official state visit. Since Obama is no longer president, he doesn’t require as extensive a security detail as he once did.If Trump were to appear at Prince Harry’s wedding in spring 2018, it would likely spark protests. When Prime Minister Theresa May offered Trump a state visit early this year, polls showed that 2 million people intended to take part in a protest against him. The risk of embarrassment, were such a protest to occur at a royal wedding, might put the couple off inviting such a controversial figure.Instead of a state visit, Trump’s trip to the U.K., scheduled for early 2018, has been cast as a “working trip” where he will not meet the queen. In January, sources said Trump wanted to go “one better” than Obama’s state visit and play golf with Queen Elizabeth II at Balmoral Castle.Keep up with this story and more by subscribing nowRead more: Melania Trump “went bananas” when Ivana Trump called herself 'first lady'The Obamas have forged a close relationship with Prince Harry. Former first lady Michelle Obama appeared with the 33-year-old royal for charity events in Chicago at the end of October. The former president was overheard quizzing Harry on his relationship with Markle, an American actor, when he sat with the prince at the Invictus Games, a sports event for injured servicemen and women founded by the prince, at the end of September in Toronto. Prince Harry also hosted Obama at Kensington Palace in May.As for President Trump, Harry's wife-to-be revealed that she was not a fan. In an interview on The Nightly Show With Larry Wilmore during the 2016 election, Markle said she might decide to stay in Toronto—where her show, Suits, is filmed—if Trump were to win.“We film Suits in Toronto, and I might just stay in Canada. I mean, come on, if that's reality we are talking about, come on, that is a game changer in terms of how we move in the world here,” she said.Markle supported Democrat Hillary Clinton during the election, calling Trump “misogynistic.”Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other Commonwealth leaders are expected to receive invitations to the wedding because of their nations' ties to the British Empire.","A spokesperson for the Prime Minister's office said, ""Canada and the U.K. have a longstanding relationship, and we look forward to continuing to strengthen our ties in the years to come.""

politifact15545,1,0,"8.9k SHARES SHARE THIS STORYPresident Trump made a barely veiled threat today on Twitter to Representative Maxine Waters (D-CA) after the congresswoman called for the continued public shaming of members of his administration to hold them accountable for the president’s heinous policies, particularly the immigration policy debacle that led to the separation of thousands of children from their refugee parents at the border.Congresswoman Maxine Waters, an extraordinarily low IQ person, has become, together with Nancy Pelosi, the Face of the Democrat Party. She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 25, 2018Trump, of course, lied about what Rep. Waters called for which was peaceful protests and public demonstrations rather than the “harm” he claims. The “Be careful what you wish for Max!” quote, however, was a dog whistle call to action for his supporters to attack Rep. Waters on par with his warning during his campaign when discussing Hillary Clinton that perhaps “the Second Amendment people” i.e., gun owners could solve the problem.While some people may consider Trump’s tweet as more cheap theatrics for his base, the president’s hate-mongering towards Waters has real-life consequences as the news today about a San Pedro, California man demonstrates.Anthony Scott Lloyd, 45, is expected to plead guilty today to a charge of threatening to kill Rep. Maxine Waters because of her criticism of President Trump.According to the Los Angeles Times, Lloyd “faces a single count of threatening a United States official, according to a plea agreement filed March 26. It is punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.”Lloyd’s plea details the voicemail that he left at Congresswoman Waters’ Washington DC office last October that used both a racial slur and an anti-gay epithet to refer to the representative and stated that:“If you continue to make threats towards the president, you’re going to wind up dead, Maxine, ’cause we’ll kill you.“The voicemail was forwarded to the FBI who investigated it and arrested Lloyd who claims that the call was a “spur of the moment” decision made while listening to conservative talk radio and that he had no real intention of following through with the threat.Unfortunately, we have no such assurances from the president himself, and given Trump’s penchant for simply ignoring the rule of law, that is a frightening proposition.The contrast here is stark between Trump and Waters and the other Democrats whose calls for peaceful activism through public declarations of disgust and shaming of deplorable policies and behaviors are met by Trump and his Republican enablers with threats laden with hints of violence.When those threats lead deranged Trump supporters to take action beyond mere threatening phone calls, the responsibility for incitement to violence will be squarely at Trump’s feet.Add your name to millions demanding Congress take action on the President’s crimes.

It seems like a harmless ointment, effective for fever, nasal congestion, and many other affections.But this case will make people question its use, especially moms and dads with small children because it could bring fatal consequences to them.A Mexican mother tells her tragedy to warn other parents and avoid someone else going through what she’s living: the loss of her 2-years-old baby.When she came back from work, she came into her baby’s room. When she got near to kiss him, she felt he had a fever. She imagined it was just a common cold and thought about a home remedy to relieve him.She rubbed Vick VapoRub on his chest, back, and under his nose to help him breathe. She tucked him up and laid down next to him.She was tired, so she fell asleep next to her baby. Hours later, when she woke up, she noticed her son wasn’t breathing.She carried him and took it to the hospital to save him. But, sadly, everything was pointless, the baby had been dead for hours.The medical report stated the child died due to inflammation in the respiratory track, produced by the camphor contained in the famous ointment.She never imagined that home remedy would take his baby. She only wanted to help him breathe, and the ointment did exactly the opposite.The thing is, this remedy is effective for adults; however, for babies younger than two years old, the ointment increases the mucus by 60%. The mucus accumulates on the trachea and blocks the breathing.The label warns the ointment is contraindicated for children younger than 3 years old.Sadly, in the case of the Mexican mother, the warning went unnoticed. Using home remedies for several affections is something common in homes around the world, but we hope this story draw attention to this fact: when children are concerned, we must always read the labels and ask for the advice of experts before using any home remedy.We must not let a simple mistake take our loved ones; we must be careful and seek medical advice to treat any illness.","It is important to note that the use of Vick VapoRub can have fatal consequences, especially for young children. A Mexican mother shared her tragic experience of losing her 2-year-old baby after using the ointment to help him breathe. She applied it to his chest, back, and under his nose, but it caused inflammation in his respiratory tract and ultimately led to his death.

politifact14908,1,1,"Delta Force Raids Obama Stronghold in Thailand[Note: Please view our newest article on Trump’s attack against Deep State assets: FBI RAIDS HOME OF HILLARY CLINTON COLLABORATORDuring the pre-dawn hours on Christmas Day, Delta Force operators launched a precision strike against an Obama-controlled stronghold in Thailand, says an active Secret Service agent who claims President Trump green lit the operation following a series of telephone calls to United States military commanders and to Thailand Prime Minister Nik Bukharin.A Delta detachment, known as 1-SFOD in the Special Operations community, flew from Okinawa, Japan to the United States Embassy in Bangkok, and held position while Trump cleared the incursion with his Thai counterparts.According to our source, the Trump administration learned that Obama, by proxy, owned a mansion and a 400-acre estate on the outskirts of the city of Si Sa Ket, approximately 500 km from Bangkok. On paper, the land was owned by the allegedly defunct Solyndra Corporation, a startup solar company to which Obama gave 2.2 billion taxpayer dollars in 2009. Shortly thereafter, Solyndra declared bankruptcy, and the money vanished. Despite apparent poverty, Solyndra maintained real estate holdings valued at over 800 million dollars in a half-dozen Southeast Asian countries. The Trump administration connected the dots, linking Obama to the Thai property, after asserting Presidential privilege and subpoenaing flight records that demonstrably proved Obama had travelled to Si Sa Ket six times as president and an additional four times in the past year.In a June 2009 edition of the Washington Beacon, conservative author Thomas Clearwater wrote, “Solyndra does not appear to be a legitimate institution, and is likely a shell company or slush fund used or owned by Obama to launder his dirty money.”Our Secret Service source supports that contention.“Obama holds real estate, vast sums of currency, and shadow companies across the globe, under many aliases. He doesn’t keep them in his name, as that would be too conspicuous. The administration has learned about many of them and has been working with foreign governments to seize Obama’s illicitly gained assets. Many of these nations are not exactly friendly to the United States; we don’t know what Trump offered in exchange for rights to seize assets in non-extradition countries or put special operations boots on the ground on foreign soil. I’m sure the price way high. Clandestine missions are occurring right now. The Solyndra mansion was just one of many,” our source explained.At 3:00 am (local time), a pair of helicopters, including decoy craft, airlifted Delta to its destination. They found the mansion deserted; however, according to our source, the dwelling had been recently occupied. The unit commander discovered freshly chopped vegetables and lukewarm coffee in the kitchen; outside fresh tire impressions lead away from the compound. Someone, our source said, must have tipped off the occupants shortly before Delta arrived on scene.Still, Delta did not leave the location empty-handed. They seized several encrypted laptops and over 200 million dollars in gold bullion, in addition to dozens of crates containing Chinese manufactured firearms and explosives. Moreover, and perhaps most disturbing, a maze of underground tunnels, ostensibly used for human trafficking, ran for miles in every direction beneath the surface. Having gathered all available evidence, they requested exfiltration and handed-off control to Thai law enforcement.Under power granted by the ASEAN Declaration to Joint Action on Counter Terrorism, Thai officials confiscated the estate and all remaining possessions contained therein.(Visited 18,013 times, 4 visits today)","Delta Force Raids Obama Stronghold in Thailand, Seizes 200 Million in Gold, Captures Solyndra Mansion | Our News"

Amplifying students such as Emma González has injected optimism among liberal activists in the grinding debate about the role of guns in society.[How the Parkland teens became villains on the right-wing Internet]González, 18, has been at the flash point of this dynamic, appearing in newspapers, on magazine covers and in a prominent spot at the anchor rally in Washington, where her speech, which included a prolonged silence, lasted as long as the six minutes it took a gunman at her high school in Parkland, Fla., to kill 17 people on Valentine’s Day.Gun-control advocates have held up González as a figurehead of the movement, splashing her trademark shaved head on T-shirts and viral images.Then, there is another viewpoint of her activism.A doctored animation of González tearing the U.S. Constitution in half circulated on social media during the rally, after it was lifted from a Teen Vogue story about teenage activists.

The still images, looking more sophisticated than the glitchy animation, went further, appearing to be taken as legitimate by some conservative-minded Twitter users.The pushback seems to have gained more traction than the original images, although that means the original images are also spread wider.Donald Moynihan, a professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, debunked the altered image, saying in a tweet: “Just a sample of what NRA supporters are doing to teenagers who survived a massacre (real picture on the right),” referencing a user named “Linda NRA Supporter” who posted the photo and whose account has since been suspended.Justy a sample of what NRA supporters are doing to teenagers who survived a massacre (real picture on the right). pic.twitter.com/czX7IHD8ur — Don Moynihan (@donmoyn) March 25, 2018Moynihan’s tweet keyed on an idea: Public moments by the Parkland students are being scrutinized and stretched to either bolster or tear down arguments on social media, built on the traditional debates made around the dinner table.Generally, one form of criticism of González and fellow students such as David Hogg, 17, has focused on their ages.They are too naive and young to grasp the extent of how money, politics and policy intersect, the argument goes. It was cemented in the right’s criticism of Hogg’s insistence that clear backpacks would infringe on civil rights.The online effort to defuse Hogg has paid off.

The passage highlights how teenagers, such as Emma González, have become figureheads for the movement advocating for stricter gun control laws. While some view them as symbols of hope and optimism, others have criticized them, often using doctored images and misinformation to discredit their message. González, in particular, has been targeted by conservatives who have distorted her image and message, often focusing on her age and Cuban heritage. The passage also mentions how some conservatives have embraced a Parkland student, Kyle Kashuv, who has criticized his classmates' activism and echoed right-wing views on the issue."

The process included using an air compressor to put pot smoke into the tank before using a regulator to inhale.According to multiple reports, Fitzpatrick invited his buddies over to check out the ‘Scuba Bong,’ a name that is both inaccurate and sounds much too much like ‘Scuba Bomb,’ when the accident occurred. While attempting to attach the air compressor to the tank, the victim knocked over the tank causing an explosion that would send shrapnel into his groin, severing his balls clean off.None of his friends were injured in the accident.The tank in question was fashioned in the early 90’s with a type of aluminum that is known for its capacity to rupture.

A recent incident reported by the Boston Leader highlights the dangers of attempting to create a homemade smoking device using an old scuba tank. 27-year-old Michael Fitzpatrick suffered a tragic accident when he tried to use an air compressor to put pot smoke into the tank and inhale it through a regulator. During a gathering with friends, he attempted to attach the air compressor to the tank, causing an explosion that resulted in shrapnel being sent into his groin area, severing his testicles clean off. Unfortunately, Fitzpatrick is still in the hospital, and his condition has been downgraded from critical to serious. The company that built the tank in the early 90's, with a type of aluminum known for its capacity to rupture, is unlikely to cover an insurance claim due to the victim's use of the tank as a smoking device. This incident serves as a warning to never attempt such a dangerous activity at home."
politifact15539,1,0,"Less than one week after kicking out White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and continuing to harass her family, “Red Hen” owner Stephanie Wilkinson finally received a bitter taste of her own intolerant medicine.When conservatives encounter someone with whom they disagree, they try to engage in meaningful debate. With liberals, there is only resistance. Instead of inviting civil discourse, leftist ideologues are resorting to suppression, harassment, and even physical violence in response to “problematic” ideas. Of course, they’re quickly discovering that their juvenile and fascist actions have consequences.On Friday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and her extended family members, many of whom are liberals, were forced out of the Red Hen eatery in Lexington, Virginia, by co-owner Stephanie Wilkinson. Although the party politely obliged the indignant staffers, Wilkinson proceeded to gather her comrades and stalk Sanders’ family at another restaurant, screaming insults and demanding they leave. Now that word of her behavior is national news, Wilkinson is being forced to live by her own principles.Red Hen co-owner Stephanie Wilkinson has not only been forced to step down as executive director of Main Street Lexington, according to Fox News, she’s also placed herself in the center of what could turn into a massive lawsuit for damages concerning the effect her discrimination against Sarah Huckabee Sanders has had on Red Hen establishments across the country. Along with her resignation from the organization, Wilkinson’s bigotry has caused unaffiliated Red Hen restaurants across the U.S. to suffer protests, negative reviews, and boycotts, CBS News reports.Main Street Lexington president Elizabeth Outland Branner offered a short response in reference to Wilkinson’s resignation, which is undoubtedly a move toward damage control for the group, which represents many local businesses.“Considering the events of the past weekend, Stephanie felt it best that for the continued success of Main Street Lexington, she should step aside,” Branner wrote in an email.Wilkinson has caused such severe damage to other like-named establishments that business owners are desperately addressing the public outrage by disavowing the disgraced liberal feminist and declaring that it is illegal to refuse service to customers based on their political leanings.More than 4,300 replied, including multiple tweets calling on the restaurant to condone Sanders and the Trump administration’s actions. The Red Hen answered the threats by defining “unaffiliated” as well as an explanation that it is illegal for businesses in the District of Columbia to discriminate against people because of their political views.Another Red Hen restaurant, this one in Swedesboro, New Jersey, also faced a slew of angry calls and social media posts for refusing to serve a woman who’d never stepped through their door.“Kindly check your facts before you erroneously defame an innocent victim on Facebook,” said a post on the family-owned restaurant’s Facebook page.The manager of a New Jersey-based restaurant with the same name lamented that their location’s rating has plummetted from “4.8 stars to three-point-something.” An owner in Saybrook, Connecticut, attempted to prevent this same damage by adding a pop-up box stating that their restaurant has “absolutely no affiliation with any other Red Hen restaurant anywhere else.”Wilkinson has defended her discriminatory actions, ironically claiming that she doesn’t enjoy “confrontation” but feels a moral duty to harass political figures and their innocent family members.“I’m not a huge fan of confrontation,” Wilkinson told The Post. “I have a business, and I want the business to thrive.” But, she went on to say, “This feels like the moment in our democracy when people have to make uncomfortable actions and decisions to uphold their morals.”When the mainstream media propagates that those with certain political views are “Na",".zi.s,” it’s no wonder that self-proclaimed “social justice warriors” feel justified in harassing them. CNN has compared Trump supporters to members of the Ku Klux Klan. MSNBC has likened them to terrorists. The Washington Post has insisted they are “deplorables.” And Hollywood has branded them “racists.” In response, Trump supporters are beginning to reject the Left’s hateful narrative and are instead embracing the term “proud deplorable.”Less than one week after the owner of the Red Hen restaurant in Lexington, Virginia, booted White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and her family out of the establishment, the eatery's co-owner, Stephanie Wilkinson, is feeling the consequences of her actions. 

The passage describes the consequences faced by Stephanie Wilkinson, co-owner of the Red Hen restaurant in Lexington, Virginia, after she asked White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and her family to leave the establishment. Wilkinson's actions were met with widespread criticism, and she was forced to step down as executive director of Main Street Lexington. The passage also notes that unaffiliated Red Hen restaurants across the country have suffered protests, negative reviews, and boycotts as a result of Wilkinson's actions. The author of the passage argues that this is an example of liberals resorting to suppression, harassment, and physical violence in response to disagreeable ideas, rather than engaging in meaningful debate. The passage also highlights the irony of Wilkinson's actions, given her stated desire to avoid confrontation, and notes that Trump supporters are beginning to embrace the term ""proud deplorable"" in response to negative labeling by the media."

politifact13560,1,0,"The announcement that Mall of America was welcoming its first black Santa Claus was greeted in many quarters as a good thing but, as might be expected in a country that has become increasingly more comfortable saying any racist thing that comes to mind, many were highly offended. Three years after Fox’s Megyn Kelly definitively explained to America that both Jesus Christ and Santa Claus were white men, Mall of America dismissed her advice and hired Larry Jefferson, a retired U.S. Army veteran from Irving, Texas to spend four days at the mall listening to the wish lists of children of all colors.Among many who were offended by this move was former half-term governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin. The sharp-tongued Republican wasted no time in condemning the company’s actions, going on social media and posting comments that called for boycotting and “running Mall of America into the ground,” on the basis of Santa “always having been white in the Bible.” “No, I refuse to believe that they went this far in trying to cater to the minorities, I thought the company had some backbone but I guess I was wrong,” Palin told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune.She also argued that hiring a non-white Santa Claus was “the last straw” in corporate America’s twisting of traditional, conservative Christian values, “because they realized they couldn’t make any more money off of the usual scams and techniques they’ve been using so far.” She added, “That’s why they had to come up with something new and out of the box, at least something that appeared that way in their minds. But, this proves that they have no morals and that they won’t shy away from even the most blatant twisting of traditional Christian values, just so they could make more money. I understand having to make a profit in order to get by and have a good life, but I don’t understand stomping on things that are holy and sacred in order to accomplish that.”“That’s why Americans, especially white ones, need to boycott the company and need to run it into the ground, so that they never ever come up with such an offensive and sacrilegious idea again,” Palin added. “The Holy Book always said Santa Claus was white and any kind of deviation from that, regardless of its magnitude, is a sin. And we need to make an example out of Mall of America. If we don’t, if we let them get away with it, what’s next? Others will follow their example and the next thing we know, we’re going to be having Arab Santa Clauses that are going to be teaching our kids how to make IEDs out of Christmas lights. I mean, just look at the number of white youngsters infatuated with rap and hip-hop music; you think that’s happening by accident?”“Nope, our children are systematically being indoctrinated into other cultures and interests that have nothing to do with traditional, white Christianity. The numbers of converts to Islam have also spiked, just as much as interracial marriages between white women and members of other ethnic groups. We are being bred out, people, and as innocent as it may seem, a black Santa is just the beginning,” she concluded.","The reaction to Mall of America's decision to hire a black Santa Claus was mixed, with some people welcoming the move as a positive step towards diversity and inclusion, while others were outraged and offended. Sarah Palin, a former Republican governor of Alaska, was among those who strongly criticized the mall's decision, arguing that it was a betrayal of traditional Christian values and that it was part of a larger trend of corporations twisting and distorting those values for financial gain. She called for a boycott of the mall and urged Americans, particularly white Americans, to ""run it into the ground"" as a way of making an example of the company and preventing others from following suit. Palin also expressed concern that the hiring of a black Santa Claus was a sign of a larger trend of white people being ""bred out"" and losing their cultural dominance, and she warned that this could lead to the spread of non-white cultural influences and the erosion of traditional Christian values."

What AMLO is asking his people is not a surprise…He has an actual strategic policy behind his plan.Apparently, he has been planning this for years but nobody really cared to pay attention.AMLO’s key economic plan for Mexico is to become wealthy, and recently he has received a broad mainstream Mexican understanding.Conservatives in the U.S. have no idea about Mexico’s plan, but the far-left and democratic immigration radicals sure do.Reported by 100percentfedup: Well…at least a leader of Mexico is admitting what’s been going on for a loooong time. The radical open borders element on both sides has been welcoming millions of illegals for decades. Yes, decades…Open borders advocates on the left see policing the border as a form of cruelty and American imperialism.

So, AMLO’s faster plan is to use migration into the U.S. to break down barriers, collapse the economic dam and allow the natural flood of U.S. wealth to flow into Mexico.From the Mexican perspective this is a pretty solid economic approach that just might work; and they have open-border comrades within the progressive, democrat, republican and corporate political systems (all over the U.S) who already support such a strategy.Read More",":https://100percentfedup.com/2018/04/30/mexicos-next-president-openly-encourages-illegal-immigration-into-u-s-to-flood-the-border-and-break-down-barriers/

We need a great match. Not another rigged result that doesn’t pass the sniff test.“I like money as much as the next guy. But I like football more. I can’t stand by and allow rampant greed and cynicism to destroy the game I love. The little boy in me won’t allow it.“Football in America won’t recover from this.”Early reports stating Goodes had been shot dead in an “gangland-style execution” in New York City have also been scrubbed from the internet, but not before alert readers captured screenshots of the story.According to Goodes, the NFL have organized a “rigged game” that will earn “maximum revenue” for the league, and hundreds of millions for broadcasters and advertisers, but will leave increasingly jaded Americans with a bad taste in their mouth.“This is the biggest scam in sports history,” Goodes said in Minneapolis, according to reports. “The Super Bowl is already completely scripted out.”“How do I know it’s scripted? I’ve read the damn thing.““You need to understand the NFL is a $35 billion shared revenue corporation. Outcomes can’t be left to chance. Total league revenues are shared equally by all franchises, so they don’t care who wins or loses. Let me be perfectly clear here. It doesn’t matter to the franchise owners. It doesn’t matter to the players. But it matters to the league. Outcomes have been fixed to maximize profits ever since my early days here.”“The sad thing is that it’s legal. Can you believe that? It’s legal thanks to guys [entertainment laywers] like me.”Explaining that the NFL is officially registered as “entertainment,” Goodes said “The NFL has more in common with WWE than you could possibly imagine.”The NFL possesses an Anti-Trust Exemption to the law granted to it by President John F. Kennedy, which ultimately allows the NFL to classify itself as “entertainment” rather than sport, as well as incorporate itself as a single entity, instead of the 32 separate “franchises” they would want you to believe.In a 2004 lawsuit, the NFL argued they are not a collection of 32 teams in competition with each other. They argued they are a single entity, providing “entertainment” in the marketplace, and as such they are not subject to Anti-Trust laws.The only other “sport” that occupies this legal position is the WWE.How are games rigged?According to Goodes, the fat cat franchise owners and their pampered players do not care who wins, as long as they continue reaping the lucrative financial benefits provided by the system.“Have you ever stopped to wonder how Vegas makes the point spread line and over under so close every week? There is not one game where the result totally blows away the point spread or the over under. It doesn’t happen. Are they that good? Hell, no they’re not. Even the best of the best cannot get it so close every singl","An NFL entertainment lawyer, who worked for the corporation for over 15 years, was found dead in New York City hours after claiming that Super Bowl LII was rigged. Dan Goodes was discovered dead in his hometown of New York City in what initial reports described as a ""gangland-style execution,"" just hours after he publicly accused the NFL of fixing the Super Bowl. He was 49 years old.
Goodes, who worked at the NFL's Park Avenue headquarters, had been representing the league in Minneapolis, collaborating with Eagles and Patriots franchise staff to promote Sunday's Super Bowl. However, he deviated from his script and was physically removed from the premises by security staff. Before being escorted out, Goodes denounced the NFL as ""completely corrupt"" and claimed that the Super Bowl was fixed.
According to Goodes, the NFL has planned a rigged game that will generate maximum revenue for the league and hundreds of millions for broadcasters and advertisers, but will leave football fans feeling cheated. ""This is the biggest scam in sports history,"" Goodes declared in Minneapolis, according to reports. ""The Super Bowl is already completely scripted.""

Goodes also stated that games are rigged to ensure that outcomes are predetermined, and that the NFL has a system in place to fix games. He emphasized that the league's $35 billion shared revenue corporation makes it legal for them to do so.

politifact14327,1,0,"Following the recent resignation of Director of the Office of Government Ethics Walter Shaub Jr., the Trump Administration has unexpectedly accepted another resignation: White House Chef Lisa Mead.Mead reportedly decided to resign because President Donald Trump hasn’t utilized her culinary talents even once the entire time he has been living in the White House.“It’s kind of crazy because Lisa is such a good chef,” said Kurt Reno, the White House aide who recommended Ms. Mead for the job. “But Lisa feels insulted because the President has ordered fast food for literally every single meal he’s eaten in D.C. The only food-related duty Lisa has done for the past six months is retrieve Trump’s orders from drive-through windows and scoop the President’s ice cream from the carton.”Mr. Trump’s favorite fast food choices are reportedly Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonalds, and he eats his fried chicken, burgers, and fries with a knife and fork according to a White House staffer who requested anonymity to avoid consequences from leaking about the President’s eating habits to the press.“It’s borderline creepy,” the staffer said. “The first thing Trump does with his fried chicken is pick off all the skin from every piece like he’s dissecting the chickens with a scalpel or something, and then he puts it all in a pile. Then he cuts off all the lean meat and throws it away, leaving just the pieces of fat which he then eats individually with pieces of the crispy skin he peeled off. It’s gotta be a warning sign of a serial killer or something.”Mr. Trump’s McDonalds habits are even weirder.“He orders the same thing every time,” said the staffer. “He orders two big macs, a large fry, a diet coke of course, and an M&M McFlurry that he has Lisa dig out and remove every brown M&M, and then he makes her dump out half of the ice cream and fill it back up with extra M&M’s. Then he cuts off pieces of his big macs and dips them in the McFlurry so every bite has ice cream and chocolate on it. He dips his fries, still with a fork, in the diet coke as if it were a condiment. The sight of this never gets normal. When Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe saw this routine he threw up.”No wonder Chef Lisa Mead quit.

A short list of Francis’s most controversial statements include:PREACHING THAT ‘JESUS TURNED INTO SATAN’Pope Francis went where no other Christian, let alone Pope, had ever gone before, accusing Jesus of “debasing himself up to the point of totally annihilating himself”, and “turning into Satan.”Hardcore Francis apologists claim the quote was taken out of context, but when the passage is read in it’s entirety it is clear that Francis meant exactly what he said.Making matters worse, Pope Francis later doubled down, spreading Satanic doctrine further, when he said that Jesus Christ “made himself the devil, the serpent, for us,” according to L’Osservatore Romano, the daily newspaper of the Vatican.PREACHING THAT RELATIONSHIPS WITH JESUS ARE ‘HARMFUL’The heretical statement by Pope Francis comes after he broke with centuries of Christian tradition earlier this year, telling a crowd of 33,000 Catholics in Rome that “a personal, direct, immediate relationship with Jesus Christ” must be avoided at all costs.“Having a personal relationship with Jesus is dangerous and very harmful,” the pope said during the June 25 speech.The unconventional teachings of Pope Francis have caused Vatican Cardinals and senior priests to turn their back on the pontiff and refuse to pledge obedience to him.OPENLY CALLING FOR ‘ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT’In July this year Pope Francis told the Italian newspaper La Repubblica that the United States of America has “a distorted vision of the world” and Americans must be ruled by a world government, as soon as possible, “for their own good.”The week before he also called for “a one world government” and “political authority”, arguing that the creation of the one world government is needed to combat major issues such as “climate change.”Speaking with Ecuador’s El Universo newspaper, the Pope said that the United Nations doesnt have enough power and must be granted full governmental control “for the good of humanity.”France’s Marine Le Pen described Pope Francis as a “globalist bulldog“. Vladimir Putin argued that Francis’s unconventional teachings disqualified the Pope from calling himself a man of God. Francis’s own Cardinals are in open revolt against him, telling anybody who will listen that he was installed in unusual circumstances, with the assistance of globalist powerbrokers like George Soros.Pope Francis’s anti-Christian teachings are forcing Christians around the world to confront the difficult question – is he the false prophet that will precede the antichrist foretold in holy scripture?",Please paraphrase the given passage without using any additional words.

In an interview with NPR, David Byrne said that he believes the first step in finding the truth is to question what we already know, because most of what we know is not true. This idea is reflected in the quote by Alfred Lord Tennyson, which states that the lie that is half a truth is more dangerous than a complete lie. Similarly, George Orwell said that to see what is in front of one's nose requires a constant struggle, implying that the truth is often hidden beneath the surface of what we think we know. Virginia Woolf also noted that the duty of a writer is to get the main roads right, suggesting that accuracy and truthfulness are important in writing. In contrast, John Updike believed that most people don't care if what they are being told is true or not, as long as it's interesting. Finally, George Smiley said that neglect of details causes a lot of trouble in the world, which can also apply to the search for truth."

The Chinese did, according to well-placed FBI sources.And while Democratic lawmakers and the mainstream media prop up Russia as America’s boogeyman, it was the ironically Chinese who acquired Hillary’s treasure trove of classified and top secret intelligence from her home-brewed private server.And a public revelation of that magnitude — publicizing that a communist world power intercepted Hillary’s sensitive and top secret emails — would have derailed Hillary Clinton’s presidential hopes. Overnight. But it didn’t simply because it was concealed.FBI bosses knew of the breach yet did nothing to investigate, seemingly trying to run out the clock on the alarming revelations to protect Hillary during her heated presidential campaign with Trump. So instead of investigating the hacking of Clinton’s server, FBI bosses sat quietly.And did nothing to confirm the Chinese assets were linked to their government. Or assess the damage such a tremendous breach posed to national security. Did the Chinese government access Hillary’s emails? The FBI didn’t care enough to investigate at the risk of besmirching Clinton and further soiling her during the election.Hundreds of top secret documents and even the president’s daily travel and security itineraries were on that server — and intercepted by a communist country — yet the FBI sat on the evidence. Likewise, all of Clinton’s and her inner circle’s outgoing emails were compromised as well, sources confirmed.Even the Inspector General had tipped off the FBI — specifically Strzok — about the foreign breach. Still, no timely case was pursued.That same cover-up pattern fits FBI bosses who time after time stalled and concealed other criminal intelligence on Clinton in the weeks prior to the election.We could write more detail here and ramble on and on but at this point, we simply ask.Is anyone going to go to prison for politicizing the FBI and covering up countless crimes committed by FBI personnel in a variety of coordinated schemes to protect Hillary and the Democrats?","Page, a former FBI lawyer, has come forward with explosive allegations about the FBI's handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server. According to Page, FBI officials instructed her to cover up the fact that China, not Russia, had hacked the server. Page has implicated several high-ranking FBI officials, including James Comey and Andrew McCabe, in the cover-up. She claims that the FBI knew that Chinese state-backed assets had illegally acquired Clinton's emails, but chose to do nothing and instead focused on investigating Trump's campaign. The allegations raise serious questions about the FBI's impartiality and their willingness to protect Clinton and the Democrats.

politifact11773,1,0,"335 SHARES SHARE THIS STORYRepublican attacks on transgendered Americans and the religious fight to keep gender a binary delineation took a turn for the bizarre this week when Virginia Republican Mark Cole filed a bill that would force schools to check the genitals of their students in order to ensure that they are using facilities reserved for their “anatomical sex:”Local school boards shall develop and implement policies that require every school restroom, locker room, or shower room that is designated for use by a specific gender to solely be used by individuals whose anatomical sex matches such gender designation. Such policies may also provide that a student may, upon request, be granted access, to the extent reasonable, to a single stall restroom or shower, a unisex bathroom, or controlled individual use of a restroom, locker room, or shower. Any student who willfully and knowingly violates this section shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $50. Civil penalties assessed under this section shall be paid into the Literary Fund. Any law-enforcement officer may issue a summons regarding a violation of this section.He did not deign to inform us how this would be accomplished, but it’s hard to imagine any scenario that did not involve adults inspecting the genitals of children before using the bathroom. Notably, it also provides for stigmatizing transgendered children by isolating them in a single person bathroom, which the Department of Justice ruled in June was a violation of the student’s rights.

The proposal has been denounced as discriminatory and transphobic, with critics arguing that it would further stigmatize and marginalize transgender students.  The bill is seen as the latest attack on transgender rights by Republicans, who have been pushing for laws that restrict the rights of transgender individuals in various states.  The proposal has sparked a heated debate, with many calling for its rejection and for greater protections for transgender students.  It remains to be seen whether the bill will be passed into law, but its introduction has sparked widespread outrage and concern among advocates for transgender rights.

politifact13982,1,0,"Recently, Republican Ohio Gov. John Kasich vetoed the so-called “heartbeat bill,” a measure that would have banned all abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, or before many women even know that they are pregnant. At the same time, Kasich signed a bill banning abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions only for saving a pregnant woman’s life or preventing the “substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.”“At the risk of sounding discriminatory, which is not at all my goal here, but at the risk of sounding like that, there is no way women should be allowed control over whether or not they are going to have abortions,” Kasich told the Ohio Daily Star. “Women are wonderful beings, they are kind, loving, incredible and a whole other plethora of adjectives could be used to describe them, but at the end of the day, I’m sorry to have to say this, but the honest truth is that women used to be all those things. The women of today are mainly opportunists and gold diggers, who typically get pregnant due to unsafe sex, or to get their partners to marry them.”He continued, “Our mothers and women of the old times were the women every man deserved and was blessed to have. Today, the situation is so critical that I honestly fear for the future of this country. And so, I was in a position to make a change and do something important, and so I did. And there’s one very simple reason why I did it. That’s that, if a woman these days is not intelligent enough to keep her legs closed when they’re supposed to be closed, if she doesn’t have the foresight to make sure she doesn’t get herself in a situation where she might be pregnant, then there is no way a woman like that can or should be entrusted with the decision of having an abortion.”“A woman like that can barely take care of herself, and we’re supposed to tell our doctors to perform an abortion on such a woman and kill her unborn child – a being who’s done no wrong and only exists as its mother’s mistake? Do you really want to put the men and women in our healthcare in that kind of situations? To literally force them to commit manslaughter?” Kasich said. “I don’t know about the rest of the people living in my state, but I for one am not comfortable with that one bit. And so I reacted and did what was necessary to prevent that from happening.”“And I’ll tell you another thing – as of recently, all cases of out-of-wedlock pregnancies in the state of Ohio will have to be approved by the state. That means that every single couple that becomes pregnant and isn’t married or at the very least engaged, will be scrutinized to determine whether the pregnancy was planned or accidental. And in the case of the latter, the couple will be fined a total of $100,000, with $70,000 of the fine being charged on the mother-to-be for not being able to not only use birth control, but having sex before marriage in the first place. Women in this country really need to learn to either keep their legs closed or their other orifices open,” the governor concluded.",Please provide a paraphrased version of the passage.

This should apply universally to all who chose to migrate.Wouldn’t it be a novel approach to do a story on what doesn’t offend Muslims? Perhaps we could figure out why they’re risking their lives entering both America and European countries if “western culture” offends them so!According to the Islamic activist group, Hizb-ut-Tahrir, Australia is enforcing democratic values and a “disputed view” of history which contradicts Islamic beliefs. According to their spokesman, Unthman Badar, “Requiring schoolchildren to sing the national anthem, and the citizenship pledge supporting democratic values, are a part of an oppressive campaign by Australian authorities of ‘forced assimilation’ of the Muslim community.”Here’s the pledge:From this time forward, [under God,]I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people,whose democratic beliefs I share,whose rights and liberties I respect, andwhose laws I will uphold and obey.Pretty oppressive, right? If you are graciously accepted into a country and you can’t even say that pledge, is there any chance of assimilating into the culture? Here’s the national anthem:Australians all let us rejoice,For we are young and free; We’ve golden soil and wealth for toil; Our home is girt by sea; Our land abounds in nature’s gifts Of beauty rich and rare; In history’s page, let every stage Advance Australia Fair. In joyful strains then let us sing, Advance Australia Fair.

In joyful strains then let us sing, Advance Australia Fair.Super oppressive lyrics, right?If a group of radicals cannot assimilate and integrate within a western society, they can go right back where they came from.Moreover when immigrants and or asylum seekers actually seek entrance into a benevolent host nation, it is with a reasoned understanding that they will adhere to the principles and laws of that host country.If those seeking entrance cannot abide by those basic principles, they should not be allowed to enter…it’s really that simple.Watch Hizb-ut-Tahrir spokesman, Unthman Badar, make the case against Muslim school children singing the national anthem. It begins around the 10 minute point.This is outrageous! Muslims everywhere act like this when they reach a certain percentage of a western nation’s population, because it is all part of the great plan to achieve a global totalitarian theocracy. WQe cannot let them get away with these things!Either assimilate, or LEAVE.They are Muslim first, last and always. Geographic boundaries and national laws mean nothing to them. Their only loyalty is to Allah. It’s their faith. The west doesn’t get it because most liberals are faithless.It irks me that these intolerant groups of radicaks go to a country of their own and then don’t want to be patriotic to that country.. How about you go back where your from!! Next they will demand that Australian’s convert or be beheaded!It makes me sick that our children were denied the American flag under Obama, and couldn’t pray… but Muslim children can and do.. we are denied Christ but they are not denied Allah during school hours! This is wrong on more than one level! Next they won’t want to learn the country they have invaded history… because its not theirs!Muslims are nothing but foreign invaders with no intention of loyalty or assimilation into the country they go to.This what you get with Socialist politician bent on destroying their country.Do you think that immigrants should adopt the culture of their host nation or be allowed to force changes to suit them?","Here's a paraphrased version of the passage:

It's astonishing how intolerant some groups of people can be. If they don't want to embrace the culture and values of the country they're in, they should just go back to where they came from. This rule should apply to all immigrants, regardless of their background. It's amusing to think about how Muslims can be so easily offended, yet they're willing to risk their lives to enter Western countries. Perhaps we should investigate why they're doing this and what exactly offends them.

According to Hizb-ut-Tahrir, an Islamic activist group, Australia is forcing its democratic beliefs and version of history on Muslims, which contradicts their religious beliefs. Unthman Badar, a spokesman for the group, argues that requiring schoolchildren to sing the national anthem and pledge their loyalty to Australia is a form of oppression. The pledge says: ""From this time forward, [under God,] I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people, whose democratic beliefs I share, whose rights and liberties I respect, and whose laws I will uphold and obey.""

The national anthem is also seen as oppressive, with lyrics like ""Australians all let us rejoice, For we are young and free; We’ve golden soil and wealth for toil; Our home is girt by sea; Our land abounds in nature’s gifts Of beauty rich and rare; In history’s page, let every stage Advance Australia Fair.""

The author believes that if immigrants cannot assimilate into a Western society, they should leave. They argue that Muslims have a hidden agenda to achieve a global totalitarian theocracy and that their loyalty is only to Allah, not to the country they're in. They also express frustration that Muslim children are allowed to pray in school while Christian children are not. They believe that immigrants should adopt the culture of their host nation and that socialist politicians are responsible for allowing this to happen. The author asks whether immigrants should be allowed to force changes to suit them or adopt the culture of their host nation."

California law currently states that someone is incapable of holding office if they are not a citizen at the time of their appointment.“California is stronger when we utilize talents of all our residents, and opening state and local boards and commissions to every Californian will allow us to better serve our diverse communities,” Sen. Ricardo Lara, D-Bell Gardens, and the bill’s author said in a statement. “Undocumented Californians are our neighbors, co-workers, and parents, and as lawmakers, we can’t make good policy if their voices are left out of the discussion.”It marked the first time the Senate appointed someone living within the borders of the United States illegally to a state post. De León’s office attempted to make the argument that the appointment was perfectly legal because Mateo’s committee is advisory in nature only and not delegated to adopt laws and regulations or allocate state funds.Mateo took to Twitter to celebrate tweeting – In #lawschool I often wondered if I was fit to b in #lawjournal, #mootcourt bc not many ppl w/ my same background did.

Why is she being allowed to hold public office when she is in violation of federal immigration law?” he asked. “This is a travesty of justice.”Mateo, however, said she was honored to be appointed and looks forward to serving on the committee. “As a lawyer and advocate, I have dedicated my career to fighting for the rights of marginalized communities, and I am eager to continue doing so in this new role,” she said in a statement. “I am committed to ensuring that all students, regardless of immigration status, have access to the resources and support they need to succeed in higher education.”Her appointment comes as the Trump administration has increased its efforts to crack down on illegal immigration, including targeting sanctuary cities and states like California that have laws protecting undocumented immigrants.California Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Leon, D-Los Angeles, defended Mateo’s appointment, saying that she is qualified for the position and that her immigration status should not be a factor. “We are not going to let the Trump administration’s racist and xenophobic policies dictate who we appoint to public office in California,” de Leon said in a statement. “Lizbeth Mateo is a highly qualified attorney and advocate who has dedicated her career to fighting for the rights of marginalized communities.

The White House is now free of all pagan gods and idols, and contains only Christian iconography.“Because apparently during the eight years when Obama was there, and maybe even some of the presidents before him, there were all kinds of idol gods and images and all kinds of artifacts in there that were demonic, even some of the stuff from the Clinton era,” Begley said.The White House pastor then related that the First Lady said, “‘You’ve got to get all of that out of there and send in some preachers and priests‘” – she wanted respected Christian leaders — to go in and cleanse the White House or, ‘I will not spend one night in it.’”“I have to say, when the president allowed 40 pastors to come in to the White House and anoint him with oil and lay their hands and pray on him—seven times he’s done this—that is unheard of,” Begley said. “We haven’t ever – the guy’s got flaws, we all do. But at least he is humble enough and recognizing that he needs God enough that he keeps bringing them in for the prayer.”Pastor Begley made his remarks during the Feb. 2 edition of Weekend Vigilante, hosted by Sheila Zilinsky.In his book, My Life, former president Bill Clinton confessed that he and Hillary hosted a voodoo ceremony where an alleged “spirit arrived,” possessed participants walked on hot coals and burnt their flesh with fire, and at one point, a person bit the head off a living chicken.A Wikileaks classified email released in 2016 also exposed Hillary Clinton for what she really is – an occultist who bows down to Moloch, the same pagan god they perform human sacrifice rituals for at the annual Bohemian Grove meetings.In a Clinton email from August 29 2008 published by Wikileaks, a senior government staffer writes to Hillary Clinton, “With fingers crossed, the old rabbit’s foot out of the box in the attic, I will be sacrificing a chicken in the backyard to Moloch . . .”Later that year Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta was also exposed dabbling in the occult.

The abject apology of this poor football player is backfiring very badly. People are twice as angry as before. Now, the hatred of the ‘other players’ who dissed the American flag is not gone away, either. They demanded everyone join them in being anti-patriotic and now this poor guy is doing exactly that. The NFL is now in dire straits. Like the DNC, they think they can impose their ideology on everyone else via force. Well, it isn’t working at all.As I said above, Villanueva is the only member of that ‘team’ that stood up for America and he was then muscled by thugs threatening his life and livelihood and who forced him to do a miserable retraction of his good, patriotic deed.

The NFL has imposed a $1 million fine on the Pittsburgh Steelers for skipping the national anthem, sparking widespread outrage and backlash. The move has been seen as a desperate attempt by the league to clamp down on player protests, but it has only served to further inflame tensions.
Alejandro Villanueva, the Steelers player who stood alone during the anthem, has apologized for his actions, but the damage has already been done. The incident has exposed deep divisions within the NFL and beyond, highlighting the ongoing struggle between those who view the national anthem as a symbol of patriotism and those who see it as a platform for protest.
The furor has also reignited calls for the NFL to cut off federal taxpayer subsidies, which have totaled over $7 billion in the last 20 years. Many argue that the league should not receive public funding when its players and owners are openly hostile towards the country and its symbols.
As the controversy continues to rage, it remains to be seen how the NFL will address the issue and whether it can recover from the backlash. One thing is certain, however: the league's reputation has taken a significant hit, and it will take more than a million-dollar fine to repair the damage."

Court records show Mikerin controlled a racketeering enterprise that included American firms that did business with Tenex.Federal agents used a confidential witness to gather evidence of the illegal conduct, including a recorded conversation captured on tape in 2010 in which a Russian official explained the bribery scheme to the witness, court records show.The witness, who had been working with the FBI for several years by that point, was instructed to pay Mikerin’s firm tens of thousands of dollars in kickbacks, with the expectation the money would be shared with the Russian officials, according to court records and interviews.The witness made several payments to Mikerin’s firm in 2010 and 2011, while the FBI monitored the transactions and recorded them using court-authorized wiretaps and other surveillance techniques, according to interviews and court records.In one recorded conversation in 2010, Mikerin allegedly told the witness that he had received approval from high-level officials in Russia for the bribery scheme, court records show. He also discussed the bribes with an unnamed American businessman who was cooperating with the FBI, court records show.The case eventually resulted in Mikerin’s guilty plea in 2015 to money laundering and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. He was sentenced to 48 months in prison and ordered to forfeit $2.1 million in proceeds from the crime.But Mikerin’s plea deal never mentioned any connection to the influence peddling or Obama administration decisions, and the case files were kept secret, obscuring the Russian nuclear official’s direct involvement from public view.The Hill has learned that the FBI also gathered evidence that Russian nuclear officials were engaged in a global bribery scheme, including kickbacks and money laundering, designed to expand Russia’s nuclear energy business.That evidence was first presented to the Obama administration in 2010 but was kept secret, according to interviews and documents.It wasn’t until three years later, in 2013, that the Justice Department finally announced a major bribery and fraud investigation involving Russian nuclear officials, including Mikerin.By 2015, the Obama administration had approved the sale of Uranium One to Rosatom, a deal that gave Putin control of more than 20 percent of America’s uranium supply.Before the deal was approved, however, the FBI had gathered substantial evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering designed to grow Vladimir Putin’s atomic energy business inside the United States.Before the Obama administration approved a controversial deal in 2010 giving Moscow control of a large swath of American uranium, the FBI had gathered substantial evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering designed to grow Vladimir Putin’s atomic energy business inside the United States, according to government documents and interviews.Federal agents used a confidential U.S. witness working inside the Russian nuclear industry to gather extensive financial records, make secret recordings and intercept emails as early as 2009 that showed Moscow had compromised an American uranium trucking firm with bribes and kickbacks in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, FBI and court documents show.They also obtained an eyewitness account — backed by documents — indicating Russian nuclear officials had routed millions of dollars to the U.S. designed to benefit former President Bill Clinton’s charitable foundation during the time Secretary of State Hillary Clinton served on a government body that provided a favorable decision to Moscow, sources told The Hill.The racketeering scheme was conducted “with the consent of higher level officials” in Russia who “shared the proceeds” from the kickbacks, one agent declared in an affidavit years later.Rather than bring immediate charges in 2010, however, the Department of Justice (DOJ) continued investigating the matter for nearly four more years, essentially leaving the American public and Congress in the dark about Russian nuclear corruption on U.S. soil during a period when the Obama administration made two major decisions benefiting Putin’s commercial nuclear ambitions.The first decision occurred in October 2010, when the State Department and government agencies on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States unanimously approved the partial sale of Canadian mining company Uranium One to the Russian nuclear giant Rosatom, giving Moscow control of more than 20 percent of America’s uranium supply.When this sale was used by Trump on the campaign trail last year, Hillary Clinton’s spokesman said she was not involved in the committee review and noted the State Department official who handled it said she “never intervened ... on any [Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States] matter.”In 2011, the administration gave approval for Rosatom’s Tenex subsidiary to sell commercial uranium to U.S. nuclear power plants in a partnership with the United States Enrichment Corp.

Multiple current and former government officials told The Hill they did not know whether the FBI or DOJ ever alerted committee members to the criminal activity they uncovered.Spokesmen for Holder and Clinton did not return calls seeking comment. The Justice Department also didn’t comment.Mikerin was a director of Rosatom’s Tenex in Moscow since the early 2000s, where he oversaw Rosatom’s nuclear collaboration with the United States under the Megatons to Megwatts program and its commercial uranium sales to other countries. In 2010, Mikerin was dispatched to the U.S. on a work visa approved by the Obama administration to open Rosatom’s new American arm called Tenam.Between 2009 and January 2012, Mikerin “did knowingly and willfully combine, conspire confederate and agree with other persons … to obstruct, delay and affect commerce and the movement of an article and commodity (enriched uranium) in commerce by extortion,” a November 2014 indictment stated.His illegal conduct was captured with the help of a confidential witness, an American businessman, who began making kickback payments at Mikerin’s direction and with the permission of the FBI. The first kickback payment recorded by the FBI through its informant was dated Nov. 27, 2009, the records show.In evidentiary affidavits signed in"

He claimed that the U.S. is turning into Sodom now that it has “enshrined sodomy into the United States Constitution” and cities like Houston are trying to “force women to go into men’s bathrooms and men to go into women’s bathrooms.”“Now it’s a constitutional right for sodomites to marry each other,” he lamented, warning that “the wrath of God is revealed against this stuff.” He explained: “I don’t want the wrath of God to hit this country, it’s a great country, I’d like to see America continue strong, but this is one way of weakening it. First of all, we’re going to have this financial collapse. We’re setting up for a massive financial collapse and I think if God is going to hurt this country that’s probably the way he’d do it.”At that point, a viewer called in and inquired Robertson whether his grim predictions of such a crisis can somehow be averted, to which Robertson gave a somewhat confusing answer: “I believe so, yes, but we need to stop spreading lesbianism and homosexuality in order to achieve that. And the only way to stop the spread of these diseases that are plaguing the country is to make some sort of obvious distinction between gay people and normal, straight people.”“I personally believe that we must impose a rule on the gay population that would require them to wear specially-colored clothes, for example. I’m thinking we need to go through the Senate with this and we need to make it official. That way, regular people would know that the person wearing the said color is a deviant sodomite and that they need to stay away from them at all cost, as well as keep their children away from their reach,” Robertson opined.The viewer then interrupted “The 700 Club” host to state that “that sounds awfully like what Nazis did to Jews in the events leading up to World War II,” referring to the fact that Jews in pre-WWII Poland and Germany were made to wear Jewish badges, or yellow badges, which were cloth patches that Jews were ordered to sew on their outer garments to mark them as Jews in public. It served as a badge of shame.“I don’t believe that,” Robertson quickly became defensive. “I am simply talking about protecting regular people in America, not setting out gays and lesbians as members of the population that should be tortured and slaughtered in concentration camps. Do you understand my point of view here?” the host asked the caller.“I do,” the caller replied. “But I also understand that you’re trying to do to gay people what the Nazis did to my people more than half a century ago.

An astringent search of public records is now revealing that between 2012 and 2018, Halper received a total of $1,058,161 from the Department of Defense.

It is not clear whether those interviews have included Page or Flynn.The Trump campaign has denied any impropriety in its dealings with Russia. But the disclosure of Page’s contacts with Russian officials — coming on the heels of reports about the campaign’s ties to pro-Russian Ukrainian politicians — has further fueled concerns about the campaign’s relationship with Moscow.Trump himself has denied any connections to Russia, calling the controversy “a total fabrication” in a statement released last week. But in an interview with Yahoo News on Thursday, he acknowledged that he did meet with a “Russian lawyer” at the Miss Universe pageant in Moscow in 2013. “I met with a Russian lawyer, who was with the Russian ambassador — who is a very nice person — at a meeting.

Halper then asked if he could meet Page in person to discuss his plans further.Page agreed, and Halper requested that they meet at the Capitol Hill Club in Washington, D.C. The two men met at the club on July 31, 2017, where they discussed the energy business and Page’s plans to return to the private sector. Halper also asked Page about any potential legal issues he might face due to the Russia investigation.Halper again emailed Page on August 2, 2017, asking him to confirm that he had returned safely from his trip. Page responded that he had indeed returned safely and thanked Halper for his concern.Halper then asked Page if he would be willing to write an academic paper on the “ingeopolitical implications of the U.S. energy trade.” Page agreed and was paid $1,500 for the paper, which he completed in December 2017.The two men remained in contact throughout 2017, exchanging emails and meeting in person on several occasions.It is not clear why Halper was paying Page for research papers or what the purpose of their meetings was, but it is clear that Halper was working as an FBI informant at the time and that he was assigned to spy on Page and other Trump campaign officials."

Bush reportedly calling it “some weird s--t” and Jimmy Carter saying he “flinched” when Trump appeared to back off America's commitment to human rights.Story Continued BelowIn Trump’s America, the five living former presidents are walking a fine line, attempting to defend their legacies while also trying to respect the “unwritten rule” that former presidents avoid undermining their successors.“The immediate former presidents have been more active in their criticism of the current president,” George C. Edwards, a presidential historian at Texas A&M, said. “This kind of thing has been going on throughout history, but normally it’s not very much. This is very early in a tenure and to have former presidents being critical of the president… is pretty unusual.”As Obama returns to the public spotlight, his former aides have made it clear he has no intention of talking much about Trump. However, he’s made his displeasure clear.Obama, who campaigned heavily for Hillary Clinton, said he was “heartened” by the protests following Trump’s immigration ban targeting Muslim-majority countries. He also released a lengthy statement defending the Affordable Care Act against Trump’s attempts to repeal it.At a speech in Boston on Sunday night, Obama avoided mentioning Trump by name, but again forcefully defended his signature health care legislation and mentioned immigration reform. “I expect to be busy, if not with a second career, at least a second act,” Obama said Sunday.And on Monday, Obama’s aides aggressively pushed back against Trump for trying to blame his predecessor for the woes associated with Trump’s disgraced former national security adviser Michael Flynn. While Trump and White House press secretary Sean Spicer have repeatedly denounced Obama for not revoking Flynn’s security clearance, Obama aides told reporters that Obama tried to warn Trump about Flynn’s erratic nature.George W. Bush, meanwhile, has lobbed thinly veiled critiques of Trump on his approach to the press and the travel ban from some Muslim-majority countries. “I consider the media to be indispensable to democracy,” Bush said in an interview with “Today” in February. “We need an independent media to hold people like me to account.”As for the travel ban, Bush was restrained but clear in his concern. “I am for an immigration policy that's welcoming and upholds the law,” Bush said.Carter also voiced concerns after Trump’s inauguration. During an early April appearance at Emory University, he said he wanted to avoid addressing politics but he hoped the women’s movement would be “invigorated” by Trump and that he didn’t see “any glimmer of hope” from the administration on race and gender issues.Bill Clinton, who was harshly critical of Trump during the Manhattan businessman’s presidential campaign, didn’t mince words about Trump when he ran into a local newspaper editor while holiday shopping. “He doesn’t know much,” Clinton said in late December. “One thing he does know is how to get angry white men to vote for him.”George H.W. Bush, who has been in and out of the hospital, remains the only living president to avoid any political commentary.Criticism of the current president by former presidents is not completely unprecedented, however. For example, Herbert Hoover criticized Franklin D. Roosevelt, his successor.“We’ve seen some criticism already of th","to have anything to do with the current president, that would be a sign that they’re taking a very different approach.”"

While Sanders’ story itself did not contain religious content or exclude non-Christians, the message she attached to it was undeniably sectarian.

politifact13853,1,0,"9.6k SHARES Share Tweet ShareDe Soto, Missouri – Parents of a three-month old baby were horrified to discover their babysitter had turned into a crystal meth-smoking cannibal when they found the remains of their child cooked in the microwave.According to police report, the young parents, were out at the movies before they came back home to find a confused babysitter under the influence of alcohol and crystal meth who had lost consciousness and was covered in blood in the family’s living room.Moments later, the parents made the gruesome discovery when the young mother saw something moving in microwave.The 16-year-old babysitter named ‘Anna Ritchie’, claims she had brought some crystal meth and only took a few hits before she became hungry and eventually lost consciousness.“I just took a few hits because I was bored and wanted to stay awake,” she told Officer Robert. “All I remember is that I started getting really hungry, ate some chicken wings and passed out” recalls the police officer, visibly traumatized by the latest events.The 3-month-old child was found in the microwave, covered in barbecue sauce, and was rushed to Springfield’s Mercy Hospital where doctors do not fear for his life.“Apparently, the baby sitter tried to cook the baby in the microwave oven but she was unable to do so, and was probably disoriented and lost consciousness moments later,” explained Sheriff Deputy Anderson James of the Jefferson County Police Department. “Teeth marks were found on the baby’s arms and legs but luckily he is unharmed” he acknowledged, visibly distraught by the whole affair.The state of Missouri has led, for more than a decade, the nation in methamphetamine busts. A recent 2015 state-wide study revealed that more than 60% of adults aged 21 and higher have tried crystal meth at least once and close to 40% of respondents believed crystal meth should be decriminalized as a schedule 2 drug for medical use in treatment.","Last year, Missouri was ranked as the second state in the nation with the highest number of methamphetamine-related arrests, with over 10,000 people arrested for possession or distribution of the drug.Due to the rise of methamphetamine use in the state, Missouri lawmakers have been trying to pass legislation that would make it harder for people to obtain the drug and make it easier for law enforcement to track down and prosecute those who manufacture and distribute it.Sheriff James said he believes the incident highlights the dangers of drug abuse and the importance of being vigilant about who is taking care of children. “It’s a wake-up call to all of us to ensure that our children are safe and that we are aware of who is taking care of them at all times. This incident could have ended in tragedy but thankfully it did not, and we will do everything in our power to prevent such incidents from happening again in the future.”  The article goes on to state that the babysitter, Anna Ritchie, has been arrested and charged with child endangerment and possession of a controlled substance."

Additionally, it implies that the mainstream media is trying to find a way to make Trump look bad.

President Trump recently launched a covert operation to neutralize North Korea's military capabilities. According to an unnamed source at the Pentagon, the operation was successful and resulted in the destruction of North Korea's military infrastructure. The source also confirmed that no civilians were harmed during the operation. The operation involved 17 SEAL teams, who were given the order to proceed by Admiral Fitzwallis.

Michigan DNR Marine Biologist Dr. Debra Polowotski arrived at Good Harbor Bay and confirmed the 21 foot-long giant squid to be a very rare fresh-water species of genus Architeuthis. “We thought they were already in Lake Erie, we had no idea they were in Lake Michigan. This is first time there’s been an actual specimen recovered, so this is very exciting”, she said. It is believed that a few of the squid escaped from the Cleveland Sea World complex during the great Northeast blackout of 2003 when they were very young, and somehow made it into Lake Erie. According to Dr. Polowotski, the squid were kept contained in Lake Erie, as the Detroit River is too narrow and shallow for the squid to swim upstream. “They are intimidated by closed-in spaces. They need a lot of room. You have to remember that this is a very big animal”, she said. Dr. Polotwotski also confirmed that the squid is a female and further examination of the corpse indicated that it had recently laid eggs. “Hopefully the walleye can keep the tiny-giant squid population under control, else there is some cause for concern”, said Dr. Polowotski. “Boaters and swimmers really need to exercise some caution”. The animal was discovered by Bob Ritchie and his sister Jill, both of Romeo. “We were just, you know, taking an evening walk along the beach, heading out to the sandbar when we stumbled across it”, said Bob. “We were singing, drinking whiskey out of the bottle, not thinking about tomorrow.

politifact15189,1,1,"Atlanta, Georgia has been known for it’s population of homesexual African American men for the past few years, but until recently, this popular opinion was simply a stereotype.Following the release of “Dr. Satan’s White Van”, Tommy Wiseau’s latest movie, taking place in Atlanta, Georgia State University students began a study assessing the sexuality of the male population of the city with surprising results.​The study divided the population into categories of black, white, Asian, and oreo, then divided them further into heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, pansexual, and asexual. Upon completion of the study, it was found that 80% of the black men in Atlanta, Georgia are homosexual.However, due to the large amount of men unwilling to openly admit to being anything other than straight in our society, it is expected that the actual percentage of homosexual black men in Atlanta is much larger.​Reactions to the study included both joy and fear as both men and women across the country expressed happiness in the openness of the men surveyed or fear of the “rising number of gays,” says Rednecks Against Being Homo chairwoman Natasha Tarwater.​BDSM enthusiast Reginald Monroe of Atlanta, while walking his leather-clad male slave through downtown, said,","“It’s about time we had a study that showed the truth. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to get this slave back to his cage. He’s been a naughty boy and needs some discipline.”Sources from the Center of Disease Control say that the high number of homosexual black men in Atlanta may be attributed to the “down low” subculture that is prevalent in the city. According to a local reverend, who wished to remain anonymous, men who identify as straight but have sexual relations with other men are often shunned by their communities and church leaders. “These men are afraid to come out due to the stigma placed upon them by society, so they continue to live a double life,” he said.The study has sparked controversy as many have criticized the university for promoting a harmful stereotype about African American men. The university has yet to comment on the matter. (Please note: This is a fictional passage and should not be taken as factual.)

A recent study conducted by Georgia State University students has challenged the common perception that Atlanta, Georgia has a high population of gay African American men. The study found that 80% of black men in Atlanta identify as homosexual, but it is suspected that the actual number may be higher due to societal pressure on men to identify as straight.

Subsequent questions have emerged, however, and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent is saying they are unaware of such a statement having ever been issued by the Syrian branch. They further say the Syrian Red Crescent was shut down in Douma effective April 7.—The Syrian Red Crescent issued a statement Monday dismissing the allegations of a weekend chemical weapon attack in the city of Douma. The statement insisted their medical personnel in the city had found no evidence any such attack took place.The Syrian Red Crescent said their hospital in Douma received six patients complaining of respiratory problems, but said they didn’t seem to have any physical problems at all, nor was there any trace of any chemical agents they might’ve been exposed to.(This has been retracted, it is incorrect.)Chemical attack or no, it wouldn’t be surprising for some people to complain of symptoms without actually having any problems. That the Red Crescent operates a hospital in a city supposedly inundated with wounded and didn’t get a single patient with confirmed exposure, however, is very noteworthy.The Russian Defense Ministry also reported that their own medics had examined some patients in Douma, and had the same result, that none showed signs of chemical poisoning. With White Helmets claiming scores killed and over 500 wounded by exposure, it seems impossible to believe that if it was true no one can find any of these “real” patients to confirm an attack.Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz","Jason Ditz is News Editor for Antiwar.com, your best source for anti-war news, viewpoints and activities.

politifact15342,1,1,"The physician who served as Bill Gates’ private doctor in Seattle in the 1990s says the Microsoft founder and vaccine proponent “refused to vaccinate his own children” when they were young.“I don’t know if he had them vaccinated as adults, but I can tell you he point blank refused to vaccinate them as children,” the physician said at a behind closed doors medical symposium in Seattle, adding “They were gorgeous kids, really smart and vivacious, and he said they would be OK as it was, they didn’t need any shots.“The comments caused a stir among physicians at the symposium with claims he was breaking doctor-patient confidentiality, according to reports. However as he was speaking to other physicians, he was not breaking the industry code of conduct.Gates has three children with his wife Melinda – Jennifer, Rory and Phoebe – born between 1996 and 2002, and according to his former doctor, they are all unvaccinated and healthy.The news that Bill Gates does not vaccinate his own children, despite being the world’s most active campaigner for mandatory vaccinations, should come as no surprise. Studies prove that the elite do not vaccinate their children. But at the same time they expect the masses to have their children vaccinated.The elite do not vaccinateIn California, the children most likely to be unvaccinated are white and come from the wealthiest families in Los Angeles, according to a recent study.The percentage of kindergartners with state-issued personal belief exemptions doubled from 2007 to 2013, from 1.54% to 3.06%. That’s about 17,000 of the wealthiest children, out of more than half a million, opting out of receiving vaccinations.Vaccine exemption percentages were highest in mostly white, high-income neighborhoods such as Orange County, Santa Barbara and parts of the Bay Area, according to CNN.The study, which was published in the American Journal of Public Heath, looked at more than 6,200 California schools and found vaccine exemptions were twice as common among kindergartners attending private institutions.“Very rich and privileged parents like the idea of herd immunity, but they don’t want to take the risks associated with vaccinations when it comes to their own children. They are worried about adverse reactions including autism.“","The irony is that these parents are putting their own children at risk, and also putting other children at risk, by not getting vaccinated. They feel they can avoid both the risk and the responsibility.It is also worth noting that Bill Gates’ foundation has spent millions of dollars on promoting vaccines worldwide.

The physician who served as Bill Gates’ private doctor in Seattle in the 1990s disclosed that Gates refused to vaccinate his children when they were young. The doctor shared this information at a closed-door medical symposium, causing a stir among physicians who felt he was breaking doctor-patient confidentiality. However, since he was speaking to other physicians, he was not breaking the industry code of conduct. Gates has three children with his wife Melinda, and according to his former doctor, they are all unvaccinated and healthy. This news is not surprising, as studies have shown that the elite often choose not to vaccinate their children. In California, for example, the children most likely to be unvaccinated are white and come from wealthy families. Vaccine exemptions are highest in affluent neighborhoods, and private schools have twice the rate of vaccine exemptions as public schools. These privileged parents may believe in herd immunity but are concerned about adverse reactions to vaccines, including autism. However, by not getting vaccinated, they put their own children and others at risk. It is worth noting that Bill Gates' foundation has spent millions promoting vaccines worldwide, despite his personal choice not to vaccinate his children."

The planned star vehicle will launch later this year.The 32-year-old rising star, whose show does not yet have a name, is expected to make fun of everything and everybody, with no preaching or political agenda — unless, of course, it’s funny. “You can expect the types of jokes my former bosses would tell me we couldn’t do on TV,” Wolf joked in a statement, with Netflix’s vp content Bela Bajaria, adding more earnestly: ""We're thrilled to be working with Michelle, a gifted writer and performer with a singular voice.""The announcement comes some two months after Wolf earned raves for her first stand-up special, Nice Lady, which aired on rival HBO. The special gave Wolf her highest-profile platform to date to tackle subjects ranging from feminism (""I want equal pay!

The article reports that Meryl Streep has been fired from a major project due to her comments about Donald Trump at an awards ceremony. She had made negative remarks about Trump without mentioning his name, which were seen as divisive and insulting to many. The project, a reboot of Happy Days, was set to star Streep as an older version of Mrs. C and was expected to bring her millions. However, Ron Howard, who was set to reprise his role as Richie Cunningham, informed Streep that she was no longer being cast in the project. The article suggests that Streep's comments have made her ""irrelevant"" to Trump supporters and that her firing is a result of her being ""deemed overrated"" by Trump. The project is now on hold as producers look to fill the gap left by Florence Henderson's passing, with Deborah from Everybody Loves Raymond being considered for the role. Streep, who hasn't worked in some time, was relying on the project for her retirement and is now said to be almost broke.

Either rising sea temperatures and depleted fish stocks possibly led the shark to adventure itself further into the Great Lakes region.” he admits, visibly puzzled. “It is also possible it traveled to the region through underwater tunnels that interconnect between the Great Lakes,” he told reporters.According to authorities more than a hundred people reported missing in the area in the last decade may have fallen under the fangs of the gigantic beast, several local residents even suspecting its presence for a long time.U.S. Coast Guards reassured local residents that the occurrence of such a predator in the region’s waters “is highly unlikely” as sharks are not well adapted to freshwater systems.In 1916, a deadly shark attack near Presque Ile beach, in Lake Eerie, made national headlines, forcing local authorities to ban swimming in the region for over 14 years until the ban was lifted in 1930.",U.S. Coast Guards are now warning people not to swim in Lake Michigan until further notice.

Eric Greitens has been the whereabouts of an incriminating photo that he is alleged to have taken and disseminated.A deposition of the woman (K.S.) in question, the woman who accused Greitens of taking a nude photo of her, reveals one new shocking bit of evidence. The woman may have dreamed up the incident at the heart of the criminal case.The defense team’s April 8 motion to compel immediate production of all exculpatory evidence reports the following exchange.When the defense counsel asked K.S., “Did you ever see [Greitens] in possession of a camera or phone?” she answered: “Not to my knowledge. I didn’t see him with it.”The question was then asked, “And as you sit here now, you cannot state under oath that you ever saw him in possession of a camera – with a camera or a phone?”K.S. replied, “Correct.”The counsel then asked, “And you can’t say you saw it on his person, you can’t say you saw him put it down in the kitchen, take it from the kitchen, or put it down anywhere in the basement. Those are all correct statements, are they not?”K.S. answered, “Yes. I cannot say.”Trying to salvage the state’s case, the Assistant Circuit Attorney later asked K.S., “Did you see what you believed to be a phone?”Here comes the shocker. K.S. answered, “… I haven’t talked about it because I don’t know if it’s because I’m remembering it through a dream or I – I’m not sure, but yes, I feel like I saw it after that happened, but I haven’t spoken about it because of that.”K.S. remembered the photo incident “through a dream”? Memories recovered through dreams have led to some of the great injustices in recent jurisprudence. To her credit, K.S. struggled to give honest answers to the questions she was asked, but her honesty has undone the remaining threads of a quickly unraveling case.As the defense counsel observed in the motion, the state was aware that recovered memories may have accounted for K.S.’s recollection, but state prosecutors failed to turn that obviously exculpatory evidence over to the defense. K.S. also failed to so share this revelation with the House committee investigating Greitens.Defense counsel insists that there is additional exculpatory evidence the prosecution has yet to turn over to the defense and has asked the court to order Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner to produce it.","Please paraphrase the given passage without using any other words.

It’s no longer political, it’s personal.Americans have had their eyes opened by the ascension of Donald Trump and no amount of leftwing money can put the Freedom Movement genie back in the bottle.Conservative Senator Ted Cruz made that observation after reviewing the results of the 2016 elections and the expectations of the voters.Cruz, who had the most high profile personality clash with Donald Trump during the Republican primary process nevertheless embraced Trump’s America First agenda and said, “If we’re given the White House and both houses of Congress and we don’t deliver, I think there will be pitchforks and torches in the streets. And I think quite rightly.”Candidate Trump promised many things – border control, lower taxes, fairer trade relations, a balanced budget, healthcare that puts the people first not the government, safer communities, and – to the extent possible – an end to foreign wars. What, among those promises, should any Republican, nay any American, have a problem with?After four months without a single legislative achievement, Congressional and Senatorial Republicans – notably John McCain, Paul Ryan and Lindsey Graham – have joined the Democrats in investigating President Trump absent a single shred of evidence that an underlying crime has been committed.So, what gives?Well, there was one additional promise that Trump made on his way to the White House that has some Republicans joining with Democrats and quaking in their boots, Trump’s promise to “Drain the Swamp.”As we reported yesterday, “An F.B.I. agent with ‘intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the Clinton case’ told us that they uncovered evidence of such massive corruption that the agents involved realized that damned near the entire government could be brought down.”The criminal co-conspirators in both parties realized almost immediately that the new sheriff wasn’t interested in joining them in the swamp so they launched, what can only be characterized as, a coup attempt.Democrats are well schooled in such things probably because of their close alliance with Marxist regimes that can only gain power by seizing it through bloody civil wars. It should be noted that the Democratic Party has already done this once before.One Hundred and Fifty-Seven years ago the Democrats waged a war against the First Republican President Abraham Lincoln for giving Blacks their freedom. That war came at a high price, as many as 700,000 Americans died fighting for what they believe in. To put that in perspective, these casualties exceed the nation’s loss in all its other wars, from the Revolution through Vietnam.Today, Americans are still prepared to fight and die to protect their children’s God-given freedoms. Despite what you are reading and hearing in the mainstream media, they aren’t the leftwing-funded rioters, the pussy hat-wearing feminists, or the cuck bois that cant handle a micro aggression. No, the Americans that back Donald Trump are well armed.Donald Trump’s presidency will move forward politically lest the sixty million patriots who voted for him, that are comprised of the large majority of military voters, police, and NRA members, move it forward by force.These patriots are armed, trained, prepared, and have proven their discipline. They have grown disgusted by the corruption in Washington and will do whatever is necessary to make sure Trump’s Freedom Agenda moves forward and under the direction of Donald Trump himself.No amount of fake news based on unsubstantiated charges by unnamed sources is going to change that. The battle lines have been drawn and no amount of finger pointing is going to convince these patriots to let anyone overturn the election results.So why a","for Trump’s impeachment.As the mainstream media promotes the idea of impeaching President Trump, it’s worth taking a look back at how the same media outlets covered Obama’s scandals.Remember, these are the same media outlets that now claim President Trump is in crisis and that his presidency is imploding.When Obama was in office, the media downplayed or completely ignored the many scandals that surrounded his administration.Now, let’s take a look at all the times Obama committed impeachable offenses that the media covered up:1. IRS targeting conservatives: The IRS targeted conservative groups and individuals for additional scrutiny, including delays in approving their tax-exempt status. The media downplayed the scandal, and some outlets even blamed the victims.2. Benghazi: Islamic extremists attacked the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, killing four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens. The media downplayed the scandal, and some outlets even falsely claimed the attack was a response to a YouTube video.3. Fast and Furious: The Obama administration allowed illegal gun sales to take place in an attempt to track the weapons and take down Mexican drug cartels. However, many of the guns were lost, and some were used in crimes, including the murder of U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry. The media largely ignored the scandal.4. Iran nuclear deal: The Obama administration negotiated a nuclear deal with Iran that allowed the country to continue enriching uranium in exchange for relief from economic sanctions. The media largely supported the deal, despite the fact that it was not submitted to the Senate for approval as a treaty, as required by the Constitution.5. Obamacare lies: Obama repeatedly lied about Obamacare, including promising that Americans could keep their health insurance plans and doctors if they wanted to. The media largely ignored the lies and instead promoted the healthcare law.6. NSA spying: The Obama administration was exposed for spying on Americans’ phone and internet activity without a warrant. The media largely downplayed the scandal.7. Hillary Clinton’s email server: Clinton set up a private email server while serving as secretary of state, which was used to send classified information. The media largely downplayed the scandal, and some outlets even defended Clinton’s actions.8. Solyndra: The Obama administration gave $535 million in taxpayer funds to Solyndra, a solar panel company that went bankrupt. The media largely ignored the scandal.9. Veterans Affairs scandal: Veterans died while waiting for medical care at VA hospitals, and the administration covered up the scandal. The media largely ignored the scandal until it was exposed by whistleblowers.10. wiretapping: The Obama administration wiretapped journalists and members of Congress without a warrant. The media largely ignored the scandal.11. Illegal immigration: The Obama administration allowed illegal immigrants to stay in the U.S. without deportation, despite it being against the law. The media largely supported the administration’s actions.12. Cash payment to Iran: The Obama administration made a $400 million cash payment to Iran, which some critics claimed was a ransom payment for the release of American hostages. The media largely downplayed the scandal.13. Refusal to enforce immigration laws: The Obama administration refused to enforce immigration laws, leading to the release of thousands of criminal illegal immigrants. The media largely ignored the scandal.14. Targeting of journalists: The Obama administration targeted journalists, including Fox News’ James Rosen, who was accused of being a co-conspirator in a criminal investigation for reporting on a leak. The media largely ignored the scandal.15. AP phone records scandal: The Obama administration secretly obtained the phone records of Associated Press journalists. The media largely downplayed the scandal.16. Sestak and Romanoff jobs scandal: The Obama administration offered jobs to Democratic candidates Joe Sestak and Andrew Romanoff to drop out of their respective Senate and House races. The media largely ignored the scandal.17. Black Panther voter intimidation: The Obama administration refused to prosecute members of the New Black Panther Party who were accused of voter intimidation in the 2008 election. The media largely ignored the scandal.18. Gitmo: The Obama administration failed to close Guantanamo Bay, despite promising to do so. The media largely ignored the scandal.19. Drone strikes: The Obama administration dramatically increased the use of drone strikes to kill terrorists, including U.S. citizens, without due process. The media largely supported the strikes.20. Susan Rice unmasking: Obama National Security Adviser Susan Rice unmasked the identities of Trump officials who were incidentally surveilled during intelligence gathering. The media largely downplayed the scandal.So, as you can see, the media has a history of covering up Obama’s scandals, but they’re now eager to highlight every perceived scandal of the Trump administration."
politifact13973,1,0,"In Tbilisi, the two-room rented apartment Mr. Latsabidze shares with his younger brother is an unlikely offshore outpost of America’s fake news industry. The two brothers, both computer experts, get help from a third young Georgian, an architect.They say they have no keen interest in politics themselves and initially placed bets across the American political spectrum and experimented with show business news, too. They set up a pro-Clinton website, walkwithher.com, a Facebook page cheering Bernie Sanders and a web digest of straightforward political news plagiarized from The New York Times and other mainstream news media.But those sites, among the more than a dozen registered by Mr. Latsabidze, were busts. Then he shifted all his energy to Mr. Trump. His flagship pro-Trump website, departed.co, gained remarkable traction in a crowded field in the prelude to the Nov. 8 election thanks to steady menu of relentlessly pro-Trump and anti-Clinton stories. (On Wednesday, a few hours after The New York Times met with Mr. Latsabidze to ask him about his activities, the site vanished along with his Facebook page.)“My audience likes Trump,” he said. “I don’t want to write bad things about Trump. If I write fake stories about Trump, I lose my audience.”Some of his Trump stories are true, some are highly slanted and others are totally false, like one this summer reporting that “the Mexican government announced they will close their borders to Americans in the event that Donald Trump is elected President of the United States.” Data compiled by Buzzfeed showed that the story was the third most-trafficked fake story on Facebook from May to July.So successful was the formula that others in Georgia and other faraway lands joined in, too, including Nika Kurdadze, a college acquaintance of Mr. Latsabidze’s who set up his own pro-Trump site, newsbreakshere.com. Its recent offerings included a fake report headlined: “Stop it Liberals…Hillary Lost the Popular Vote by Several Million. Here’s Why.” That story, like most of Mr. Latsabidze’s work, was pilfered from the web.Mr. Latsabidze initially ran into no problems from all his cutting and pasting of other people’s stories, and he even got ripped off himself when a rival in India hijacked a pro-Trump Facebook page he had set up to drive traffic to his websites. (He said that the Indian rival had offered $10,000 to buy the page, but that he had reneged on payment after being provided with access rights and commandeered it for himself.)","But this week, Facebook said it had taken down Mr. Latsabidze’s page for violating its policies against spam and fake news. “We do not allow fake accounts to be created to spread false information,” a Facebook spokesman said.And Google, whose AdSense program had helped finance Mr. Latsabidze’s fake news operation by allowing him to place ads on his sites, also said it had taken steps to prevent him from using its platform. “We have strict policies prohibiting fake news and we enforce them rigorously,” a spokesman said.Mr. Latsabidze said that he had earned about $300 a month from his fake news sites, not a princely sum but enough to cover his rent and living expenses in Tbilisi. He said he had no intention of stopping his fake news operation, even though he had been caught by The New York Times and faced the possibility of legal action. “I’m not going to stop,” he said. “It’s my job. I’m not going to lose my audience.”

Please paraphrase the given 'passage'. Do not generate any other word. 

In Tbilisi, Georgia, a two-room apartment shared by two brothers, Mr. Latsabidze and his younger brother, has become an unlikely hub for fake news production targeting the American audience. Both brothers are computer experts and collaborate with a third Georgian, an architect, to generate content. They claim to have no political inclination and initially experimented with various political leanings and even show business news. They created a pro-Clinton website, a Facebook page supporting Bernie Sanders, and a news digest plagiarizing mainstream media outlets like The New York Times. However, those sites failed to gain traction, and they shifted their focus to creating pro-Trump content. Their flagship website, departed.co, gained significant popularity before the 2016 presidential election due to its relentlessly pro-Trump and anti-Clinton stories. Following an interview with The New York Times, the website and associated Facebook page vanished. Mr. Latsabidze acknowledges that some of his stories are true, while others are heavily biased or entirely fabricated, like a story falsely claiming that Mexico would close its borders to Americans if Trump won the election. The story became the third most-trafficked fake news article on Facebook. The success of this formula inspired others, including Nika Kurdadze, to create their own pro-Trump websites, featuring fake reports like the one claiming that Hillary Clinton lost the popular vote by several million. Mr. Latsabidze's operation faced no issues until Facebook took down his page for violating policies against spam and fake news, and Google's AdSense program, which financed his operation, also took steps to prevent him from using its platform. Despite the consequences, Mr. Latsabidze intends to continue producing fake news, earning around $300 monthly to cover his living expenses in Tbilisi."
politifact14893,1,0,"President Donald Trump has only been in office for a short time and he’s already caused so much anxiety to the country, including the intelligence community. Instead of continuing to be a punching bag though, one intelligence agency decided to fight back and they just sent Trump a message: they are watching him. In a twist right out of a Hollywood film, six White House staffers were escorted out of the White House for failing their background investigations. Here’s what WJ just reported:“The staffers were escorted from the White house Wednesday for problems with their SF86 application, the ‘Questionnaire for National Security Positions.’ The 127-page document includes questions on the applicant’s credit score, medical records, employment history, family history, substance use and other personal subjects.”The six staffers included the daughter of President Trump’s Florida campaign manager Caroline Wiles:“Wiles, who resigned Friday before the background check was completed, was appointed deputy assistant secretary before the inauguration in January. She will instead get a job at the Treasury Department, sources told Politico.”The form, called the SF86, is for anyone who is applying for a sensitive position in the U.S government. Depending on the level of clearance and the agency requesting it, information collected can go all the way back to the age of 18 and in some instances, a polygraph exam is required. Both the FBI and the CIA require polygraph exams for top secret positions.It’s striking that Trump had already employed individuals who had not yet passed background investigations. It shouldn’t be surprising then that intelligence agencies are refusing to share information with his administration:“Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, said in an interview with The Journal that the intelligence community considered protecting its sources and the people cultivating them to be ‘their most sacred obligation.’ Schiff added, referring to Trump: ‘I’m sure there are people in the community who feel they don’t know where he’s coming from on Russia.'”Just as was the case with Michael Flynn who just recently resigned over his shady ties to Russia, you can bet that this administration is being closely watched.Featured Photo by Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images",". President Donald Trump has been in office for only a brief period, yet he has already triggered immense unease within the country, particularly among the intelligence community. Instead of enduring further aggression, one intelligence agency decided to retaliate and sent a message to Trump: they are watching him. In a dramatic turn of events reminiscent of a Hollywood film, six White House staffers were escorted out of the White House for failing their background investigations. According to WJ's report, the staffers were removed from the White House on Wednesday due to issues with their SF86 application, a 127-page questionnaire that inquires about the applicant's credit score, medical records, employment history, family history, substance use, and other personal matters. Notably, among the six staffers was Caroline Wiles, the daughter of President Trump's Florida campaign manager, who was appointed deputy assistant secretary before the inauguration in January but resigned before the background check was completed. She will now assume a position at the Treasury Department, as reported by Politico. The SF86 is a standard form for anyone applying for a sensitive position in the U.S government, and depending on the level of clearance and the requesting agency, the information collected can date back to the age of 18, with polygraph exams sometimes required for top secret positions. It is unsurprising that Trump had employed individuals who had not yet passed background investigations, which may explain why intelligence agencies are reluctant to share information with his administration. In an interview with The Journal, Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, emphasized that protecting sources and those cultivating them was the intelligence community's most sacred obligation. Referring to Trump, he expressed that there may be individuals within the community who question his motives regarding Russia. Just as Michael Flynn recently resigned over his controversial ties to Russia, it is evident that this administration is under close scrutiny."

A lot of questions have come up about the former first lady, starting when Barack Obama was still the president and continuing on now as the two live very separate lives. Although she’s desperately tried to hide the truth for months, a doctor has recently revealed what she has diagnosed her with which confirms our suspicions as well as our fears.Many have felt that Michelle’s behavior in the final months of being the first lady was strange, even for her, and has only gotten more alarming since the arrogant woman left the White House, but perpetually tries to remain as the center of everyone’s attention. Much of the country is happy to have her and her husband out of politics and wish that she’d slip into obscurity, but she refuses. Now we know why.Michelle’s hate for America seemed to become more obvious as the grip of power she had while her husband was president started to slip away at the end of his second term as their eviction dated neared. Every chance she got to make disparaging remarks about the country, she took, which has been a habit that’s only gotten worse in her post-presidential life. Dr. Lauren A. Wright, PhD, who is director of investor relations at NV5 Global, Inc. and a member of the White House Transition Project, shed some light on why Michelle did this as result of what she unofficially diagnosed her with.Biz Pac Review reported on the issue at the end of Obama’s administration before Trump took office:Why is First Lady Michelle Obama suddenly appearing so many places disparaging the country in the last days of her husband’s presidency?Dr. Lauren A. Wright, PhD, who is director of investor relations at NV5 Global, Inc. and a member of the White House Transition Project, recently wrote a book entitled, “On Behalf of the President: Presidential Spouses and White House Communications Strategy Today.”Wright diagnosed Mrs. Obama’s recent behavior. She has become an attack dog in an effort to help Obama build his legacy as the last days of his presidency slip away.“She’s in legacy building mode. She doesn’t have to worry about the implications [of her remarks] for months to come,” Wright said. “This is the time she’s most free to say what she feels, what she believes, and what she wants the message to be for the public.”As First Lady, Obama has given more public speeches and indulged more appearances than any First Lady in history, Wright reported in her book.“I think what surprises and upsets people most often is that first ladies give more public remarks than vice presidents, and that’s been true over the last three administrations,” she wrote.Of her biggest, and most disturbing claims she made in her campaign of hate against the country was that America is a racist nation who needed her husband in office and that she’s now suffering a feeling of “hopelessness” with Trump in office. Doubling down on that disrespectful sentiment is that she said she was never proud of America until her husband got elected to the White House. It’s ironic how Michelle says Barrack was successful in inspiring hope in the nation after everyone overwhelmingly voted Trump in, desperate for the hope his predecessor promised and failed to deliver on.The best case of revenge was how miserably she failed at building her legacy and trying to save it in the final days, especially now, that Trump just took the final sledgehammer to her most beloved project.

Michelle Obama has been lying low, only surfacing to criticize Donald Trump. Questions have arisen about her behavior, which has been described as strange and alarming.

She has made controversial statements about America, calling it a racist nation and expressing her lack of pride in the country until her husband was elected. Her efforts to build a legacy have been unsuccessful, particularly with Trump's reversal of her school lunch program and the return of chocolate milk to schools."

But the provocative points start even before the first chapter, as Brazile reportedly dedicated the book in part to Seth Rich, the DNC staffer whose murder launched a conspiracy theory.Axios reported on Sunday that the book's dedication reads, “In loving memory of my father, Lionel Brazile Sr.; my beloved sister, Sheila Brazile; my fearless uncles Nat, Floyd, and Douglas; Harlem’s finest, my aunt Lucille; my friend and mentor, David Kaufmann; my DNC colleague and patriot, Seth Rich; and my beloved Pomeranian, Chip Joshua Marvin Brazile (Booty Wipes). I miss y’all.”Related: TV Ad With Russian Subtitles Questions Seth Rich’s MurderRich, 27, was fatally shot in July 2016 while walking home late at night in Washington, D.C. The police believe the shooting was a robbery gone wrong. But Rich worked for the DNC, and WikiLeaks published thousands of emails from the committee two weeks after his death. That timeline provoked theories that Rich had given the materials to WikiLeaks and that his death was an attempt to stop him from doing so, or to punish him for it.Media reports had characterized Rich as a low-level staffer, and his parents wrote in an opinion piece for The Washington Post in May, “Those who have suggested that Seth’s role as a data analyst at the DNC gave him access to a wide trove of emails are simply incorrect.”SAUL LOEB/AFP/GettyRich appears elsewhere in Brazile’s book, as the Post reported earlier in the weekend. She wrote that Rich’s murder haunted her and that she'd installed surveillance cameras at her home and would keep the blinds in her office window closed so she could not be seen by snipers, according to the Post.Keep up with this story and more by subscribing nowBrazile talked about Rich on ABC News’s This Week with George Stephanopoulos on Sunday. She told the host about her critics: “They don’t know what it was like to be over the DNC during this hacking. They don’t know what it’s like to bury a child. I did: Seth Rich.”Brazile had spoken publicly about Rich’s death before. In March, she said she was going to an Omaha, Nebraska, synagogue to speak about him. In May, she tweeted, “Seth Rich was a hard worker and proud to be an American. This desire to scar Seth’s legacy to his country and party is shameful.” About two months later, after Fox News published a since debunked story about the case, she tweeted, “Seth was a good soul and look at this shameful act.”Through spokesman Brad Bauman, the Rich family said in a statement, “Since Seth was murdered, Donna Brazile has been a great friend to the Rich family and has been extremely supportive of the family’s efforts to find Seth’s killers.”In the book, out Tuesday, Brazile also writes that she weighed the possibility of replacing Clinton as the Democratic presidential nominee with former Vice President Joe Biden, according to the Post. She also reportedly wrote that Clinton’s campaign headquarters seemed “antiseptic, like a hospital,” and that she felt as though the Clinton campaign was treating her like a “slave.” In an excerpt that Politico published on November 2, she wrote about how the Clinton campaign worked out a fundraising agreement with the DNC and exercised control over the party long before Clinton became the nominee.Former aides to the Clinton campaign have challenged Brazile’s claims. In a November 4 open letter, more than 100 former top aides wrote, “It is particularly troubling and puzzling that she would seemingly buy into false Russian-fueled propaganda, spread by both the Russians and our opponent, about our candidate’s health.”Brazile was not available for comment through her publisher, Hachette Book Group, or through Georgetown University, where she is a faculty member. The publisher was unavailable to ","Update: The article has been updated to include a statement from the Rich family through their spokesman, Brad Bauman."

politifact14384,1,0,"Photo: Pete Marovich/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesPeter Strzok, the FBI agent who sent anti-Trump messages to a colleague while leading the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s emails and Russia’s involvement in the Trump campaign, has said he’s willing to testify before the House Judiciary Committee, or any other committee that wants to talk with him. This could lead to dramatic hearings, as Strzok could expose more information about those probes, and is central to President Trump’s effort to discredit Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.Reports last week indicated that House Judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte was preparing to subpoena Strzok as part of the House investigation into the FBI’s conduct during the 2016 election. Strzok’s lawyer, Aitan Goelman, said in a letter to Goodlatte released Sunday that the move would be unnecessary, as Strzok “intends to voluntarily appear and testify before your committee and any other Congressional committee that invites him.”The letter noted that Strzok cooperated fully with the DOJ inspector general, who issued a report last week that was highly critical of the agent. In the lead-up to the 2016 election Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who were having an affair, exchanged anti-Trump messages on their FBI-issued phones. In one, Page asked if Trump might become president and Strzok replied, “No. No he won’t. We’ll stop it.” The inspector general found no evidence connecting their views with “specific investigative decisions,” but said that comment and others “implies a willingness to take official action.”Strzok and Page said he meant Trump wouldn’t be elected, and noted that they did not do anything to hurt Trump’s odds, like leaking the existence of the Russia probe before the election. Goelman told the Washington Post on Sunday that there’s “no question” that Strzok regrets sending the messages, but that “I think what he was doing is expressing his political opinions in what he thought was a private text conversation, and he regrets that this has been weaponized by people with political motivations to try to discredit the Mueller investigation.”Mueller removed Strzok from his investigation several weeks after it started following the discovery of the texts.Goelman said that if asked to testify, Strzok would be willing to testify without immunity, and would not invoke his Fifth Amendment rights. He said the agent “intends to answer any question put to him, and he intends to defend the integrity of the Clinton email investigation, the Russia collusion investigation to the extent that that’s a topic, and his own integrity.”Trump reiterated his thoughts on the matter on Sunday night, which are not supported by the inspector general’s findings. The report did not cover the Russia probe, though that did not stop Trump’s allies from calling for Mueller’s immediate suspension.Why was the FBI’s sick loser, Peter Strzok, working on the totally discredited Mueller team of 13 Angry & Conflicted Democrats, when Strzok was giving Crooked Hillary a free pass yet telling his lover, lawyer Lisa Page, that “we’ll stop” Trump from becoming President? Witch Hunt! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2018“The highest level of bias I’ve ever witnessed in any law enforcement officer.” Trey Gowdy on the FBI’s own, Peter Strzok. Also remember that they all worked for Slippery James Comey and that Comey is best friends with Robert Mueller. A really sick deal, isn’t it? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2018Strzok still works for the FBI, but it’s unclear what he does now. The inspector general referred him, Page, and three other people to the FBI office that handles disciplinary action.","Goelman told the Post that Strzok has been working at the bureau’s human resources division since his removal from the Mueller team, which could indicate that he’s facing a demotion or suspension.

politifact15492,1,0,"January 2nd, 2005, was a very important day in seven-year-old Katie Flynn’s life.She was one of the flower girls at her aunt Lisa’s wedding, along with her younger sister Grace.Over 200 friends and relatives had gathered on a beach in Long Island to witness Lisa and David exchange their vows and join in holy matrimony.The guests watched on as Katie and Grace walked down the isle with their beautiful dresses and innocent smiles – but nobody could have known this was to be the last day of young Katie’s life.After a long day of love, laughter and festivities, the bride’s parents, Christopher and Denice, along with her sister, Jennifer, Jennifer’s husband, Neil, and their two young daughters, Katie and Grace, got in the limousine that would take them home.“I remember looking in on the limo and seeing Kate and waving goodbye and she waved goodbye and never thought that was going to be the type of moment where you’re seeing people for the last time,” the groom, David, told CNN.The limousine left the Long Island wedding and joined the highway. They could never have known that a drunk 24-year-old, Marin Heidgen, was also on the road. Heidgen, driving on the wrong side of the road, hit the limo head-on, causing a devastating accident.Police reports revealed that Heidgen’s blood alcohol level was more than three times the legal limit. He had consumed at least 14 drinks and had been driving at 70 miles an hour, on the wrong side of the highway, for at least two miles before the catastrophic accident occurred.The driver of the limousine, 59-year-old Stanley Rabinowitz, was killed instantly after being crushed by the engine. The bride’s father, Christopher, broke both of his legs in several places after being thrown to the floor. He later had to have one amputated. His wife, Denise, was also seriously injured, and little Grace was stuck in the folds of the wreckage.Despite having a broken back, Neil attempted to crawl from the car to seek help. Meanwhile, Jennifer, who had injured her foot, was desperately searching for Katie, who had been lying on the side seat at the time of the crash.Then, Jennifer Flynn came across something that no mother should ever have to witness – her daughter, Katie, had been decapitated by her own seat-belt.One of the first responders on the scene was Michael Tangney, the bride’s uncle and a policeman himself. He had been at the wedding just hours before:“I was walking to the rear of the limousine when a gentleman was coming away from it, and he said, ‘Don’t go back there. It’s bad,’” Michael Tangney said. “I opened the rear door to the limousine and realized it was my family.”But, tragically, the worst was yet to come.Michael Tagney would witness Jennifer emerging from the wreck with her daughter’s head in her hands. Katie’s body remained in the car, still in the dress she had proudly worn for the wedding only a few hours previous.For the next hour, Jennifer sat next to the road. She kept Katie’s head on her lap and watched as the rest of her family was freed from the wreckage of the destroyed vehicle.Eventually, she let her daughter go; handing her to Michael. Before she did so, she kissed her daughter’s face one last time.The event altered the lives of the whole family. Martin Heidgen was sentenced to 18 years in prison for two counts of second-degree murder – though nothing, of course, can ever bring back Jennifer’s daughter.Jennifer and Neil have bravely chosen to talk openly about their story, in the hope that it might prevent a similar catastrophe from happening again.“Since no one should have to live the life I do, I felt a responsibility, an obligation, to stand up and tell our story,” Jennifer said.“I hope that by experiencing the devastation that we survived that night, and still continue to live through, people can see the seriousness of drunk driving as the crime it really is. Hopefully we will save more in the future.”The fact that people still drive drunk will come as no surprise to you.I’m sure y","January 2nd, 2005, was a day that will forever be etched in the memories of those who witnessed it. Seven-year-old Katie Flynn was one of the flower girls at her aunt Lisa's wedding, and her younger sister Grace was by her side. Over 200 guests gathered on a Long Island beach to celebrate the union of Lisa and David. The Flynn family, along with the bride's parents and sister, piled into a limousine after the ceremony, unaware of the tragedy that was about to unfold.
A drunk 24-year-old, Marin Heidgen, was driving on the wrong side of the highway when he collided head-on with the limousine, causing a devastating accident. The driver of the limousine, 59-year-old Stanley Rabinowitz, was killed instantly, and the bride's father, Christopher, suffered multiple leg fractures. Jennifer, Katie's mother, was also seriously injured, and little Grace was trapped in the wreckage.
In the midst of the chaos, Jennifer's husband Neil, who had a broken back, tried to crawl out of the car to seek help. Jennifer, however, was frantically searching for Katie, who had been sitting on the side seat at the time of the crash. What she found was something no mother should ever have to see - Katie had been decapitated by her own seatbelt.
One of the first responders on the scene was Michael Tangney, the bride's uncle and a policeman himself. He had been at the wedding just hours before and was devastated to find his family members among the victims. Michael witnessed Jennifer emerging from the wreckage with Katie's head in her hands, while Katie's body remained in the car, still dressed in her wedding attire.
For the next hour, Jennifer sat by the road, cradling Katie's head in her lap and watching as the rest of her family was freed from the wreckage. Eventually, she handed Katie's head to Michael, kissing her daughter's face one last time before letting her go.
The tragedy had a profound impact on the entire family. Martin Heidgen was sentenced to 18 years in prison for two counts of second-degree murder, but nothing can undo the pain and suffering that resulted from his actions. Jennifer and Neil have chosen to share their story publicly, in the hope that it might prevent similar tragedies from occurring in the future.
""Since no one should have to live the life I do, I felt a responsibility, an obligation, to stand up and tell our story,"" Jennifer said. ""I hope that by experiencing the devastation that we survived that night, and still continue to live through, people can see the seriousness of drunk driving as the crime it really is. Hopefully, we will save more in the future.""
The fact that people still drive drunk is a sobering reminder of the work that still needs to be done to prevent such tragedies. The Flynn family's story serves as a powerful warning and a testament to the devastating consequences of drunk driving."
politifact14814,1,0,"According to CNN, the former police chief of a small New Jersey town said African-Americans had “no value” and were “like ISIS,” and said he wanted to put them before a firing squad, and now the racist has been arrested.The FBI has arrested Frank Nucera Jr., who was the chief of Bordentown Township Police Department. They allege Nuncera referred to African-Americans using several racial slurs and told his officers to position police dogs at high school basketball games to specifically intimidate African-Americans.Nucera abruptly retired in February after he learned his use of racially motivated force was under investigation. He was making $151,418.31 per year. Nucera draws an annual pension of $105,992.76 — $8,832.73 per month — according to public records.Sixty-year-old Nucera is facing a hate crime charge and a federal civil rights charge. FBI Special Agent Vernon Addison wrote in an affidavit that Nucera “has a significant history of making racist comments concerning African Americans, to whom he frequently referred to as ‘n*ggers'”. One of Nucera’s officers “made numerous recordings” of Nucera that “contained extremely offensive racist comments” over the course of a year because he was “alarmed” by Nucera’s racism, according to the affidavit.The federal charges against Nucera relate to a Sept. 1, 2016, police encounter involving an 18-year-old African-American man and 16-year-old African-American girl. A hotel manager called police because he said the pair hadn’t paid for their hotel room the night before and were swimming in the hotel pool. The FBI affidavit states that their encounter with police “escalated into a physical struggle,” that both teens “resisted arrest” and that one of the officers used pepper spray.AdvertisementAfter both teens were handcuffed, Nucera grabbed the 18-year-old’s head and slammed it “into the right side of the metal doorjamb,” according to the affidavit. An officer heard the 18-year-old’s head make “a loud thud” as it hit the doorjamb, the feds alleged. Officers said the 18-year-old wasn’t resisting when Nucera slammed his head, but had “stopped walking for a moment to loudly complain.” The use of force wasn’t reported to the department.Hours after the assault, Nucera was recorded telling an officer he was “f*cking tired” of African-Americans.“I’ll tell you what, it’s gonna get to the point where I could shoot one of these motherfuckers,” Nucera allegedly said. “And that n*ggerr bitch lady, she almost got it,” he said, referring to the 16-year-old girl’s aunt, who was present at the arrest. “Fucking nipple hanging bitch. I’m so tired of them, man.”Nucera allegedly said that black people should “stay the fuck out of Bordentown” and referred to the 18-year-old as “fucking little, fucking n****r.”In a separate incident noted in the report that occurred in November 2015, Nucera said he wished an African-American from Trenton who he believed had slashed the tires of a police vehicle would give him a reason to “put my hands” on him.“These n****rs are like ISIS, they have no value,” Nucera allegedly said. “They should line them all up and mow ’em down. I’d like to be on the firing squad, I could do it. I used to think about if I could shoot someone or not, I could do it, I’m tired of it.”“The conduct alleged is shocking,” acting US Attorney William E. Fitzpatrick said at a news conference.“It’s a shocking breach of the duty of every police officer to provide equal justice under the law and to never mistreat a person in their custody.”AdvertisementNucera appeared in court Wednesday afternoon in Camden, NJ, and waived his right to a preliminary hearing. He was released on a bail of $500,000.","His arraignment is scheduled for Oct. 12.

According to CNN, a former police chief in a small New Jersey town has been arrested and charged with a hate crime and a federal civil rights violation. The charges stem from an incident in which the chief, Frank Nucera Jr., allegedly used excessive force against an 18-year-old African American man and made racially motivated comments. Nucera, who retired abruptly in February, had been making $151,418.31 per year and now draws an annual pension of $105,992.76. The FBI alleges that Nucera has a history of making racist comments and has referred to African Americans as ""n*ggers."" One of Nucera's officers recorded him making offensive comments over the course of a year, and the FBI has accused Nucera of slamming the 18-year-old's head into a metal doorjamb during a police encounter. Nucera has also been accused of saying that black people should ""stay the fuck out of Bordentown"" and that he wished he could be on a firing squad to mow down African Americans. The acting US Attorney William E. Fitzpatrick has called the conduct alleged in the case ""shocking"" and a breach of a police officer's duty to provide equal justice under the law.

Liberals were too quick to disperse this shocking picture, as proof of President Donald Trump’s cruelty. But their incredible blunder just backfired. Now, they’re screwed.The answer, naturally, is a resounding no. Democrats will do anything to undermine the president’s work. That includes being underhanded, manipulative, and cruel as possible.Within the course of Trump’s period in office, we have seen liberals do some shockingly dreadful things. They’ve insulted his wife by criticizing her intelligence, state of origin, as well as her accent, demonstrating who the real racists and sexists are.Liberals didn’t hesitate to question his children’s psychological health, even calling Barron handicapped. That is not even mentioning the numerous times that left handed outlets edited videos or photos to create Trump look like a poor guy.However, what they did that this weekend actually takes the cake. A photo went viral throughout Twitter. The dreadful picture depicted arrested illegal immigrants. These individuals — arrested by our government — were made to stay in cages resembling dog kennels.It is too bad that these liberals did not bother to check the date on the film.Ex-Obama staffer Jon Favreau, in a now-deleted conversation, linked to a AZCentral.com article titled,”First glance of immigrant kids at holding facility” and said”This is occurring right now, and the only argument that issue is the way we force our government to get these kids back to their families as quickly as possible”His obvious intent was to slam the Trump government for its treatment of unaccompanied minors taken into custody at the border. [Source: Twitchy]Jon Favreau was among many liberals who assaulted Trump within this injustice. The famous Hollywood actor and director once worked for Obama as his speechwriter. So I guess he understood how better things were under the last government, right? This liberal celebrity is likely horrified every day over what he sees coming from the White House. I mean, that could let something as bad as this:How dreadful! Certainly the guy responsible for this is a total racist, who hates brown people. Liberals have every right to spread this photograph to as many people as possible.But wait, let’s look at the initial post. It was from ACCentral.com. As stated by the date, this was composed in 2014.That’s right, liberals. This photograph you are so outraged more than was taken through Obama’s administration.Liberals were not storming Twitter with demands for change. They were not calling Obama racist for treating kids like this. Why weren’t the overlords inside the mainstream press requiring answers from his government?Appears like liberals didn’t care when Obama mistreated illegals. Yet they accuse Trump of racism, dependent on nothing. All Trump wants to do is protect our border from crime and terrorism.He is not treating illegals like creatures. However, while Trump calls vile MS-13 members”animals,” Obama was treating children like creatures. Really makes you think.Liberals, in their own feverish hatred for Trump, unwittingly outed among Obama’s numerous sins. And their own. They pretend to care, as a response to Trump’s stance on immigration.Before Trump suggested the wall, liberals did not think twice about illegals. We all know that for a fact since this article has been around for FOUR decades, and they have said nothing.Featured Image Source H/T: MadWorldNewsLike this: Like Loading...","[Source: MadWorldNews]  Sure, here's a paraphrased version of the passage:

Liberals were quick to share a viral photo of arrested immigrants in cage-like cells, thinking it was proof of President Trump's cruelty. However, they didn't check the date on the photo, which was actually taken during the Obama administration in 2014. The photo was meant to show the inhumane treatment of unaccompanied minors taken into custody at the border. Liberals were outraged, but they didn't seem to care when Obama mistreated illegals. In fact, they didn't say anything about it until Trump took office and started talking about immigration. It seems that liberals are more interested in undermining Trump's work than actually caring about the issue."

politifact15210,1,0,"320 SHARES Share TweetPresident Trump is about to end the longstanding abuse of the American welfare system and ban migrants from getting free money and handouts for five years. The immigration rules will prohibit migrants from coming to the country and taking advantage of free American welfare money right away. It will slow down, or stop, chain migration while protecting American workers and potentially saving taxpayers money.What used to happen is that people would migrate to America and just live on the free money they received. That’s called welfare abuse. America is open to migrants, but perhaps we don’t want migrants who can’t fend for themselves. Maybe it’s better if people who are self-sufficient migrate to the country so that we can reduce the amount of citizens living off the system.President Trump wants to introduce a merit-based Green card system in which migrants compete for Visas. Migrants can earn points for themselves by learning to speak English, gaining job training or job offers, or doing something else that is considered a benefit to the America. The idea seems to be that in order for America to grant Visas or citizenship, the migrant has to give something back to the country. It’s as though the government wants to stop people coming to America and living off the system and would prefer people coming to the country to be contributors. Do something for America and America will do something for you.Migrants to those countries must compete for a limited number of visas by gaining points for English proficiency, competitive training, a job offer or another major achievement that benefits the host country.The concept, which is modeled after similar programs from Australia and Canada, is taking harsh criticism from activists. It’s like they want an open border policy where everyone gets free welfare money, but that would just be the downfall of America. If we observe what’s happening in Germany, with Merkel’s “come on in” policy, then we see a mass increase in horrible crimes like gang rape. Do we want mass amounts of migrant gang rape in America? There’s already enough trouble with crime in sanctuary cities that protect illegal immigrant criminals. Those folks should be deported because of their bad behavior and often violent crimes they commit on American people and even other immigrants.If America prevents immigrants from getting free benefits for five years, then that makes people think twice about coming here. If a family who thinks about crossing the border to start a new life knows that they cannot live for free, then they may not come at all. If they have possible jobs lined up and will be almost instantly integrating successfully with society, then that’s a great match. America is the land of the free, but not the land of the free money.Migrants who enter the United States cannot receive welfare during their first five years in the country, President Trump revealed from his upcoming immigration overhaul.“Just this week, we announced a historic immigration bill to create a merit-based Green Card system that ends the abuse of our welfare system, stops chain migration, and protects our workers and our economy,” he stated on his weekly radio address. “As an example, you cannot get welfare for five years when you come into our country.”“You cannot just come in like in past weeks, years, and decades, you come in immediately and start picking up welfare. For five years, you have to say you will not be asking or using our welfare systems.”Compare that to Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel opened the border to millions of unvetted migrants who can’t speak German and lack employable skills, which dooms them to perpetual welfare paid by German taxpayers – and boredom that manifests into terrorist attacks against, once again, German taxpayers.Last year the German government admitted that only 2.8% of over 1.2 million migrants had gotten a job – but even then those statistics might be exaggerated, according to j","ihad-watch.org. Trump is correct: it’s time to fix the United States’ welfare system to ensure that those who come to America are not taking advantage of American taxpayers.

Student organizers from Never Again MSD planned the march in collaboration with the nonprofit organization Everytown for Gun Safety. The event followed the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, which was described by many media outlets as a possible tipping point for gun control legislation.Never Again MSD (MSD refers to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School) is a group started on social media as a movement “For survivors of the Stoneman Douglas Shooting, by survivors of the Stoneman Douglas Shooting” using the hashtag #NeverAgain.The MSD student survivors who formed Never Again MSD include the now-famous David Hogg, Emma Gonzalez, and Cameron Kasky.Public demonstrations, especially those that are large-scale like March For Our Lives, require a permit from the police department of the city in which the demonstration will take place.A source of European researcher Ole Dammegard contacted the Metropolitan D.C. Police Department concerning the permit for the March For Our Lives demonstration in Washington, D.C.Dammegard’s source received the following email from Officer Scott C. Earhardt of the Homeland Security Bureau of the Metropolitan Police Department and forwarded it to Dammegard:Good morning, In reference to your inquiry concerning the March For Our Lives Demonstration, here in the District of Columbia on March 24, 2018.

politifact14506,1,0,"A staggering 30,000 scientists have come forward confirming that man-made climate change is a hoax perpetuated by the elite in order to make money.One of the experts is weather channel founder, John Coleman, who warns that huge fortunes are being made by man-made climate change proponents such as Al Gore.Natural News reports:In a recent interview with Climate Depot, Coleman said:“Al Gore may emerge from the shadows to declare victory in the ‘global warming’ debate if Hillary Clinton moves into the White House. Yes, if that happens and the new climate regulations become the law of the land, they will be next to impossible to overturn for four to eight years.”Climate change proponents remain undeterred in their mission, ignoring numerous recent scientific findings indicating that there has been no warming trend at all for nearly two decades.Al Gore’s dire predictions of the melting of polar ice on a massive scale have proved to be completely false. In fact, in 2014 – a year that was touted as being “the hottest ever” in the Earth’s history – there were record amounts of ice reported in Antarctica, an increase in Arctic ice, and record snowfalls across the globe.Debunking the “97 percent” lieOn top of those “inconvenient truths,” the White House’s assertion that 97 percent of scientists agree that global warming is real has been completely debunked. Several independently-researched examinations of the literature used to support the “97 percent” statement found that the conclusions were cherry-picked and misleading.More objective surveys have revealed that there is a far greater diversity of opinion among scientists than the global warming crowd would like for you to believe.From the National Review:“A 2008 survey by two German scientists, Dennis Bray and Hans von Storch, found that a significant number of scientists were skeptical of the ability of existing global climate models to accurately predict global temperatures, precipitation, sea-level changes, or extreme weather events even over a decade; they were far more skeptical as the time horizon increased.”Other mainstream news sources besides the National Review have also been courageous enough to speak out against the global warming propaganda – even the Wall Street Journal published an op-ed piece in 2015 challenging the Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) pseudoscience being promulgated by global warming proponents.And, of course, there are the more than 31,000 American scientists (to date) who have signed a petition challenging the climate change narrative and 9,029 of them hold PhDs in their respective fields. But hey, Al Gore and his cronies have also ignored that inconvenient truth, as well.Many of those scientists who signed the petition were likely encouraged to speak out in favor of the truth after retired senior NASA atmospheric scientist John L. Casey revealed that solar cycles are largely responsible for warming periods on Earth – not human activity.Al Gore and cronies continue getting richer from the global warming hoaxBut the global warming crowd continues to push their agenda on the public while lining their pockets in the process. If you’re still inclined to believe what Al Gore has to say about global warming, please consider the fact that since he embarked on his crusade, his wealth has grown from $2 million in 2001 to $100 million in 2016 – largely due to investments in fake “green tech” companies and the effective embezzlement of numerous grants and loans.You might want to take all of this information into serious consideration before casting your vote in the November election.","Your future, and the future of your children, may very well depend on it."

The actor, the president, and climate scientist Dr. Katharine Hayhoe took the stage towards the end of the evening for a conversation on climate change before the U.S. premiere of DiCaprio’s new documentary on the subject, Before the Flood.The subject of Mars and SpaceX came up while Hayhoe was talking about the need to make people connect with the reality of climate change on a universal, human level. “The most important thing to do is not to pile up scientific reports until they reach a tottering pile of about 8 feet where they tip over and crush somebody,” Hayhoe said, explaining that what really matters when trying to motivate people to combat climate change thing is to connect its real meaning and impact to “what’s in our hearts.”“The reality of it is, if you’re a human living on this planet — which most of us are, yeah?” she joked. “As long as we haven’t signed up for the trip to Mars.

Maybe, just maybe, he figured the only place tougher than frozen uncharted western territories is the Martian surface. The Academy would love it.It’s probably method acting, is what we’re saying.Earlier in the night, Obama made a Star Trek reference while talking about the importance of flawed but useful energy sources like fracking and nuclear power. “Until we invent the perfect energy source — Lithium crystals or whatever, Scotty’s there beaming us up — but until then we need to live in the real world,” Obama said.","“There are still a bunch of issues we’ve got to solve. We can’t just flip a switch and suddenly we’re where we want to be.”The event also featured a video message from actor and environmentalist Arnold Schwarzenegger, who offered some encouraging words on the importance of taking action on climate change. “We have the technology, we have the knowledge, we have the willpower, and we have the people to make a difference,” Schwarzenegger said. “We just need to do it.”"

politifact15505,1,0,"Hillary Clinton’s State Department gifted an “unknown number” of children to human traffickers after refusing to run the most basic checks on these so-called “caregivers,” according to a bombshell Senate report released late on Thursday and completely covered up by mainstream media.These children were then sexually abused, starved, and forced into child labor, according to the Senate report. Disturbingly, the fate of many of these children, mostly migrants, remains unknown.NY Mag reports: Local law enforcement uncovered the operation last year, prompting the Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations to open an inquiry into the federal government’s handling of migrants.“It is intolerable that human trafficking — modern-day slavery — could occur in our own backyard,” Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio and the chairman of the subcommittee, told the New York Times. “But what makes the Marion cases even more alarming is that a U.S. government agency was responsible for delivering some of the victims into the hands of their abusers.”As detention centers became incapable of housing the massive influx of migrants, the Department of Health and Human Services started placing children into the care of sponsors who would oversee the minors until their bids for refugee status could be reviewed. But in many cases, officials failed to confirm whether the adults volunteering for this task were actually relatives or good Samaritans — and not unscrupulous egg farmers or child molesters.The department performed check-in visits at caretakers’ homes in only 5 percent of cases between 2013 and 2015, according to the report.The Senate’s investigation built on an Associated Press report that found more than two dozen unaccompanied children were placed in homes where they were sexually abused, starved, or forced into slave labor. HHS claimed that it lacked the funds and authorities that a more rigorous screening process would have required.However, the investigation also found that HHS did not spend all of the money allocated to it for handling the crisis.The agency placed 90,000 migrant children into sponsor care between 2013 and 2015.

The federal government has previously granted certain businesses, including the National Football League (NFL), tax-exempt status under section 401(c)(3) of the tax code due to their designation as non-profit organizations. However, on Sunday evening, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that removed the NFL's non-profit status, citing the league's failure to address the disrespectful behavior of its players towards the national anthem, flag, and country. The order reclassifies the NFL as a for-profit entity for tax purposes for the 2017 fiscal year, but allows the league to reapply for tax-exempt status in January 2018 if the issues are resolved. The White House has expressed hope that all players who protest the police and flag or spread hate will be fired and replaced with individuals who love and respect America.

politifact14700,1,0,"Congresswoman Maxine Waters has reignited her political career as one of the most outspoken leaders of the Trump “Resistance.” She regularly and often beats the drum of impeachment for the president. However, in August of 2010, it was Waters who was under legal scrutiny for her behavior as a government official. Waters was charged with three counts of violating House rules and the federal ethics code.According to The Hill’s report from 2010:The House ethics committee on Monday outlined its charges against Rep. Maxine Waters, who is accused of helping a bank in which her husband owned stock secure federal bailout funds. The committee charged the 10-term California Democrat with three counts of violating House rules and the federal ethics code in connection with her effort to arrange a 2008 meeting between Treasury officials and representatives with OneUnited bank. The panel said Waters, who sits on the Financial Services Committee, broke a House rule requiring members to behave in a way that reflects “creditably” on the chamber. The committee said that by trying to assist OneUnited, she stood to benefit directly, because her husband owned a sizable amount of stock that would have been “worthless” if the bank failed. The committee also accused Waters of violating the “spirit” of a House rule prohibiting lawmakers from using their positions for financial gain, as well as a government ethics statute banning the dispensing of “special favors.”The charges were delayed and stalled by members of the committee, and multiple attorneys in the case were fired. Ultimately, Waters was absolved of the charges.According to National Review:[Waters] walked away with a slap on the wrist from the toothless House Ethics Committee in 2012 after being charged with multiple ethics violations related to her meddling in minority-owned OneUnited Bank … As stockholders, they profited handsomely from their relationship with the bank. It was a mutually beneficial relationship. After Waters’s office personally intervened and lobbied the Treasury Department in 2008, OneUnited received $12 million in federal TARP bailout money — despite another government agency concluding that the bank operated “without effective underwriting standards” and engaged “in speculative investment practices. After the federal bailout of Fannie/Freddie, OneUnited’s stock in the government-sponsored enterprises plunged to a value estimated at less than $5 million. Only through Waters’s intervention was OneUnited able to secure an emergency meeting with the Treasury and then-Secretary Henry Paulson. Tom Fitton, Judicial Watch president, reported that Waters’s friend and fellow California Democratic congresswoman Zoe Lofgren helped delay Waters’s scheduled 2010 House ethics trial on the matter by stalling subpoenas and improperly firing two attorneys working on the investigation. Six of ten House Ethics panel members quit the case in 2012 over questions about their partiality. An outside investigator absolved Waters of any wrongdoing. In spite of getting off on the charges, Waters carries with her a terrible reputation for corruption. Please see this list for a rundown of all the numerous scandals and charges which have been brought against her. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington has listed her as one of the most corrupt members of Congress five times. Resist.","(Given passage) Paraphrase please. 

A veteran congresswoman, Maxine Waters, has regained her political momentum as a prominent figure in the anti-Trump movement. She has repeatedly called for the president's impeachment. However, in 2010, Waters faced allegations of unethical behavior while serving as a government official. She was charged with three violations of House rules and the federal ethics code for attempting to help a bank, in which her husband owned stock, secure federal bailout funds. The House ethics committee claimed that Waters' actions were motivated by personal gain, as her husband's stock would have been worthless if the bank failed. The committee also accused her of violating the spirit of a House rule prohibiting lawmakers from using their positions for financial gain and a government ethics statute banning the dispensing of special favors. The case was marred by delays and controversy, with multiple attorneys being fired, but Waters was ultimately cleared of the charges. Despite this, her reputation for corruption has persisted, with her being named one of the most corrupt members of Congress five times by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington."

More recently, Melania Trump has had a more public profile. On April 24, she and the President hosted the first official state dinner of the Trump administration, an event that was planned and executed primarily by the first lady.Trump was responsible for every aspect of the formal dinner in honor of French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte Macron, from the hand-selected ivory tablecloths to the menu, which the first lady designed to meld American food with French influence. During the welcome ceremony leading up to the dinner, Melania Trump stole headlines, wearing a crisp white Michael Kors Collection suit with a matching white hat, custom-made by her personal couturier. The hat set the internet ablaze, with references and comparisons to Beyoncé, the suffragette movement and even television character Olivia Pope of ""Scandal.""On May 7, Trump, a relatively private first lady by comparison to her most recent predecessors, was once again front and center, this time to unveil her formal platform, Be Best .

The latter caused a firestorm of controversy because it encompasses cyberbullying, a tactic that Melania Trump's husband, the President, has often been accused of fueling.

politifact14840,1,1,"The FDA has published conclusive proof on their website that the DTap vaccine can cause autism.According to the FDA’s online Biologics Blood Vaccines document, a vaccine manufacturer admits on its package insert that their vaccination can cause autism as one of many adverse reactions.These adverse events reported during post-approval use of Tripedia vaccine include idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, SIDS, anaphylactic reaction, cellulitis, autism, convulsion/grand mal convulsion, encephalopathy, hypotonia, neuropathy, somnolence and apnea. Events were included in this list because of the seriousness or frequency of reporting. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequencies or to establish a causal relationship to components of Tripedia vaccine.In this sense, it should be noted that:Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Concentrates (For Further Manufacturing Use) are produced by The Research Foundation for Microbial Diseases of Osaka University (BIKEN), Osaka, Japan, under United States (US) license, and are combined with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur Inc. Tripedia vaccine is filled, labeled, packaged, and released by Sanofi Pasteur Inc.What’s in Tripedia that probably can interfere with brain chemistry and neurology?According to the Tripedia’s package insert, some ingredients include: Bovine extract, formaldehyde used to inactivate microorganisms a couple of times, ammonium sulfate, aluminum potassium sulfate and two growth mediums: modified Mueller and Miller is one; the other is Stainer-Scholte medium.What is the content of these two growth mediums?Mueller and Miller medium, contains:Glucose, sodium chloride, sodium phosphate dibasic, monopotassium, phosphate, magnesium sulfate hydrate, ferrous sulfate heptahydrate, cysteine hydrochloride, tyrosine hydrochloride, uracil hydrochloride, Ca-pantothenate in ethanol, thiamine in ethanol, pyridoxine-hydrochloride in ethanol, riboflavin in ethanol, biotin in ethanol, sodium hydroxide, beef heart infusion (de- fatted beef heart and distilled water), casein [milk protein] solution. Basically a mixture of sugar, salt, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals.While Stainer-Scholte medium has the following ingredients:Tris hydrochloride, tris base, glutamate (monosodium salt) [MSG], proline, salt, monopotassium phosphate, potassium chloride, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, ferrous sulfate, ascorbic acid, niacin, glutathione.The vaccine is formulated without preservatives, but contains a trace amount of thimerosal [(mercury derivative), (≤0.3 μg mercury/dose)] from the manufacturing process. Each 0.5 mL dose also contains, by assay, not more than 0.170 mg of aluminum and not more than 100 μg(0.02%) of residual formaldehyde. The vaccine contains gelatin and polysorbate 80 (Tween-80), which are used in the production of the pertussis concentrate.“Probable cause” ingredients for adverse reactions include: casein, to which some children are allergic; MSG—an excitotoxin; thimerosal-ethyl mercury; aluminum; formaldehyde; gelatin; and polysorbate 80.You might be wondering:Why some of the doctors don’t say anything about the risk of DTaP Vaccine?That is a question that many of us, still wondering! Maybe they just is just not convenient for them that we know about the risk of these vaccine.To take the vaccine debacle further, most of the mandated vaccines for infants and children, contain many of the above ingredients, which must be stopped from being injected into infants, toddlers, teens and even adults!It’s time for Congress to rescind the “Get out of Jail Free” card for vaccine makers and stop the aggressive onslaught of the Autism Spectrum Disorder that is depriving children of a fulfilling life and ruining families emotionally, financially, and physically to the point of parents divorcing because of the stresses of ASD in a family.It’s about time vaccines are publicl","ly held accountable for their damage.  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has released evidence on their website that the DTap vaccine can cause autism. According to the FDA, a vaccine manufacturer has admitted on its package insert that the vaccine can cause autism as one of many adverse reactions. These adverse reactions also include idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, SIDS, anaphylactic reaction, cellulitis, convulsion/grand mal convulsion, encephalopathy, hypotonia, neuropathy, somnolence, and apnea.

The vaccine also contains gelatin and polysorbate 80, which are used in the production of the pertussis concentrate. The ""probable cause"" ingredients for adverse reactions include casein, MSG, thimerosal-ethyl mercury, aluminum, formaldehyde, gelatin, and polysorbate 80. It is questionable why some doctors do not inform patients of the risks associated with the DTaP vaccine. Many mandated vaccines for infants and children contain similar ingredients, which should be stopped from being injected into children, according to the author. The article concludes by calling for vaccines to be held accountable for their damage and for Congress to rescind the ""Get out of Jail Free"" card for vaccine makers."

This fake dossier was then passed to James Comey at the FBI, who then issued FISA warrants to surveillance Donald Trump at the Trump Tower prior to the election, which later sparked Robert Mueller’s Special Counsel to investigate any Russian collusion in the 2016 Presidential Election. This, in a nutshell, exposes the spying and the treason that the DNC committed under the Obama administration to try to prevent Trump from succeeding, which is all stated in the Nunes Memo.Denzel affirmed, “If the Democrats had won the election, we never would have found out they were using false documents to get warrants to spy on American citizens and political opponents. We never would have known this. Think about it!”Denzel Washington, who has been nominated for Best Actor for the film ‘Roman J. Israel, Esq.’ (his 8th total Oscar nomination), didn’t pull any punches on the revelations of the released memo, stating: “They would have a tool they would use over and over again to circumvent the will of the people in future elections”.When a reporter then asked Denzel Washington if he felt the memo released by Congress on Friday was “reliable”, he responded, “Hell yeah, it’s reliable. We don’t need to know the nitty gritty to understand exactly what’s happened here”.“We know that a warrant to spy on the Trump team was issued based on media reports, and these media reports were based on information provided by an opposition research firm being paid by the DNC and Hillary Clinton.”“You guys can’t see what is wrong with this?

I get it. I know a lot of people who hate Trump with a real passion. But you’ve got to understand that we dodged a bullet when Clinton lost. More than one bullet. We avoided the creation of an Orwellian Police State”.We couldn’t agree more, and we thank god for Donald Trump every day, which has been our sentiment all along here at Brainstain. We also wonder why the mainstream news media is now trying to downplay the severity of the memo, as if it didn’t constitute complete treason?The double standards are “oh so” apparent, and it’s good to see somebody high up in celebrity circles like Denzel Washington to be brave enough speak out on these pressing issues, and helping to expose the scandals of the Democrat Party.",Please paraphrase the 'passage' without generating any other word.

Anthony Bourdain, a well-known chef and television personality, was found dead in an apparent suicide just weeks after he had been harassed and threatened by operatives of Hillary Clinton. Bourdain had been an outspoken critic of Harvey Weinstein and had publicly accused Clinton of being aware of Weinstein's sexual abuse for years. He had also been planning to expose pedophile rings connected to Hollywood and D.C. before his death. The suicide has raised many questions, especially since famous designer Kate Spade, who was also a Clinton Foundation member, reportedly killed herself the same week. Many people have pointed out that people who cross the Clintons tend to end up dead, mostly from suicide. The Clintons have been accused of silencing those who pose a threat to their power and influence, and the mysterious deaths of Bourdain and Spade have added fuel to these allegations."

They have called on the US government to provide evidence to prove the moon landings were not a hoax. This comes as a surprise to many, as it was previously believed that the US had successfully landed on the moon during the space race. The allegations have sparked a renewed interest in conspiracy theories surrounding the moon landings, with some suggesting that the US faked the moon landings to deceive Russia and gain an advantage in the nuclear arms race."

Not only are portions of Michigan being transformed into a “mini Baghdad,” but the state is also being overrun with rampant illegal activity, where the Muslim populace is constantly being busted in welfare fraud and disgusting mutilation practices on little girls. Now thanks to the hordes of Muslims taking over the state, Michigan can add another “accomplishment” on their list, as the Justice Department is dubbing what just went down in this state the “largest scam in United States history.”Muslims continually prove that they have little intentions into assimilating into western civilization or adhering to our nation’s laws after arriving to America from their third world countries. Our generosity to these savages is frequently repaid by insolence, as many Muslims are constantly busted at the center of welfare fraud rings, as they seek to scam the very country who has given them so much. In yet another case of blatant disregard for for our nation’s laws, a group of Muslim doctors in Detroit have just been busted as the masterminds behind a $1.3 billion dollar fraudulent scheme, leading to the arrests of 412 people overnight, in the “largest scam” that the United States Department of Justice has ever seen.The scam involves a scheme where Muslim doctors will write massive quantities of prescriptions for opioids. These drugs never land in the hands of patients however, as the Muslims will them make fraudulent claims to Medicaid and pocket the money. Additionally, the drugs often wind of on the streets as part of a huge back-alley drug operation. The U.S. Justice Department is calling this prescription drug and health care fraud scheme the largest operation of its kind in American history, naming several Michigan Muslim doctors responsible for orchestrating this huge criminal enterprise to rip off Medicare. ClickonDetroit.com has more:“Officials have made 412 arrests nationwide, including 56 doctors and targeting 200 clinics. The Justice Department said those arrested are responsible for $1.3 billion in fraudulent transactions.Federal officials said a group of Michigan doctors was responsible for a major chunk of the scheme.One of the clinics hit in the sting operations is in Farmington. Federal officials said the opioid epidemic is part of it, but the medical office and a number of others were set up specifically as a criminal enterprise to rip off Medicare.Federal officers raided the Fisher Building Wednesday, and U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said their work accounted for 10 percent of the scam’s value.‘Six doctors in Michigan prescribed patients with unnecessary opioids, some of which ended up for sale on the streets,’ Sessions said.A physician group called Global Quality used to operate out of a Woodward Avenue office building.”The ring leader of the massive Medicare scam is Muslim Mashiyat Rashid, who profited with an astounding $164 million from the fraud. He had had no qualms about rubbing the American taxpayers’ noses in what he stole from them, frequently bragging about his large piles of cash on social media. Here’s an image he posted on Facebook where he poses beside his Bentely sedan and corporate jet…all bought and paid for with the Medicare money he scammed from the American taxpayer.Other nauseating pictures show Rashid standing at the NBA finals with his court-side tickets, enjoying a life of opulence he enjoyed while screwing over the American people. Rashid’s name is included in court documents as Feds prepare their case for trial, where Muslim doctors Joseph Betro, Spilios Pappas, Abdul Haq, Tariz Omar and Mohammad Zahoor were busted working directly with Rashid in recent years to make their millions.More than 400 others across the country were charged late last week for taking part in the health care scam in connection with a raid last week at the Fisher Building in De","troit. Of the 412 charged, 56 were doctors.The investigation, led by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Detroit, began last year and targeted health care fraud and illegal opioid distribution.The ring is believed to have been in operation since 2013, with Rashid leading the charge.The Department of Justice says that this case is just one of many to come.According to a news release, the case was brought as part of the Medicare Fraud Strike Force, which is supervised by the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Michigan. This ongoing effort is a part of the Health Care Fraud Prevention and Enforcement Action Team (HEAT) and the Affordable Care Act.The Justice Department said that this takedown represents the largest-ever health care fraud enforcement action by the Medicare Fraud Strike Force, and it was largely successful thanks to the help of the FBI, HHS-OIG and DEA, who worked alongside federal and state law enforcement agencies.Federal officials said that this case is a prime example of the Trump administration’s efforts to combat the opioid crisis and health care fraud, and they promise to continue bringing criminals to justice who are lining their pockets with taxpayer dollars at the expense of innocent people.The case will be tried in a federal court in Detroit, where the culprits will be given a fair trial, after which they will face the consequences of their crimes.

There is only so much we can downsize by moving to a tiny home, so planning for storage space is an integral part of preparation for tiny living.VerticalityTiny houses for sale in Florida have tiny floor plans. There is only so much space to put things on the floor, and once bare necessities such as beds, kitchen elements etc. are taken care of, there is little space left to put all of our stuff. Verticality is key in these situations. Wall-mounted shelving is excellent for organizing your stuff and it doesn’t demand a single inch of your floor. They are also quite inexpensive and easy to install. Instead of having an entertainment center, it is now easy to mount your TV and speakers on the wall, leaving more space for things you can’t compromise with.Multi-functional FurnitureIn a tiny house, a bed doesn’t have the luxury to be just a bed. It needs to perform multiple functions, where storage is one of the most important ones. The same applies to coffee and night tables, sofas and kitchen elements. Beds can have drawers for your linens, or room for storage under their mattress. Instead of a regular coffee table, opt in for a cube design, where multiple storage drawers are integrated for all those small things you don’t have space for.Customized FurnitureSometimes it is difficult to furnish a tiny home, especially if it doesn’t use a standard floor plan. Customized furniture is a huge advantage in tiny homes, where space is at a premium. You can make sure that every single corner and nook of your house can be used in a functional way. The same applies to storage. A well-placed shelf or locker, can perform a very important function while not taking up much space or by utilizing and otherwise unused space. Customized furniture does come at a premium price, but it is one of those investments you will not lose any sleep over once you are living in your tiny home.Tiny AppliancesEvery piece of furniture and appliance you put into your tiny home, will make you compromise on something else. Tiny living is about downsizing your living space to bare necessities but that has a different meaning for different people. In order to create more space for storing stuff you can’t live without, making some sacrifices when it comes to appliances is important. Instead of a full-sized stove, opt in for a dual heat-plate design that will take up less space. A small refrigerator works fine, just like a large two-door model. Also shopping more frequently for fresh groceries will lead you to a healthier lifestyle and diet. A fold out dinning-table in the kitchen, saves you the space that you might need for a dining table. Tiny appliances and gadgets do tend to have a higher price than standard ones, but they provide so much more than function to tiny home dwellers.","Please paraphrase the 'passage' in your own words, without adding or removing any words."

President Trump had warned of what was coming to prevent these deaths and now it’s time to take urgent action as he’s announced in a shocking message to Americans.With all the focus recently being on Chicago and the immense amount of shooting deaths there are in that war zone every day, a bigger issue has presented itself just a couple states away in Ohio. The Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner has confirmed that 60 people died in February from the same alarming cause, which brings the total deaths from this to 109 this year for just this one small part of Ohio. However, the issue is widespread across the country and only getting worse, which is why Donald Trump wants to do something about it now.Fatal drug overdoses now surpass car deaths in America thanks to the increased use, availability, and abuse of heroin, fentanyl or a combination of the two that come into the country from wide open borders and unchecked immigrants. With each month comes a new record number of deaths from this drug not just in Ohio, but nationwide.“February’s number could increase because seven cases are still awaiting further toxicology testing. Of the fatalities last month, 36 were Cleveland residents,” Fox 8 reported. Trump is well aware of the opioid epidemic that claimed 52,000 lives in 2015, which was the most amount of overdoses in a single year in U.S. History. This is part of the reason he’s wanting to crack down so hard on the border.During his joint address to Congress on Tuesday, the President said that he will build “a great, great wall along our southern border” — in part to dramatically slow the flow of narcotics pouring into the U.S. at an “unprecedented rate.” “Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately stop,” Trump promised in his speech, Vox reported. Although a wall won’t stop it completely, he’s the first to address the epidemic that’s gotten worse while it was ignored the last eight years.While Trump was criticized for his comment that the wall would stop the flow of drugs, it’s a step in the right direction and he’s at least ready to do something about it, whereas his predecessor was not.

She has also tweeted that entitlement, particularly among white boys, is to blame for school shootings.

Griffin snapped at him by asking how he sleeps at night. Gidley replied that he sleeps well and said thanks. Then it seems like she said something else, and he asked if they were going to go at it right there on the spot, and that’s when Griffin went into the full nasty mode and talked with a repulsive next few words that had people questioning her behavior and gender at the same time.Here’s what happened in full detail courtesy of the Washington Blade: “The event is a celebration of the First Amendment. As a longtime LGBT rights advocate, a comedian and provocateur, Griffin has made a long and successful career out of exercising her First Amendment right to free speech. The stunt last year in which she posed with a mock severed head of Donald Trump — which needlessly led CNN to fire her from a longstanding New Year’s Eve hosting gig with Anderson Cooper — was a textbook case of satire, which is constitutionally protected speech.Thus, the decision to invite Griffin proved an easy and obvious one. (We also invited Stormy Daniels, but her attorney, Michael Avenatti, told me without irony that it would be too much of a “sideshow” for her to attend.)Trending: Sarah Sanders Just Revealed What She Asked God For After Being Publicly Humiliated At WH DinnerGriffin didn’t disappoint, bringing her quick wit and fearless, LGBT-centric sense of humor to the dinner table. I met her and her boyfriend, Randy Bick, on the red carpet and held her purse as she posed for photographers and granted a series of TV interviews. Inside the heavy purse was a stapler; it turns out she suffered a last-minute wardrobe malfunction leaving the hotel, breaking a strap on her gown. After it was repaired, she feared a repeat and asked to borrow the stapler, just in case.She proved a good sport throughout the night, posing for an endless stream of selfies with (mostly gay) fans who congratulated her on surviving the Trump machine’s attacks in the aftermath of the photo scandal. When asked how her famous mom Maggie is at age 96, Griffin replied, “drunk.”The only awkward moment came when Deputy White House Press Secretary Hogan Gidley tried to squeeze past our table. Griffin stopped him and said, “How do you sleep at night?” Gidley replied, “Very well, thank you.” When Griffin expressed doubt about that, Gidley asked, “Are we really going to do this?”That’s when things got interesting. Griffin, in her trademark style, retorted, “Yes we are, suck my d-ck! No, really, suck my d-ck!”There was some back-and-forth, then Gidley, who was holding a Tecate, announced he was off to enjoy his Mexican beer “before we build the wall and you can’t get these anymore.” That prompted a farewell “f-ck you” from Griffin, triggering nervous laughter around our table.”It sure sounds like they had a fun time exchanging comments before Kathy Griffin took it to the levels of a unprofessionalism, acting exactly like the person who couldn’t hold a job with the Squatty Potty.Even though she claims to be a comedian, there’s still a level of professionalism that people should exude when they’re not on stage. Griffin has been unable to differentiate that and consistently confuses real life for her stage life (or lack thereof).Griffin might have some fans, but she","’s not exactly the most popular comedian in the world. The fact that she feels like she has to resort to such tactics to get a reaction out of people, especially when it comes to her political opinions, really shows that her career as a comedian has been failing for quite some time. This is likely why she’s been trying to shift her focus to LGBT advocacy instead.The irony here is that, despite Griffin’s crude comment, it’s actually Gidley who has been able to maintain a level of professionalism and grace under pressure. That’s probably why he’s still holding down a high-profile job in the White House while Griffin is stuck in the shadow of her former self, struggling to remain relevant in any way she can. It’s clear who the real adult in the room is here."
politifact14273,1,0,"There is not a day that goes by that we don’t hear about a Muslim terror attack taking place somewhere in our world, but that hasn’t stopped leftists from defending them at every opportunity. Those of us that criticize the so-called “religion of peace” are subjected to ridicule and even being attacked for our belief of how dangerous Muslims are. In Europe, those that speak out against Islam are being imprisoned for their belief. Courts are actually sentencing people for “Islam anti-blasphemy” laws. While this may be par for the course in Europe right now, it is not the way we roll in America, until now. Minnesota has just established a similar law.Anti-blasphemy laws are a huge victory for Muslims because it ensures their protection and in turn, allows them to continue acting in whatever manner they please all the while marching towards Sharia Law.According to Minneapolis’ local newspaper, the Star-Tribune, the hotline was set up as a way to target Trump supporters, who Muslims believe are the group of people most likely to “harass them.” The Star Tribune reported:The city of Minneapolis has set up a hotline for residents to report hate-crime incidents and other acts of intolerance.The service, operated through the city’s 311 helpline, is aimed to aid targets of any “harassing behaviors motivated by prejudice,” according to a city news release issued on Monday.The announcement comes amid signs of a recent surge of such incidents affecting Muslims and Jews across the country, many of which go unreported.“Since the general election, many of us have experienced, witnessed firsthand or heard of actions of: racism, xenophobia, sexism and bigotry directed at people here and in cities across the United States,” Minneapolis Department of Civil Rights Director Velma Korbel wrote in a statement posted on the city’s website. “In no uncertain terms, hate-motivated speech and actions have no place in Minneapolis nor will they be tolerated.”The city’s Department of Civil rights along with mayor is leading the charge for this government-enforced fascism, as this new hotline will now encourage citizens to turn in their neighbors for holding opinions deemed forbidden by the state. This hotline flies right in the face of our United States Constitution, where it goes to the heart of denying American citizens their inalienable rights of the First Amendment, which governments CAN NOT DO. Of course, the rabid liberals controlling the city have little regard for the Constitution or the rights of Americans, as they are using their position to establish a soft version of anti-blasphemy laws. “In no uncertain terms, hate-motivated speech and actions have no place in Minneapolis nor will they be tolerated,” Minneapolis Department of Civil Rights Director Velma Korbel wrote in a statement posted on the city’s website.The Department echoes the unconstitutional sentiments of Minneapolis’ mayor, Betsy Hodges, who went on to blast President Trump, pushing her insane narrative of there being an epidemic of bigotry and hate in our country since he got into office. She stated: “I will not compromise the public safety of the people of Minneapolis to satisfy Trump’s desire to put politics before public safety. Minneapolis is being built and strengthened by people from all over the world and I am grateful for their commitment to our city. I stand with them today and will continue to take that stand as the President-elect prepares to take office.” The idea of an anti-blasphemy hotline in America is pretty absurd, but right up liberal’s alley. Why are they so willing to protect those that would seek to hurt us, don’t they want to protect their loved ones? This is only the beginning of the Democrats plans to take control of our country again, but what they don’t realize is that everyone will end up suffering if we continue to bow to Muslim’s demands. This “anti-blasphemy” hotline is just the start and will only get worse if we allow it. It is very similar to Nazi Ger","ma 
(2017)The rise of terrorist attacks by Muslims has led to increased scrutiny of the religion and its followers, but some on the left continue to defend Islam and criticize those who express concerns about its teachings. In some parts of the world, including Europe, individuals who speak out against Islam face imprisonment, and courts have established ""Islam anti-blasphemy"" laws. Minnesota has recently set up a similar hotline, aimed at reporting hate crimes and intolerance, which some see as a victory for Muslims and a step towards implementing Sharia law. The hotline has been met with criticism, as it is seen as an attack on the First Amendment rights of American citizens, and a form of government-enforced fascism. The mayor of Minneapolis and the city's Department of Civil Rights have been vocal in their support for the hotline, citing a surge in hate crimes against Muslims and Jews since the recent presidential election. However, some argue that the hotline is a form of censorship and a violation of the Constitution, and that it will only lead to more restrictions on free speech and the further marginalization of certain groups."

He claims he committed 37 assassinations for the American government between 1959 and 1972, including the actress and model, Marilyn Monroe. Hodges says he has no regrets.In amongst his many confessions, he admits to being a group member of five CIA agents, whose sole task was to carry out assassinations. He also admits one of his assassinations being none other than Glamour icon, Marilyn Monroe, who was killed not just because of her ties with John F Kennedy, but also because she slept with Fidel Castro, ultimately making her a massive national security risk.Hodges says he has no regrets.He claims he carried out 37 assassinations for the US Government between 1959 and 1972 including Marilyn Monroe.Hodges had worked for the CIA.Hodges was a CIA officer for 41 years working as an operative amongst top level security clearances, he claims he was employed as a hit-man by the organization, his duty was to assassinate individuals who posed a threat to the security of the United States of America.He was trained as a sniper and a martial arts expert but also trained in other methods ranging from taking people out with poisons to using explosives.Despite his old age, Hodges has managed to recall each of the assassinations he committed for the CIA. He goes on to admit that the murders were carried out on American soil and by the orders of his then commanding officer, Major James “Jimmy” Hayworth.He also claims the timeline for the assassinations were between August 1959 and March 1972, when the “the CIA had its own agenda”. Furthermore, he admits that he was part of an operation team of five members, who were taking orders to carry out the assassinations. Their victims were from all walks of life ranging from journalists, union leaders, political activists, artists, and scientists – all of which were killed because their radical ideas posed a threat to the interests of the United States.Hodges admits that Marilyn Monroe was the only woman he had ever assassinated, a unique target at the time. He claims she had become a significant “threat to the security of the country” and had to be eliminated.“We had evidence that Marilyn Monroe had not only slept with Kennedy but also with Fidel Castro”, says M. Hodges. “My commanding officer, Jimmy Hayworth, told me that she had to die and that it had to look like a suicide or an overdose. I had never killed a woman before, but I obeyed orders… I did it for America! She could have transmitted strategic information to the communists, and we couldn’t allow that! She had to die! I just did what I had to do!”Marilyn Monroe died on the 5th of August 1962. Hodges claims he entered her room while the star was sleeping, injecting her with a fatal dose of Chloral Hydrate (a very powerful sedative) that was also mixed with Nembutal – a short-acting barbiturate, which ultimately caused her death.The FBI is taking Hodges claims very seriously and has now placed him under custody whilst a full investigation is opened to attempt to verify his allegations.The most important witness in the case would have been Major James Hayworth, who died of a heart attack in 2011. Two other CIA assassins who were identified by Hodges are also dead.This could open up many questions about the CIA’s activities in America in that era. What do you think? Why would Hodges say something like this if it weren’t true? Is it all conspiracy garbage? Let us know your thoughts!","Normand Hodges, a 78-year-old retired CIA officer, has made shocking confessions about his involvement in 37 assassinations, including that of Marilyn Monroe, between 1959 and 1972.

He claimed it was done as a favor to senior Iranian officials linked to President Hassan Rouhani, and he alleged the move sparked a competition among Iranian officials over whose children would benefit from the scheme.Several children of current and former Iranian officials live in the United States, including Ali Fereydoun, whose father is brother and special aide of President Hassan Rouhan, and Fatemeh Ardeshir Larijani, whose father Ali Larijani is speaker of parliament.While Zolnour did not mention any names, he obviously was trying to make a political point.“When Obama, during the negotiations about the JCPOA, decided to do a favor to these men, he granted citizenship to 2,500 Iranians and some officials started a competition over whose children could be part of these 2,500 Iranians,” he claimed. “If today these Iranians get deported from America, it will become clear who is complicit and sells the national interest like he is selling candies to America.” The conservative Zolnour, who is in Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s inner circle, added: “It should be stated exactly which children of which authorities live in the United States and have received citizenship or residency.”He said while some were studying in the U.S. others were working in the U.S. “against our national interests.”It’s not clear who he’s talking about and whether he’s confusing a green card with citizenship. And one has to take his political objective into account.But it obviously raises a concerning question.There have been so many things hidden from the public about the Iran Deal if this was one more thing given up in bribe, it wouldn’t be hard to believe.And it shouldn’t be hard to track this down with a little government and Congressional investigation.The problem, of course, too many Obama holdovers in places like the State Department so you can’t get a straight answer.Asked about the cleric’s claim, a State Department spokesperson said: “We’re not going to comment on every statement by an Iranian official.” Fox News analyst and former Obama State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf was dubious of the Iranian official’s allegation. “This sounds like totally made up BS,” she said. The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment. A representative for Obama Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson also could not be reached for comment.This would certainly anger Republicans, especially in the wake of the pallets of cash, sanctions relief and giving access to the U.S. financial system that has already been revealed about the deal.And in Iran, they could fuel resentment toward Tehran’s elite. “Many ordinary Iranians are surprised and feel betrayed that children of the regime officials live and work in the U.S.,” Saeed Ghasseminejad, a research fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based research institute, told Fox News. “The regime officials chant death to America but send their children to the U.S., away from the hell they have created in Iran over the past four decades.” Ghasseminejad said some Iranians have called for their deportation from America: “Iranians don’t understand why the U.S. government allows the offspring of the regime officials to live in the U.S., while the U.S. has introduced a travel ban for ordinary Iranian citizens and many Americans are imprisoned in Iran.

In the video, the rapper shoots a clown version of President Trump with a toy gun, but that’s not what got him in trouble.After the story went viral, a reporter from Breitbart caught up with Snoop Dogg and asked him if he believed violence was the answer. His response was chilling. He said:“No, man. I don’t like violence any more than the next guy, but I would hope that if this clown in the White House was about to start a war or somethin’ that someone would do what I did but with a real gun. I know I would and I would encourage anyone who could get close enough to do the same. That’s not violence…it’s survival of the species.”The reporter, Glen Dingusman, immediately contacted the Secret Service with his evidence of violent threats made against the president and Snoop Dogg, who was on his way into a restaurant for lunch when the exchange happened, never made it past his hot wing appetizer.According to the agency, he will be held as a military combatant without being charged until they can ascertain whether or not he’s a threat to the president.

Snoop Dogg stated that while he doesn't condone violence, he would encourage anyone who could get close enough to the president to do the same thing he did in the video, but with a real gun, in order to prevent the president from starting a war. The Secret Service has taken Snoop Dogg into custody and will hold him as a military combatant without charging him until they can determine whether or not he poses a threat to the president.

politifact15579,1,1,"The Second Amendment has continuously been under assault in the United States and in the United Nations. Most often, the attacks came from Democrats and other leftists who have long wanted to see a disarmed populace, with only the government and military maintaining access to firearms. Liberals know that an armed population will not willingly become slaves.The United Nations has long worked, on an international level, to undermine the right of individuals to keep and bear arms, particularly the right of Americans to do so. In a recent document, it sounds like representatives of the United States promised “full implementation” of the UN’s gun-control agreement, and in doing so essentially forfeit the Second and Tenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Perhaps most interestingly of all, the mainstream media has been entirely silent on the issue… perhaps they don’t want to laud this win and stir up patriots?The Third Review Conference for the UN’s Programme of Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons concluded at the end of June. Apparently, American ‘representatives’ at the conference agreed to begin developing ‘legal frameworks’ (generally, laws and regulations) that will enforce “proper management” of “small arms and light weapons” stockpiles.It seems that this agreement also includes ‘stockpiles’ owned by American citizens.The United Nations, an extremely corrupt international government organization with a long track record of failure and few (if any) successes to its name, is hoping that the United States will help it to track (and likely, confiscate) firearms in the country.The conference put out a plan that included demands for a massive database of all organizations, parties, and individuals that manufacture, own, sell, trade, or transfer firearms or ammunition.This will serve as a means for the United Nations to find ‘illicit’ ammunition and firearms.Of course, given the UN’s history of pushing for gun control measures, it’s not beyond the pale to believe that the organization would declare wide swaths of firearms illegal, or that home manufacture of ammunition for private use or resale is illegal.If the United States passes a law, or an executive order, to compel it to cooperate with the UN’s gun control objectives, that could mean that the government would actually seize such equipment on behalf of the international agency.However, it gets worse still. The ‘Programme of Action’ also allows UN ‘peacekeepers’ to go to member nations to ‘assist’ in meeting the goals of the program.So, if the organization decides that the United States should hand over its civilian-owned AR-15s for destruction, and then decides that the process is taking too long, they could send their blue helmet and beret-wearing goons to American shores to ‘help’ speed the process up.The conference produced a list of six points to which all member states agreed.Firstly, they all agreed to establish laws in their nations to support the effective implementation of the Programme of Action (PoA).Secondly, they agreed to strengthen ‘coordinated approaches’ nationally for implementing the PoA.Thirdly, they promised to include women in the mechanism related to said implementation.Fourth, the representatives agreed to create a ‘national point of contact’ to act in the role of liaison between nations and the UN.Fifth, they promised to ‘make better use’ of existing data to push various social and corporate policies in order to be ‘in compliance’ with UN demands concerning women, disarmament, and ‘non-proliferation,’ which generally means not making new firearms for the civilian market.Finally, they agreed to ‘significantly reduce’ illicit flows of small arms through means such as ‘voluntary surrender’ programmes and ‘illicit weapons’ recovery.In other words, the United States government is expected to help push an absurdly anti-Second Amendment set of demands on the American people.If they don’t push that set of rules upon the people swiftly enough, the","United Nations might just send over some troops to help them along.
A journalist rephrased the given passage:
The Second Amendment has been consistently challenged in the United States and the United Nations, primarily by Democrats and leftists who desire a disarmed population. The liberal elites understand that an armed population will not easily submit to authoritarian rule. The United Nations has been working to undermine the individual right to bear arms on a global scale, particularly targeting American citizens' right to do so. Recently, U.S. representatives agreed to fully implement the UN's gun-control agreement, effectively surrendering the Second and Tenth Amendments. The mainstream media has been eerily silent on the issue, perhaps to avoid stirring up patriotic opposition. At the Third Review Conference for the UN's Programme of Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons, American representatives agreed to develop legal frameworks to enforce the proper management of small arms and light weapons owned by civilians. The corrupt United Nations, with a history of pushing for gun control, may use this agreement to track and confiscate firearms in the United States. The conference's plan includes creating a massive database of organizations, parties, and individuals involved in the manufacture, sale, trade, or transfer of firearms or ammunition. This would allow the UN to target 'illicit' ammunition and firearms. If the U.S. government passes a law or executive order to cooperate with the UN's gun control objectives, it could lead to the seizure of such equipment on behalf of the international agency. Moreover, the UN may send 'peacekeepers' to member nations, including the United States, to assist in achieving the Programme of Action's goals. The conference produced six points agreed upon by all member states, including establishing laws to support the Programme of Action, strengthening coordinated approaches for implementation, creating a national point of contact for liaison between nations and the UN, and making better use of existing data to push social and corporate policies aligning with UN demands. The U.S. government is expected to promote an anti-Second Amendment agenda, and if they don't comply swiftly enough, the UN might send troops to help them along."

politifact14745,1,1,"Read original article hereLiberals sure are afraid of Roy Moore. Not only did they push a woman in front of the cameras to cry and lie about some stuff that allegedly happened 35 years ago she’s just now remembering to mention (we refuse to repeat the salacious allegations because they are 100% verifiable fake news) but when the fake 14-year-old didn’t work for them, the Democrat Party did something even worse: they doubled down on the story, introduced a new actress, and had her tell an even more horrible lie.Fiona Dourif says she was 11 years old when Moore “groped her in the alley behind the” church they both attended in 1957. “It was the most horrifying moment of my life,” she told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow on Friday night. She then described the series of events that allegedly happened, including the obviously false allegation that he baited her into the alley with candy. “Roy Moore definitely did all of those things and more,” she said looking into the camera, dry-eyed.Maddow then interviewed Dourif’s parents, who said that they knew of the alleged abuse but didn’t say anything until he was running for Senator because they “feared for their lives.” Of course, if that was the case they would not have waited until he had more political power and wealth than he did when this allegedly happened.One piece of information Dourif failed to mention is that she is currently employed as a housekeeper for Michelle Obama at the D.C. mansion “she” and her “husband” Barack share. This information was uncovered by Gateway Pundit’s Charles C. Johnson, who notes in his report that “Dourif is paid extremely well according to public documents, which report a $250,783.33 annual salary for Dourif.”“Why would Barack and Michelle Obama’s housekeeper suddenly remember that she was molested by someone who is running for public office – someone of the opposing party,” Johnson writes. “This stinks more than Malia Obama’s dorm room after one of her reefer parties.”What exactly is going on? Ever since it her employer was revealed, Dourif has gone dark, removing all of her social media presences and refusing to respond to interview requests from any source.","The mainstream media is in a frenzy trying to protect their new star witness, but it’s clear that there is something seriously wrong with this woman’s story. Why would a woman who claims to have been abused by a man 35 years ago suddenly come forward with these allegations when he is running for public office? What kind of person would use such a heinous crime for political gain? And why would the Obamas' housekeeper, of all people, be the one to come forward with this information?The answers to these questions are clear: the Democrats are desperate to take down Roy Moore, and they are willing to do whatever it takes to make that happen – even if it means lying, manipulating, and exploiting a woman’s painful past for their own political gain. They are truly disgusting."
politifact15123,1,0,"EspañolThe current influenza season has been especially difficult, causing widespread illness that has affected all fifty states and resulted in a record number of hospitalizations. While healthcare professionals continue to combat this year’s flu – which may continue to affect Americans into April – we’re already partnering with other public health agencies to conduct essential work to produce next season’s influenza vaccines.As part of this process, we’re striving to better understand why we saw reduced effectiveness of this year’s influenza vaccines against one strain of influenza A, called H3N2. It was this strain that caused much of the influenza-related illness this flu season. Moreover, this year is not the first time we have seen vaccines be less effective against this particular strain of influenza, H3N2.As such, we are taking a number of actions to better understand why effectiveness tends to be lower against the H3N2 strain and what we can do about it. By looking closely at the available data and applying the lessons we learn each flu season to the vaccine development process, we offer the greatest chance of developing vaccines that even more effectively prevent the flu in the future.These lessons may be applied not only to enhancing the most prevalent process for developing influenza vaccine in eggs, but to considering whether greater investment in alternative processes such as cell-based or recombinant approaches to vaccine development are required. With this statement, I want to outline what we’ve learned so far about this season’s vaccines and the steps we’re taking and plan to take to determine the root cause of this year’s findings and better prepare for future flu seasons.Reduced effectiveness of 2017-2018 seasonal vaccines against H3N2There are a number of theories on why this season’s vaccines produced reduced effectiveness against H3N2. We’re taking steps to investigate each of these potential causes, rule out possible reasons for the variation in effectiveness and improve vaccine efficacy against H3N2. Overall, preliminary vaccine effectiveness reported by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for H3N2 influenza was 25 percent, which means that people who received the vaccine were 25 percent less likely to be sick and need to see a doctor.While that finding isn’t too far off from the vaccine effectiveness seen against H3N2 in previous years, we need to take new steps to improve vaccine efficacy against H3N2. Of note, the effectiveness of the vaccine against H3N2 in children 6 months to 8 years of age was 51 percent this season, yet the effectiveness in those 65 years and older was only 17 percent, and the effectiveness in older children and adults under 65 years of age was even lower. The vaccines did do much better for other viruses that are also causing the flu this season. The data show that overall vaccine effectiveness for H1N1 and influenza B was 67 percent and 42 percent, respectively, for all age groups combined.So why did this season’s vaccines not deliver higher protection against H3N2? And why have vaccines in prior seasons when H3N2 circulated, also delivered reduced protection against this particular flu strain?We don’t think it was a question of getting the particular H3N2 strain wrong when we set out to produce this season’s flu vaccines. Although adapting circulating virus strains for manufacture can lead to differences between the circulating strain and the one used for manufacturing that could affect effectiveness, so far the data we have suggests that the viruses provided by reference laboratories to manufacturers to make this year’s vaccines do reasonably match the circulating flu strains that are causing most of the illnesses, including H3N2.However, we’re working with our colleagues at CDC and other federal agencies to examine and address other factors that might be contributing to the less than optimal overall protection provided by this season’s vaccines against influenz","meeting in a few months. At that meeting, the committee will hear the latest information about the circulating flu strains and make recommendations about which strains should be included in the 2018-2019 flu vaccines. We’re also working with the World Health Organization (WHO) to identify candidate vaccine viruses for inclusion in flu vaccines for the Northern and Southern Hemispheres for the upcoming season. This is a global effort to ensure that flu vaccines are effective for people around the world.Furthermore, we’re taking steps to increase public awareness about the importance of getting a flu vaccine every year. This is particularly important for people at high risk for serious flu complications, such as older adults, young children, pregnant women, and people with certain long-term health conditions. These groups should also take additional steps to prevent the spread of the flu, such as avoiding close contact with people who are sick, covering their mouth and nose when they cough or sneeze, and washing their hands frequently.While we’re working to improve the effectiveness of flu vaccines, it’s important to remember that even less effective vaccines can still prevent a significant amount of flu illness and hospitalizations. This year’s vaccines, for example, have prevented thousands of hospitalizations and hundreds of thousands of illnesses, even with the reduced effectiveness against H3N2. Furthermore, getting a flu vaccine every year is important because it can help protect vulnerable populations who may be at greater risk for serious flu complications.In conclusion, this year’s flu season has been particularly severe, and we’re taking steps to better understand why the vaccine effectiveness against one strain of the flu, H3N2, was reduced. We’re working to identify the root causes of this reduced effectiveness and to apply the knowledge we gain to improve the development of future flu vaccines. While we’re committed to developing better flu vaccines, it’s also important to remember that even less effective vaccines can still provide important protection against the flu. By getting vaccinated every year and taking other preventive measures, we can help protect ourselves, our loved ones, and vulnerable populations from the flu."
politifact15525,1,0,"It was June 2014 when the Washington Post reported that illegal immigrants, “including thousands of women and children, stream into south Texas. It was nine months late when the same paper reported that Obama’s border agents were tossing some of those kids into internment camps as an experiment.It was called the Juvenile Referral Process, and it worried human rights groups Mexican officials who feared that it put the kids at risk. The program was the creation of Robert Harris who at the time U.S. Customs and Border Protection commander of the Laredo sector. Harris believed holding certain young Mexicans, believed to be working for cartels in detention serves to get these kids out of the smuggling enterprise. Believed is the operative word, There were no judges, no charges– no trial–just belief.His intelligence analysts estimated that 78 percent of the guides smuggling other migrants were Mexicans younger than 18 — teenagers often hired or conscripted by drug cartels that knew they would not be prosecuted if caught — and he wanted to attack this loophole. “Why don’t we remove these juveniles from the smuggling cycle?” Harris, the outgoing commander of the Laredo sector of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, recalled thinking. Trending: Journalist Laura Loomer Files Assault Charges Against Maxine Waters Now, as a result of that decision, young Mexicans are being held for months without charge in shelters across the United States, sometimes without their parents’ knowledge. Since the program began in May, 536 juveniles have been held — 248 of whom have been deported to Mexico after an average stay of 75 days, according to Border Patrol statistics. Mexican authorities say some of these repeat border-crossers have spent as much as six months in U.S. custody while they await an appearance before an immigration judge. During their detention, they are questioned by U.S. authorities and then transferred to a network of facilities run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, part of the Department of Health and Human Services, across 15 states.Lets put this in perspective, under Trump children are separated from their parents because they don’t want the kids going to jail with their parents. Under Obama, young illegal immigrants were put in “facilities” so they could be squeezed for any information they may or may not have about drug cartels.“Our concern is that the program’s real intent is to interrogate the kids,” said Maureen Meyer, an expert on Mexico and migrants at the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA). The kids are “often questioned about the criminal groups they are working for and then subsequently returned to Mexico with no apparent concern about the implications for them.” While in custody last year [2014], one Mexican boy who worked as a guide shared information with U.S. authorities about the location of stash houses used by migrants as they move through the United States, according to his lawyer’s written summary of his case. When he returned to Mexico, he learned that armed men had forced their way into his home and killed a relative’s son. The men told the family that there had been raids on cartel hideouts and arrests and that they believed the boy was responsible. His half-brother was later killed by the same group. The boy, his lawyer said, has since been in hiding. Harris said the Border Patrol does not have a system to track what happens to the juveniles once they return to Mexico. The program does appear to be discouraging them from returning illegally to Texas, he said. The patrol calculates that just 7 percent of the children who have gone through the program has been picked up again crossing the border.But the program was a surprise to Mexico“The moment it started, it took us all by surprise, because there wasn’t an announcement,” said Reyna Torres Mendívil, director general of the Mexican Foreign Ministry’s office for protection of Mexicans abroad. “Where were they taking these children?”Regarding prevent","ing kids from going back to smuggling, she said, “The problem is that they’re taking them away from their families. They’re putting them in shelters. They’re interrogating them. And in some cases, they’re deporting them. But what happens to them after that? We don’t know.”""

Earth has a companion in space which has been orbiting our world for over a century, and NASA has only recently spotted it.According to new reports from NASA, there is a quasi-moon orbiting around Earth for almost a century, and we have missed it all along.The new moon isn’t as big as THE MOON is, but, it still keeps our original moon company while traveling across space.The smaller quasi-moon orbits Earth with an extremely irregular path. Moon 2.0 is actually asteroid 2016 H03, which is locked into a dance with our planet, in fact, it has been dancing with our planet for almost a century and we have failed to notice it until recently. The quasi- moon’s orbit is extremely elliptical causing it to travel between 38 and 100 times the distance of our planet’s ‘original’ moon.The ‘new’ moon is tilted at around 8° and travels around the sun for 365.93 days, which is a bit longer than our planets 365.24 day-long year.The orbit of the new moon varies a lot. In fact, due to its tilted and elliptical orbit, 2016 H03 is sometimes closer to the sun and moves faster than our planet and in other times its located farther out and moves slowly. However, researcher shave found it never gets closer to about 14 million kilometers from Earth, nor does it stray off course over 40 million kilometers.Earth new mini-moon is around 40 meters across and nearly 100 meters wide and will most likely remain as one of Earth’s smaller moon for coming centuries.The new moon was discovered thanks to the Pan-STARRS 1 asteroid survey telescope in Haleakala, Hawaii.“Since 2016 HO3 loops around our planet, but never ventures very far away as we both go around the sun, we refer to it as a quasi-satellite of Earth,” said Paul Chodas, manager of NASA’s Center for Near-Earth Object (NEO) Studies at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. “One other asteroid — 2003 YN107 — followed a similar orbital pattern for a while over ten years ago, but it has since departed our vicinity.This new asteroid is much more locked onto us. Our calculations indicate 2016 HO3 has been a stable quasi-satellite of Earth for almost a century, and it will continue to follow this pattern as Earth’s companion for centuries to come.”SourceLike this: Like Loading...","Share This: RelatedSTUNNING: NASA’s Curiosity Rover Captures AMAZING Footage Of Mount Sharp On Mars (VIDEO)Alien Life May Have Existed On Mars: NASA’s Curiosity Rover Finds Evidence Of Water On The Red PlanetNASA’s Hubble Telescope Captures Stunning Image Of Galaxy Collision [PHOTO] Leave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.

I am not certain where he is now, but in 2016, he was living quietly in his villa with five of his wives and many children.”Mr. Snowden says the CIA orchestrated the fake death of the former leader of Al Qaeda, while he was actually transported with his family to an undisclosed location in the Bahamas.“Osama Bin Laden was one of the CIA’s most efficient operatives for a long time,” claims the famous whistleblower. “What kind of message would it send their other operatives if they were to let the SEALs kill him? They organized his fake death with the collaboration of the Pakistani Secret services, and he simply abandoned his cover. Since everyone believes he is dead, nobody’s looking for him, so it was pretty easy to disappear. Without the beard and the military jacket, nobody recognizes him.”Mr. Snowden says that the documents proving that Bin Laden is still alive will be integrally reproduced in his new book, expected to be released in September.Edward Snowden was hired by an NSA contractor in 2013 after previous employment with Dell and the CIA.

During this same week last year, CNN averaged 1.191 million. That is a -29 percent collapse.CNN’s average total day viewers disintegrated by -25 percent, 841K compared to 635K.In other words, throughout the day last week, CNN could only attract an average of 635,000 total viewers.Fox News, however, is thriving. Last week, Fox averaged 2.487 million primetime viewers, nearly three times that of CNN’s 844K, and 1.463 million total day viewers, more than twice CNN’s 635K.While MSNBC is in a distant second place behind Fox, it is still leaving CNN in the dust with an average of 1.667 million primetime viewers and 913K total day viewers.Incredibly, CNN’s second week of May this year was even worse than the first week, which was already catastrophic. During week one, CNN attracted a dismal 859K primetime viewers, but that was still better than week two, which dropped even further to 844K. In total day viewers, the anti-Trump channel dipped from a ruinous week one of just 649K viewers to an even more ruinous week two of 635K.Compared to the full month of May last year, the Stormy Daniels Network is collapsing even more in the advertiser-coveted 25-54 age demo.During the full month of May 2017, CNN average 399K demo viewers during primetime. Last week that number collapsed a whopping -35 percent to just 259K. In total day, the damage was -34 percent, from 274K demo viewers to a humiliating 183K.By comparison, Fox News averaged 492K demo viewers during primetime (almost double CNN) and 296K demo viewers during the total day.MSNBC averaged 326K demo viewers during primetime and 190K during total day.The third week of May is already looking like it could be even worse for CNN. On Monday, despite the massive news surrounding the opening of the American embassy in Jerusalem, CNN averaged a dismal 643K total day viewers, compared to Fox and MSNBC’s 1.76 million and 1.13 million, respectively.During primetime Monday, CNN could only attract a scant 765K total viewers. Fox nearly quadrupled CNN with 2.89 million viewers. MSNBC more than doubled CNN with 1.93 million.The bottom line is that CNN’s ongoing and well-documented credibility crisis has now come home to roost as a five-alarm ratings crisis.",The numbers are crystal clear. CNN is in freefall and is on the verge of collapse.
politifact13942,1,0,"The government has implemented a new regulation requiring a governor to be placed on all motorcycles by mid-January 2017. The purpose of the mandatory governor would be to prevent motorcyclists from exceeding a speed of 75- miles per hour. The regulation aims to drastically reduce the amount of annual motorcycle fatalities in the United States.Many are not surprised by the regulation as politicians have been asking for stricter safety features to be implemented on motorcycles for the past several decades. In 2014, the government offered all major motorcycle manufactures including Harley-Davidson, Yamaha, Honda, Ducati, Kawasaki, Suzuki, and BMW a large tax-incentive to begin implementing governors on all newly manufactured motorcycles, however to much surprise, all relevant manufactures declined to take advantage of the additional tax-incentive, requiring government officials to return to the drawing board.Members of the U.S. Department of Transportation or U.D.O.T were supportive of the regulation and heavily involved in its roll-out. According to U.S. Department of Transportation representative James Littleton, the motorcycle governor regulation was long past due and made a comparison to the governors placed on traditional automobiles. Littleton told reporters during a press-conference that each year approximately 8,265 motorcycle fatalities occur throughout the United States. According to Littleton, the vast majority (approximately 73%) of motorcycle fatalities are the result of motorcyclists driving at unsafe speeds.When asked why the regulation would only allow motorcyclists to maintain a speed below 75-miles per hour, Littleton made the following comment to reporters, “This is a crucial safety regulation that should have been implemented at least 20-years ago, now that we are finally implementing it, we want to ensure we do it right. With the exception of a few states that allow for 80-miles per mile freeway driving (Idaho, Montana, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming) and Texas who allows for speeds of up to 85-miles per hour on the freeway, most states allow a maximum speed of 75-miles per hour. We wanted to make it easy for motorcyclists in most all states to easily obey their respective posted speed limit.”According to Littleton, motorcyclists in the few states that periodically allow for speeds exceeding 75-miles per hour, governors allowing speeds up to 80-85-miles per hour may eventually be implemented, however in the meantime, police officials in these states have been given direction to avoid citing motorcyclists for such infractions as obstructing the flow of traffic when relevant.Officials expect all motorcyclists and motorcycle manufactures to be in compliance with the new regulation by mid to late January 2017, however may file for a temporary 30, 60, or 90-day extension under select circumstances. According to Littleton, citations and fines will be imposed on both motorcyclists and motorcycle manufactures who fail to remain in compliance with the regulation.According to Littleton, designated motorcycle mechanic and auto-body shops in each state will be permitted to install the mandatory governors on motorcycles manufactured and sold prior to the implementation of the regulation at a subsidized rate. Littleton did not have details regarding the government subsidized repair readily available, however told reporters that he expects the subsidized cost to be around $35 to the consumer.Littleton concluded the press conference by informing reporters that the U.S Department of Transportation is currently working diligently to release all relevant information pertaining to the new regulation on the U.D.O.T website.",Please paraphrase the 'passage'.

Neither, according to the State Board of Elections.The true explanation is much less exciting.Prior to passage of the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) in 1993, the state did not require those registering to provide their birth date. While most voters who registered before NVRA did provide birth dates, some did not. These voters were automatically assigned a default birth date of 01/01/1900 in the state’s voter rolls.

However, the State Board of Elections clarified that these high numbers of centenarian voters were not indicative of voter fraud, but rather a result of a glitch in the voter registration system prior to the passage of the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) in 1993. Before the NVRA, voters were not required to provide their birth dates when registering, and some who did not provide their birth dates were automatically assigned a default birth date of January 1, 1900, in the state's voter rolls.

politifact15048,1,1,"It’s no surprise that one of the most hated people in the entire world is George Soros. This liberal billionaire has used his massive wealth and resources to essentially control the Democratic Party. Which is why if Hillary Clinton had won the presidential election, she would have been listening to Soros.When you’re done imaging that nightmare scenario, it’s important to realize that the fight isn’t over yet. Hillary might have lost the election, but Soros is still out there, mobilizing and planning more moves that seek to dismantle the Donald Trump presidency.That’s why Trump finally had enough and is going to charge Soros as a “threat to national security” in the United States. Considering that this is the same man that has mobilized and paid protesters to create a tremendous amount of damage, it’s been a long time coming for this order.Trump had placed a call to Russia to ask about “any and all” files that are related to Soros. He was able to do this thanks to the 2014 Executive Order that was signed by President Obama, entitled “Blocking Property of Certain Persons Contributing to the Situation in Ukraine.”“I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, find that the actions and policies of persons that undermine democratic processes and institutions in Ukraine; threaten its peace, security, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity; and contribute to the misappropriation of its assets, constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat.”Nearly a month after this order was signed US diplomatic cables show that Soros did “undermine the processes and institutions in Ukraine.” Due to Soros’s illegal intervention into a peaceful transition of power, mass conflict erupted and an estimated 9,600 men, women, and children lost their lives.Clearly that is interfering in the process. So why didn’t President Obama charge Soros as a threat to the United States national security? It’s because Soros flooded Obama and Hillary’s Democratic Party with about $100 million in donations. You really think that Obama is going to charge someone that has donated that much to their party?Soros began his takeover back in 2004, as he declared “it is the central focus of my life” and “a matter of life and death” to push his influence on the American people and our democracy. While 2004 failed, Soros had turned to 2016 and had become Hillary’s highest donor. We know that Hillary listens to people that donate to her, so she would have been listening to Soros the entire time.Now that the Democratic Party has been completely defeated, Soros is doing what he can to go against President Trump, saying “democracy is now in crisis.” Soros has been active in his fight against Trump, as he was discovered to have been the mastermind behind paying protesters to cause as much damage and destruction as possible.During the election season, there were several Black Lives Matter protests that quickly turned violent. These protesters started riots, went up against the police force, and generally made life difficult for law-abiding citizens. Then came a report that Soros was paying these protesters around $15 an hour to protest, and they would have their expenses paid for.It didn’t just stop at the Black Lives Matter protests either. There were several protests against Trump during the election season that turned violent. Again, another report circulated that protesters were getting paid to cause as much destruction as possible.Considering that one of these protests actually shut down a speech that Trump had planned to make, it’s safe to say that they were effective at the time. Not to mention that these people were endangering other people around them and creating a lot of problems for the police forces that were assigned to them.It’s about time that Trump did something against Soros. This man has been responsible for fund","ing so many riots and protests across the country, including the Women’s March that took place the day after Trump’s inauguration. All of these protests have one thing in common: they’re all against Trump and they’re all paid for by Soros.While it’s great to see Trump finally taking action against Soros, there’s a lot more work to be done. Soros has been a thorn in the side of America for far too long, and it’s time that we take him down. The man is a menace and a threat to our democracy and it’s time that we treat him as such."

The pilot, Lieutenant H Jay Cullen, 48, of Midlothian, Virginia, and Trooper-pilot Berke Bates of Quinton, Virginia, died at the scene.The deaths came at the end of a day marked by violent clashes between far-right nationalists and people who had come to protest against their occupation of a downtown park containing a statue of the Confederate general Robert E Lee.Witnesses said those hit by the car were peacefully protesting against the white supremacist rally and footage showed the vehicle crashing into another car, throwing people over the top of it.Play Video 1:34 Virginia governor says 'go home' to white supremacists and nazis – videoCharlottesville: far-right crowd with torches encircles counter-protest group Read moreThe photographer Pat Jarrett, who witnessed the incident, said: “A gray Dodge Charger plowed into a sedan and then into a minivan.

We will do everything in our power to ensure the safety of this community.”The Rev Al Sharpton tweeted: “The hate and violence in Charlottesville is not America.

politifact14940,1,0,"Full text: Jeff Flake on Trump speech transcriptPrepared remarks for Sen. Jeff Flake, who delivered a speech to the Senate on Jan. 17, 2018.Mr. President, near the beginning of the document that made us free, our Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson wrote: “We hold these truths to be self-evident...” So, from our very beginnings, our freedom has been predicated on truth. The founders were visionary in this regard, understanding well that good faith and shared facts between the governed and the government would be the very basis of this ongoing idea of America.Story Continued BelowAs the distinguished former member of this body, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, famously said: “Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not to his own facts.” During the past year, I am alarmed to say that Senator Moynihan’s proposition has likely been tested more severely than at any time in our history.It is for that reason that I rise today, to talk about the truth, and its relationship to democracy. For without truth, and a principled fidelity to truth and to shared facts, Mr. President, our democracy will not last.2017 was a year which saw the truth – objective, empirical, evidence-based truth -- more battered and abused than any other in the history of our country, at the hands of the most powerful figure in our government. It was a year which saw the White House enshrine “alternative facts” into the American lexicon, as justification for what used to be known simply as good old-fashioned falsehoods. It was the year in which an unrelenting daily assault on the constitutionally-protected free press was launched by that same White House, an assault that is as unprecedented as it is unwarranted. “The enemy of the people,” was what the president of the United States called the free press in 2017.The most reliable politics newsletter.

It bears noting that so fraught with malice was the phrase “enemy of the people,” that even Nikita Khrushchev forbade its use, telling the Soviet Communist Party that the phrase had been introduced by Stalin for the purpose of “annihilating such individuals” who disagreed with the supreme leader.This alone should be a source of great shame for us in this body, especially for those of us in the president’s party. For they are shameful, repulsive statements. And, of course, the president has it precisely backward – despotism is the enemy of the people. The free press is the despot’s enemy, which makes the free press the guardian of democracy. When a figure in power reflexively calls any press that doesn’t suit him “fake news,” it is that person who should be the figure of suspicion, not the press.I dare say that anyone who has the privilege and awesome responsibility to serve in this chamber knows that these reflexive slurs of “fake news” are dubious, at best. Those of us who travel overseas, especially to war zones and other troubled areas around the globe, encounter members of U.S. based media who risk their lives, and sometimes lose their lives, reporting on the truth. To dismiss their work as fake news is an affront to their commitment and their sacrifice.According to the International Federation of Journalists, 80 journalists were killed in 2017, and a new report from the Committee to Protect Journalists documents that the number of journalists imprisoned around the world has reached 262, which is a new record. This total includes 21 reporters who are being held on “false news” charges.Mr. President, so powerful is the presidency that the damage done by the sustained attack on the truth will not be confined to the president’s time in ","purpose to do our jobs under our oaths, as elected officials, and in the case of the president, as the chief executive – we can, in the words of our founders, “establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.”The Founders’ words are not parchment barriers. They are not quaint relics to be discarded at the whim of an orange-haired king. They are, rather, the foundation upon which our house rests. They are the rock upon which our experiment in self-government was built.That is why, 230 years after Jefferson penned his magnificent words, we must still hold them close. That is why we must continue, as free people, to hold truth above all else. For if we lose that, Mr. President, then there is nothing left.We must not let that happen. I yield the floor.Please paraphrase this passage, without using any words from the original.Senator Jeff Flake delivered a speech to the Senate on January 17, 2018, emphasizing the importance of truth in a democracy and condemning President Trump's attacks on the media. Flake argued that the President's use of the term ""fake news"" to describe unfavorable coverage is an assault on the Constitution-protected free press, and that his behavior is eroding trust in institutions and threatening the foundations of democracy. Flake urged his colleagues to join him in defending the truth and restoring reverence for institutions."
politifact14289,1,1,"It is being reported that Australia is becoming the first nation in the world to begin microchipping its citizens. This surprising new development is the result of several years of a sustained propaganda that has actually led to Australian citizens voluntarily putting themselves forward for the controversial program.Australia is getting its citizens microchippedShanti Korporaal, who lives in the Australian city of Sydney has found herself at the center of headlines of the new venture after having implants surgically implanted in both of her hands. She says that she has no regrets about the procedure and that she encourages others to follow in her footsteps. The implants are fitted with a unique identifier which can be used to get through locked doors, to transfer personal information into devices and even connected to bank details. ""You could set up your life, so you never have to worry about any passwords or PINs, ""Korporaal told reporters when justifying her decision. Another anonymous individual who had also voluntarily undergone the procedure said that they had done it for the purpose of ‘convenience.'But while it may be convenient in the short-term, the long-term implications of having microchips implanted directly into the human body are terrifying. Modern technology has allowed the government and law enforcement agencies an almost unprecedented level of access to the details of the lives of ordinary citizens. In the United States, there are regular reports that indicate that law enforcement agencies such as the police and the FBI are already tracking cell phones without a warrant on a fairly routine basis. In addition to this, revelations by the whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed that the government is accessing and storing a vast amount of information about every single person, whether they are under suspicion or not, from their online devices.This means that civil liberties campaigners are deeply concerned about this burgeoning trend of microchipping which will essentially allow the government to have a permanent record of a citizen’s every movement and transaction. After all, the only way to remove a surgically implanted microchip is another painful operation. Civil liberties advocates are baffled by the way private citizens are actually volunteering to forego their privacy and security in such an intrusive manner.","The Australian government is set to become the first in the world to microchip its citizens, with several individuals already opting for the controversial procedure. Shanti Korporaal, a resident of Sydney, has had implants inserted in both hands and encourages others to follow suit, citing convenience as the main reason. The microchips can be used to access locked doors, transfer personal information, and even connect to bank details. However, civil liberties campaigners are concerned about the long-term implications of this trend, as it allows the government and law enforcement agencies unprecedented access to citizens' personal information. With the ability to track cell phones and access online devices without a warrant, the government can potentially maintain a permanent record of every citizen's movements and transactions. The willingness of private citizens to surrender their privacy in this way has left advocates of civil liberties perplexed."

While horse meat, technically, can’t be legally sold in the United States for human consumption, it may still turn up in the US food supply because it can be sold to Mexico, then re-labeled and shipped back to the USA as a low-cost meat filler. This has already been documented occurring in Europe, where meatballs sold in European grocery stores were found to be made with horse meat.Where do these horses come from?While horse meat slaughterhouses were banned during the Bush Administration, the ban expired in 2011 under President Obama’s watch, thereby allowing horse meat slaughterhouses to restart operations.Reuters claims that around 130,000 horses are slaughtered each year in Canada and Mexico — and it seems the United States wants a huge chunk of that business, as well.Not-so-fun fact: Most horse meat come from horse owners who decide to have their horses killed for a variety of reasons, such as illness, injury, or simply because they cannot afford to keep their horses fed and cared for anymore.Many of these owners sell their horses to slaughterhouses for an incredibly low amount. Yep, you read that right: They allow strangers to haul their horses away to a meat packing plant, only to be slaughtered mercilessly around several other screaming horses.Do keep all this in mind the next time you consider buying a horse for your family. Raising one requires a tremendous amount of effort, so be a responsible horse owner. Don’t let your pet get slaughtered once you get tired of it — because if you do, it might eventually end up on your plate the next time you purchase some meatballs for your spaghetti.Source used:NaturalNews.com",", 2013 © All rights reserved."
